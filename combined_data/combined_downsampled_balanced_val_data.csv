"Accuracy of step tracking is not good , very worst ... Don't buy ... From my experience.... automatic sensors are not working properly....",1
"Not a worth buy at all, this was my second dir 615 earlier one gave away after 14 months to which I threw it in bin thinking it comes with 1 years warranty only to realize that it had 3 years warranty. So brought this product again and this time it again gave away after 15 months and when I went up to service station they denied my warranty claim stating that router had moisture inside. I had never used this device in damp area and was always mounted on a wall which remains dry throughout the year. Dropped the plan to buy d link forever, on the other hand had purchased a tp link router which was just for some 600 bucks during diwali performed marvelously well and range is even better than d link.",1
It's sad to see the headset break after much research gone into it. It broke within 2 months of light usage. The plastic quality is bad. A little stretch and boom.,1

The advertisement says its. ADSL + Modem Router by this product does not have a modem. It‚Äôs only a router. I want to return this product now !,1
very bad after some days of working,1
Not make happy as expected from Philips brand,1
no,1
"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI. Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone üì±, definitely I will return.

Pros:
Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% üòÄ.
The phone is too lightweight ‚ò∫Ô∏è and very handyüòÑ
Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. üòÉ.

Cons :
All apps are lagging.
Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. üò≠
GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. üò†üò†.
High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.
Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. üò•. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.
Display - Size of the display is quite good üëçBut it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. üò†
Display quality is too poor. üò´ Very cheap quality display.

Ignorable Missing features -
No fingerprint sensor. ü•∫
No led in front of the display.üò∞

Major Missing features -
No gorilla glass protection üò•

If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or aboveü§ó with at least above 290 PPI.

Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy.",1
"Didn't recive any warranty card, and it's seems to be duplicate product.",1
"Worst product from boat. Never buy complete money waste. You cannot talk to a person on the call using the mic, because the person on the call cannot hear you. Sound quality also seems like a local Chinese headphone. Better spend some more money and get a good headphone. Do not even think to buy if you are buying it for the purpose of talking.",1
Camera is not quality,1
Very bad quality. I requested to return bit no one came and now its out of return date,1
"Overall sound good
But sound is able to hear without wear too.

"Remote is bad
They don't give battery üò°",1
"Poor battery no timer, no compass worest watch which is not fit to my hand",1
Worst printer. Unable to detect wifi. Canon service guy came and told mother board is not working and it has to be replace and it would take 10 to 15 days time. Really are you kidding me it‚Äôs a brand new printer how can you say mother board is not working. I have been using Canon camera and it‚Äôs really good that‚Äôs why I preferred canon printer rather than other brand.,1
Range is wortless..i install router next to my room door..still it's just 1 signal comes ..nd some time not even 1..getting reconnect all time..,1
Ordered redmi 9 power but received redmi 9 worst experience,1
I bought this headphone on 4 Oct 2020. This product was very good so far. Suddenly the sound is not clear since last week and today I could not hear any sound when connected to my Laptop or Mobile devices. To my shock I found that the cable is damaged within a span of 3.5 months. The advertisement for this product was misleading and this product carried an year warranty. There is no option available in Amazon to return this product within the warranty period. Hence I am posting this review to benefit from not going for this product.,1
Specifications doesn't match with product,1
Okay okay product,1
This phone came up without proximity sensor. That is difficult while calling.,1
Poor camera qualify,1
Slow coming printer waste of money,1
Can you imagine to shell out huge money and get a printer that doesn't print back to back automatically? Why would anyone manufacture a printer without a duplex printing option and price tag so much? We tried manually printing back to back with 20 pages and it printed everything in the wrong pages. This printer wastes your pages and money as well. Do not buy this product. I would request Epson to stop manufacturing this product in the interest of public usage.,1
"This is not a network printer. The reference to Wi-Fi is misleading.
Also I have been waiting for the last 5 days to get the printer installed. No response from the tech team despite many calls to the customer care. Pathetic service.",1
The product is not worth the price.,1
DISGUSTING CARTRIAGE,1
Not a very good product. Expected something & got something else. Had purchased it in Aug 2017 & now have to replace it. The connection is constantly dropping. Also this router doesn't have a good coverage.,1
"Not worth of the price. Frequent signal drops. Range is not good atall.
Pls dont waste your money. One moment it will give you 80mbps suddenly will drop to 0 and will take few minutes to come back to normal, and this happens quite frequently.
Writing this review after 7-8 days use.",1
Mic stopped working in just 4 months...... Please contact me I want to exchange this faulty product....,1
Worst experience ever. Alao no aftee sales support. Received a faulty watch. Had to email to consumer affairs to fet it swrviced. Service team also veey rude.. Highly recommending not to buy..,1
"Device is not receive as per image. I was expected that the antina was shown in back side of device, but i receive the device with left, right antena. This the updated pruduct of D-link,
Which is not compatible to us. The configuration is much tuffer than previous product and also i realise the reset bottom is not working on this device.

Phone is not good,1
The product is good but the input switch does not work properly and the woofer is heating in few minutes .,1
Waste of money.... Sound quality is zero .... Sound comes like someone talking from very far... Clarity of sound is not good... That's the reason they mentioned only replacement not return.... It's not good policy for Amazon...,1
"I bought the band in October 2019. I had a very bad experience with this band. One day the band accidentally fell into the water, after 1-2 hours from that the band stopped working. It wasn‚Äôt charging. It was warranty period and when given to the Xiaomi Service Centre they refused to repair it and said ‚Äòthat its screen has scratches and it is intentionally broken‚Äô which was not true.
Hope it may be helpful for you.",1
Camera is very very bad quality,1
"JBL service is worst, I had bought the earphone and within months it got defected. MIC stopped working and there is no one to listen to your complain.

Camera quality too poor,1
"I have infinite glide (Jbl) cost 1400,If you are a Music lover ,you can go for Jbl infinity glide for same price.Because Boat 450 won't give you a good experience for listening music,So much noise produced with music ,it will lose quality listening.( I am not talking about noise from the sourrounding) because it almost cover our ears

I have seen many reviews in the youyube most people unnecessarily suporting these brands,And the problem is we can't return the item only replace

Pros.It good looking,Soft ear cups,
Cons.Not at all goo for music (if you are pure music lover with ,good bass,good low and middle ..etc) never buy
If you think aux cable would change the experience ,No I have even tried that one

May be this isbthe reason why they reduced the price",1
Very thin wire than usual with old designed and broke easily... Not worth of money.,1

"In today‚Äôs age, can‚Äôt believe HP is selling a product of this quality. Print quality is bad. Print speed is horrible. Cartridge size is extremely small. Can print less than 30 pages in black. PLUS Amazon return policy is misleading. Don‚Äôt buy unless you want to waste money and time.",1
Bluetooth not supported I want exchange,1
"Very bad connection quality. Keep on disconnecting internet every 5 mins. Then have Disconnect Wi-Fi connection and reconnect. And the troubleshooting steps available doesn't do any good. The major step to resolve the issue is updating the firmware, and the funny thing is the latest firmware is not available on manufacturer website. I rate this product 1 out of 5. 20%. Poor brand. Rather go for CISCO or D link.",1
"Only one of the air buds gets connected at a time, it's showing two different Bluetooth devices for same device and on selection of any only one airbud gets connected. Costumer service is a big scam as on raising complaint just received a mail saying image of product doesn't match. Better to go for some other company rather than going for noise. I have decided not to buy any noise product because of their poor customer service. One year warranty is just a eyewash",1
"I have canon, epson, and hp printers.
I have been using all the brands but canon disappointed me very much.

First this printer starts giving issue within a year I have two one for personal one for office use.

As soon as the warranty expires canon customer service guys are the most horrible fraudulent people i have come across.

They will blame the ink is duplicate ( i bought it from amazon with registered dealer ). Or we have to replace this part and that without even looking. I took a cloth and cleaned the head and everything was working fine.
For any small things which can be solved over phone they we will visit and charge you service fees.

I have a hp and epson printers which are working fine since 4 yrs lilttle issue after two years but thats fine",1
This product not work properly üò°,1
Cheap Chinese garbage,1
"It stops working after 2mins of power cut,please don‚Äôt be fool
Stop buying this product",1
"Recently bought the TP Link Archer C6(US) Hardware version 3.2. This router is good when you consider the speed alone. Wifi devices configured in this router loose the internet connection at random time, and to regain the internet you have to restart the router. Interesting thing is that your device 1 may be working fine with internet connectivity but at the same time device2 shows no internet. This is discussed extensively in the TP Link forum in this header ""Archer c6 ""no internet access"" and sometime not connecting to the wifi saying ""limited connection"". Seems to be a firmware issue, but loosing the internet connection in middle of an office call is not a good choice (with the fact that the internet connection is still present but the router just denied it for some of the wifi clients)",1
This product will be working one speaker,1
"The monitor is indeed good but of substandard build quality. I purchased it in August 2020 for 8k. Till a week back it was working fine and then suddenly when I wake up one morning there is a black line on the screen. I contacted customer support. They registered the call but when the technician visited he said it is damaged and I can't do anything, you better buy a new one as the cost to replace a panel is the same as this monitor (WHAT?). I was keeping the monitor really well and it did not fall at all, had it fallen it would have had some dents, there were zero dents and scratches. In this Oct sale, I purchased the Dell Monitor which should last longer than this BenQ thing. I really thought well of the product after reading the reviews but it indeed turns out of substandard build quality.

Poor aftersales support.",1
"Print ink didn't survive for 40 prints!
Disappointing!",1
"Quality of this product is at the least. Plastic quality is very poor. After looking at the product felt that there are couple of other brands with much better build quality than this one.

I'll not suggest anyone to go for this one.",1

Lan wire cheap quality.
Dont buy online its my personal experience.",1
"I bought this product seeing reviews. This was my first time buying a pTron product. Terribly disappointed. When the product received, I immediately noticed the left earbud isn't doesn't have a perfect seal in ear. When I tried to play audio, the left earpiece has low volume.
I tried all earbuds of all sizes but nothing fixes it. I ordered for a replacement, received it successfully(great work amazon!), but that was faulty too.
I realized pTron designed the earphone to meet just this level of quality. I immediately returned the product and was told by amazon to wait for 5 days to get refund.

My conclusion: If you have only used local cheap no brand earphones, you might like the Bluetooth feature and don't care much about sound. But for one who used any quality earphones in past can't tolerate the subpar sound quality.
Still if you want it, buy it only for less than Rs. 400(399). It's not worth more than that.",1
"Guys, Please don't waste money. This is worst product.",1
Printer did not print,1
Don't buy this if u wish to buy an Indian product although in Google Search we found it made in india,1

"Doesn‚Äôt work properly. Major issues of watch and app: (iphone user)
1. App always disconnect from the watch. Sometimes watch wont sync with app. You need to reset the watch. It happened for me 4 times in my last 1 month experience.
1. Sync with apple health gives wrong step datas to iphone. It updates each time cumulative steps. And my 2000 steps became 16000 steps in apple health
2. Weekly average of any activity is not calculating by the app
3. App always asks for updates, even there is no update available.
4. Day time sleep can‚Äôt be calculated and detected by the watch and app. Night sleep pattern itself updates after a long time.
5. Handwash, drink water reminders are not working all the time.

Pros:
Reading like SpO2, stress, steps are accurate.",1

"Bluetooth gets disconnected from your laptop frequently. during a 1 hour call the voice gets disconnected at least once. very uncomfortable, I had to use the AUX often to quickly reconnect during the call.",1
Low quality volume,1
"DO NOT BUY!! I can go on and on about the problems I faced with this headphone after using it for 4 months.

Evry time it connects via bluetooth, the auto voice says that the headphone is connected and it also says ambience sound off/on or nice cancellation. And the mode doesnt stay the same once power is off and on. So evry meeting I miss the initial 15 seconds of the meeting.

Battery % is discrete, it either says battery is 20%,,50% or 70% and you would never get to know what exactly is the battery %. Which decade are you in, sony designers??

Coming to calls, the stupidest thing is if you are not on mute, the people on the other end complain of noise from their end. Most of the time goes in muting and uniting the device during meetings. If noise cancellation is not ON, people on receiving end have problem hearing you.

The connecting wire is too small, I cannot move away more than 2 feet from the pc.

You will have to press and hold the power button like forever to turn on or off. I dont understand why would a 10k worth headphone have this kind of sluggishness.

It does not connect to two devices at a time, which is a manageable problem though but I would expect that when they are costing this much.

It's been 4 months of usage and the layers are already ripping out, very disappointing cheap product.

It gets heated up in the left ear if you connect to pc.

Noice output is also not loud enough.
Overall, what a worst experience!

Reducing to one star.
Customer care called and told that they ll get someone to sort out the connectivity issue, but as expected, no one called and nothing happened.
Initial review remains the same. STAY AWAY AND AVOID BUYING.
‚Äê---------

Good battery backup. Rest is below average.
Connectivity on android via noise app is horrible.
One cannot change the sleep tracking as per personal requirement.
Notification for calls is faulty n watch doesnt stop vibrating even after the call is picked.
Not worth the price. Tried returning but noise doesnt have tht option.
Probably they already know the worth of this watch n hence return option is not made available to the buyer.
STAY AWAY AND AVOID BUYING",1

"I really don't understand how most Youtubers missed this most important part of the review.

If you even have an average sized skull, then too this on-ear headphone will give you pain and discomfort on your ears that is beyond you can imagine.
The ear cushions are made of artificial leather - look material which gets hot pretty quickly.

And trust me, I have had headphones in my past. But on this, I can't even listen comfortably beyond 10 minutes. I feel like breaking this.
Also, there is no option to return, only replace options.

This is shit man!

Don't ever buy this headphones.

Sound Quality :-
The audio quality is average.

Bass Quality:-
Bass is not punchy, rather muffled. But it gets the job done.

The only good thing about this headphone is the battery life. Easily beyond 60 hours of insane usage.

I wish I could either change the ear cups or maybe return this. Either way, I am stuck with it.
Imagine having a pair of headphones that look good, have decent sound quality, great battery life but misses out on the most important feature of an on-ear headphone which is ""comfort"". Because nothing else matters when you can even listen to this even for 20 minutes!

A big disappointment. Will never buy headphones for Boat again. My first and last purchase.
Thank you for wasting my money.",1

Hardware: The looks are good the activity mode has four modes that are good, there are stopwatch and timer which are also good, the battery backup is decent, it works for around 10 days.
Software: this is the most pathetic app that I have seen in my life. The app does not do the tracking which is the most important part of this product. This version or the latest version of the app is not able to track sleep hours at all, it will show you steps for today but by tomorrow everything will be gone. I have attached the screenshots of the app that shows that I have walked for only three days and slept for only three days in last 25 days of continuously wearing this device. The other screenshots are from the health app from Apple that shows my walking and sleeping trends.
The previous version of the app Was also not working as the app used to say update and there wasn‚Äôt any update in the App Store.
The app has been full of bugs from the beginning and I have seen it like that from last two months. You can verify my comments by going in the App Store or play store and sorting the reviews by latest first. I don‚Äôt think the app is going to improve in future
My verdict: please do not buy this otherwise you‚Äôll be disappointed. Thanks!",1

When I went to market to get it repaired, all the printer repair shops shared one common notion HP printers aren't repairable, they don't provide any item parts unlike Epson which needs less repairs and if required parts are available in ample quantity.",1
"Totally unsatisfied with the product
The watch is very loose with the straps",1
I bought it to connect Dahua DVR to my PC so that I can view the connected cameras through internet. But the mechanic said it is not compatible for this purpose. Rather I should buy Wi-Fi router with modem from TP link which is compatible for this purpose. So I need to buy another device and this will become just a waste of my money.,1
Speed from this router is very low (2.3 Mbps). I tried with another tp link router (26 Mbps) with fast speed test with same ISP. Tested for three days.,1

"So that 1 star is for after sales support. I made this purchase in Jan 2020 & Product was fine at the cost of 699. I anyways was not expecting a bose or a sony output at the price which i was paying. It fulfilled my purpose for which i bought it, primary handsfree calling and receiving calls. Otherwise listening music was very less however since i am not a music geek so it solved that purpose also. Kind of ok and acceptable.
Now just after 6 months in June 2020 one earplug stopped working and audio stops coming during calls and music for few seconds
The concrete claim of company of warranty or guarantee whatever they call it, fall abosultely flat from there onwards. It is been more then 20+ days since i wrote on their support email and had almost 7-8 follows up in the last 20 days and i got response of only 1 that to asking me to send pictures and invoice which I did same day. However still waiting for a response since last 10 days. I don't know if any one was able to connect on their customer care number 04067138888 because i was not able to since 25th june. I have also attached the call log list . It always says this number is busy.
The problem is not about the 699 rs replacement. It worked for 6 months and i took it as fine and absolutely ok with its life of 6 months at that price.
It is about commitment that the company makes and then completely refuses to honour it, by not even responding in any way whether the value of the product is 100 or 100000, if compay mention warranty then it should be taken care of.
However my experience with Ptron was not worth remembering.
Anyon buying their product can check on their customer care number or service mechanism before buying unless they are buying for a single time use.",1
"Initially I ordered for 27"" monitor, and I received 24"". Then it got replaced. And then at very 14th day after I got the replaced product, It's main board got damaged and I was unable to connect using HDMI cable.

Their Manager Deepak Khurana is on leave, and his represent member Om Prakash himself says that he cant do anything without Deepak. Let him return from leave. The entire team just play email - email within their own team only, and the customer just watches the show as an Audience. It's almost a week now and I have still not got any result.

"this review is being done after usage for couple of weeks.

first thing I want to say is that I am utterly disappointed with the camera.... the following are the good and bad about the camera.

good:
- economical price for an action camera but please read below
- delivered on time

bad:
- picture quality is very very bad
- for namesake its says 4k but the resolution, color, brightness, pixels writing/processing is very bad
- even the lower resolution output is very bad
- if you zoom in the 4k 30 or 60, you will find pixels floating... wonder if it is with my cam or that's what the quality is
- pictures is as bad as video
- UI is manual and badly designed
- battery has no indicators saying this much is available
- battery charge dont indicate the battery is full
- while the camera in action, it wont give you warning... it simply switches off
- when charging, it opens up camera and drains of all battery even if plugged
- it has WiFi but its a huge effort to get connected with the mobile using a hopeless app
- you take 4K 60FPS, but it shows 4K 30FPS on its properties... I enquired on this and the seller/responser says that its a bug in the software and if requested they will send the link to update the software.... the cam is made 7-8 months back and this could have been updated... uff you manufacturer, you could have sorted out this
- few accessories are provided but you will not find manual of using it...
- it just give you 50 to 60 mins of continuous video and wont give you advance warning
- tried all the settings from ISO, white balance, sharpness, balance etc but the quality remains very poor.

I would have been happy if the video quality is at-least good and rest remains as is.... Not recommended even to the beginner...",1

Firstly, there is no specific customer care number. They don't take your calls and if you manage to find their numbers on google, they will make you call multiple contacts. I had to call 5 different numbers to get some help.
Secondly, you have to courier the router with your own money to their so called ""pick up center"".
Thirdly, they'll take a month to deliver another refurbished and another damaged product to you, only to find out that, it doesn't work either.
Fourth, you have to pay for this damaged item that got delivered to you.
Now I'm fee up with their service. I am giving up, it's not worth spending 100 bucks everytime I have to send to their ""pick up center"". I am going for a reputed company's router who is capable of replacing a damaged item.",1

"subject: wrong Calorie count in Noise colourfit pro3

At first after seeing all the advertisement, i was very impressed by the features of the watch, as being fitness enthusiast I wanted to check my calorie count while I workout. The calorie count feature was my main priority which was why I ordered the watch in first place.

But when I started wearing the watch, I was very disappointed by that calorie count feature. At first the watch used to show me a low calorie count even though I did g high intensity workout. I have attached a picture showing 6.14km 7978 steps but just 59 calories! which is practically impossible.i thought it was a glitch at the first, I even tried to contact the service centre but there was no response.

Now the situation has crossed the limits. As you can see in another picture attached below 7.73km, 11420 steps and still 0 calories WOW!!
THIS WAS REALLY NOT EXPECTED FROM NOISE. I was delivered a defective product.

Surely this is very disappointing and for a consumer which buys a product for a reason finds it very annoying.
I am trying to register my complaint since the first week.
I want this product to be replaced.
order placed: 13.04.2021
Product Recieved: 15.04.2021
Ordered from amazon.

"There are so many wrongs with this product. (ax10)
1) The range is mediocre.
2) WIFI-6 atleast on this device is a grand joke
3) Biggest problem: The WIFI keeps dropping after some time. I screwed my ISP and he installed the old router which worked like cream. So this crap wasted a whole day of mine.
4) The setup is relatively easy, but the one mesh is a real mess. Don't expect wonder.
5) My old router was giving me 100+ speed on 5G. This crap is giving 60 to me. What a joke. INR 5k well wasted.

"Not sure why this router gets rated so highly. The reviews posted are not worth trusting. The 2.4 Ghz band is simply non functional. I was using a D-Link DIR-600L earlier. I faced no buffering issues on it. The connection is a 60 Mbps fiber broadband.

My sony tv would buffer on youtube & primevideo no matter what combination of settings I tried(channel bandwidth, channels, b/g/n settings) on this router. The 5 Ghz band works really well and is stable but the 2.4 Ghz has high ping, low speed and data loss even when I am running a speed test standing next to the router. My 6 year old router performs way better than this one when it comes to reliability and stability of the 2.4 Ghz wifi. Since its a dual band router, both the bands should work fine, but that's not the case. Only 5Ghz band is functional. Also, the UI is laggy for some reason.
At first I thought the unit I received is defective so I got it replaced. But the replacement had the same issue. You can check that this is a widespread issue by a simple google search.

Update: Bought Netgear R6260 and both its wifi bands work flawlessly. No disconnections, low ping and expected uniform speeds on both bands.",1

Not as per requirement,1
Getting ear pains,1
Mercusys AC 1200. Signal strength even in the 2.4ghz band was really low. There is a reason they sell it for so cheap at around INR 1600. This is an inferior product if you expect even decent signal inside the house. So returned it and bought TP-link Archer A6 and the difference is night and day. Unless you are using it in a 500-600 sqft space without any walls do not get this.,1

But to my surprise, TP link router started giving me trouble from the 2nd day by frequently logging me out as and when power supply gets interrupted. And after 1 month's use, the router looks faulty and I am behind the customer support for replacement. Thanks to the seller, tp link and amazon for getting me into these trouble.",1

"Writing a review after 4 months of usage.

The wifi is easy to setup and use. There are two channels 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz.

I'm using a 100Mbps internet at home and I get the full speed (literally 100Mbps) on 5Ghz channel.
However the maximum speed that I'd get on 2.4Ghz is hardly 40Mbps.

The smart switch (that automatically switches between these two channels) is also not giving speeds more than 70Mbps.

I called the customer care to address the issue on the speed and the interaction was full of surprises.

First thing, the technical representative is not so technical. I had to explain him the difference between MB and Mb.

Second, he said that it's expected to have a data loss of up to 50% on this router. I don't even know why one should go for such a pathetic router (after I informed him saying that no solution he provided had worked).

Third, he's not completely aware of the router specifications. I was surprised to hear that their company doesn't claim the support of 867Mbps on 5Ghz channel (which when later verified was proved to be false. I could download the spec from their website which clearly mentions it)

Fourth, being not so satisfied with the interaction, I wrote am email to the tech support team to look into the matter, but it's been more than 3 weeks with 2 reminders, but no one has responded so far.

So, after sale service is pathetic. Please don't go for this. We have better ones in the market",1
Very bed frequency dont buy this router and even one flor not covered this router in 300 squarefeet,1
"I don‚Äôt know how people are rating this product so high. It has no accuracy at all.
I stay awake till 2 am and by default it starts showing my sleep cycle around 11 pm everyday.
SPO2 tracker shows figure between 95 and 98 all the time and worst parr is that even if u keep it over a fabric like handkerchief, blanket, trouser etc it shows the spo2 values.
It shows a fixed heart rate even of clothes.
Blood pressure sensors has the same story
Battery will never last more than 2.5 to 3.5 days even in average use. If u use it with full features turned on then for sure it won‚Äôt last for more than 2 days.
Slorts mode is faulty too. I sleep with watch on my wrist and in morning i see that i have walked 300 steps in my sleep.
Display quality is very much average.
All together it‚Äôs not worthy to buy for accuracy and battery life.",1

"Update:

Post my multiple complaints the LG engineer visited and diagnosed a display issue and a new display was ordered. The engineer visited again to replace the damaged display with the new display but he as struggling to get it to work and the new display never worked. So he put the old display back and left. LG has become a joke. I‚Äôve had the need for another monitor lately and went for Lenovo and I recommend none of you choose LG; LG makes good looking but worst quality monitors. Cheers.

Original review:

This is the worst monitor I‚Äôve purchased ever. Seemed like a good buy while ordering but have been facing severe edge bleeding within 1 year if my purchase and the monitor has a 3 year warranty. The quality of the product is very very substandard and I request all prospective buyers to be very very careful while buying this. I‚Äôve seen many other reviews with the same issue and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be a one off case. LG really needs to make sure that a monitor in this pride range doesn‚Äôt have such issues within months of the purchase. Request Amazon for a replacement ASAP else I‚Äôll have no option but to escalate this to the Amazon India and LG management and call them out for this quality and service. Such a shame. I almost feel scammed.",1
Over all look and battery life is ok. A lot of problem in pairing and it's connectivity. Will get better product in market,1

"Ok, first let me just give a small background. I've used almost all brands of earphones in thia price range, including AudioTechnica, Sennheiser, House of Marley, Beats, Skullcandy, Boat, Boult, etc.

Must say JBL's this particular model is the worst as far as performance goes.

Now, this model is really bad as far as music is concerned. Lacks depth, lacks bass (and I'm talking about natural bass, forget boosts and all) and is really cranky.

This is good if your primary requirement is to take calls or attend webinars, etc. But for music, it is plain no no.

I would not recommend this product.

Maybe JBL has some other models which are better. I haven't tried them yet. Would love to try and share my thoughts.",1

The warranty claim option is not available with amazon,1
Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.,1
I received a used one despite or paying for a new one. With no user Manual and a broken seal. The charger was connected to the device when I opened the box. By Far not a very good experience.,1

Product worked fine for the first 10 days. After that 3.5mm headphone PIN is loose and doesn't work most of the time.,1
"The watch fails at every thing it is expected to do.
1. The time shown on the watch keeps getting slower and does not show correct time. You will be forced to go to the app everytime and hit the sync time option.
2. The steps counter is arbitrary, it is even counting steps if yiu are sitting idle. During activity the step count is atleast 30% more than actual.
3. The heart rate does not work properly, even if set at taking a reading every 15 mins, the app is not showing any data.
4. No option to measure blood oxygen.
5. Do not know what sensors are used on the watch, you literally need to press a button to wake this watch up. Rotating the wrist does nothing 90 out of 100 times.

This is sham of a watch, not even a watch..a real watch atleast shows proper time.

Note: I purchased directly from noise website, writing the review only for the benifit of others who should not get into this trap.",1

Really disappointed. Got a defective piece and I'm trying for the last three four days to return the item or even get a replacement done. I'm very disappointed with the service provided by Amazon. I'm not even getting any technical help from Philips. It shud be Amazon's responsibility to replace the item when it is defective. Externally there is no damage but the speakers are not working at all. I never expected this kind of service from Amazon. Please replace the item or else refund the money and take the speakers back. Atleast send a technician to have a look and replace the item. Very disappointed.,1

3. Have not validated the health segemnt (BP, SPo2 and HR) so will not comment but felt it is also not accurate.

Don't believe that it supports 865mpbs in 5ghz or 450mpbs in 2.5 GHz. If u plan to buy 200mbps plan or higher always check that the router has gigabit port or else its a fraud. Just go with dlink products. Also it's gud for only 100mbps plan.,1
"The naming and the marketing of this router is misleading, they clearly state that the wifi band 2.4 ghz can support 300mbps and 5ghz support 800+mbps but the input port, in which the connection from your ISP supports maximum of 100mbs. The latter thing is no where mentioned in description and not even on the routers packaging. You will only find out that in the router configuration portal.

So if you have got a plan for 100mbps speed from your ISP, don't go for this router. Go for a higher model like Archer C6 gigabit.",1

It has lasted me more than 1.5 years before a need for change. But band 5 strap looks so flimsy.... I doubt if it will last even 3 months if I remove and wear the band on a daily basis.

"App. - After a few days, I think, Amazon, Flipkart shall be replaced by Goqii app. Yes, it sells online coaching, live training, body nutrients, food supplements, t-shirt other smart device ... what not?! Now, after long investigation, I found a small icon at top that will bring you in your required place. Here you can add the watch to app. But ... You have to synchronise manually every time. It is a market place rather than a serious health tracking app

B.P. Measure - You may get customised bp as you wish !! The watch can not measure bp if it is not linked to app. Now, the first time when you link the watch to measure bp, the app says for calibration. You need to put 3 pre measured bp readings in the app. Game starts from now ... The watch gives you an av. reading of the 3 input reading as given by you for calibration. Just for checking, I gave 3 very high bp readings and the watch returns high av. on my hand. Then I gave 3 low readings and got in return low av. bp on my same hand !!

Steps - Worked on table for 30 mins ... Watch shows 92 steps !!

I think, exercise on these basic fields are ssufficient for not drilling any further ...",2

- it has a memory problem. It forgets settings after say every 6 months or so

"Overall good, but not supported to my router since my router adapter needs around 9v and it has 5v capacity... want to replace but return window crossed... seeking warranty support now.",2
For this price product is ok(rs 349). But overall not a great product. Bass quality is superb. But i don't know why people boast it. Once you get a headphone with immersive sound quality you never choose for bass only. I had a mi headphone which superb for immersive experience. Comparing that this is not good. I suggest buy more quality headphone if you can afford the price. Its good if your budget is around 400rs,2
"Sound quality is good. However, JBL compromised on quality of material. Unexpected n highly disappointed. I purchased it 2 months back. Wiring is pretty cheap. So, u gotta handle with outmost care. I handled with outmost care, still I'm facing this issue. Can't hear anything from the right side of headphone. This is within warranty; however, I didn't get any number from Amazon regd. Seller to claim the warranty.",2

The color gets dirty very easily. The tracking monitor and it's reading is not completely accurate. I would rate it as an average watch,2
Sound is loud... But not clear sound..,2
Average.Still not tasted.,2
"Sleep tracking was worst! It said I slept just for 1/2 hour whereas I had complete 8 hours sleep. Syncing problem made streak break again and again! Morning when I woke up it was saying I walked 64 steps. Maybe it was tracking me in my dreams also.
All over worst product by Xaomi so far.
Go for Honor Smart Band 5, its more accurate",2
"This jbl earphones doesn't have a high bass but the sound effects are very well

Changer is very worst,2
"Customer service is very bad.
Only 2 service center are located in Mumbai.",2
"I bought this for my dad under the blind assumption that since its a JBL, must be good. Lifelong user of Audio Technica here. I expected these to be a little heavy on the bass. And it is as expected. If bass is the only thing that you need from your music, go for this. Else, it's a definite no-go. I bought these as a replacement for Motorola earphones that come in the box. Sadly, those have a better quality compared to these.",2
House work only,2
Headphone works awesome for one month after that left one stop working properly. Sound quality becomes not that good.,2
"I have been using this printer as a backup to my main printer(for office use, mainly PDF's) since almost 3 years now. Its easy to install and the scanner works well.The print quality is good but the print yield is very low. The cost of printing is too high. The cost of buying a replacing cartridge(too expensive)or getting the old one refilled is a task as if the refill is done wrong, it doesn't work or it leaks.

Suggestions don't buy this printer, look for a different one that you can refill ink easily or a laser printer that uses toner. Its cheaper in the long run.

PS : You can see how to open the old cartridge and refill it on YouTube and it works. Buy canon ink off amazon and use original Ink for better life.

"Not a good router . WiFi speed fluctuations, ping time too high.
No technical support. After knowing the fact that speed fluctuations is due to router...Really disappointed.",2
The left side lobe came off in 3 months,2
Too bad product within one month it's earphones jack and charging socket becoming loose and not charged properly . it takes minimum 4 to 5 hours for full charging and battery performance too bad it discharge within 5 hours while normal functions are used.,2
Rotating holder.The holder too short so that you can keep phone in vertical mode.. You can keep phone in horizontal mode,2
I bought these ear phones on January 7th. Worked fine for 10 days and later problem started that people were not able to hear my voice when i'm speaking through these earphones. Its completely waste of money and can't return the product also as its already crossed 15 days of return time.,2
Not useable,2
"No fingerprint reader.
Battery drains.
Display sucks.
Video quality pathetic",2
It's really very easy to install very tough to install it's app and use it. It will not work under Indian server. I'm unable to play PUBG will show you an server error every time. It's made for chaina but sold in India.,2
Not as expected,2

The mic stopped working right after the return period and also the plastic used is not of good quality.,2

If iam sleeping or doing some work at computer then how it shows my foot steps. Mean I was doing work at leat for 1 hour and band showing that you walk 750 foot steps.ü§∑,2
You cannot contact customer care one on one. No response to the emails. No call back received. The only contact which use to be busy all the time. If anyone is buying Ptron products then please be sure to risk. If there is a need of replacement under warranty then you would not do that. I am chasing to get my headset replaced since last one month.,2

2. Pain in ear & head in first 4 days it's tight even after 4 days it's stillI cause pain in ear after 40min & I didn't able wear it after 1.5 hours because it's heavy Cause headpain.
3. Over price didn't diserve more than ‚Çπ1200 I buy to in 1000 so it's worth.
in 50% volume battery backup around 8 hours backup
4. Bass is good & above average sound is crystal clear
5.Good plastic use in headphone but one side Brock after 5 months.
After sale service is worst go with infinity
Because infinity or JBL is best.

I gave 2 star it's slightly over priced max to max I gave 1200 it's not deserve more than 1200 I will but it in 1000 & it's best deal in 1000",2
black &white cartage is not sensing ; request checking / repairing,2
Its waste of money. Better to buy a reputate brand. Build up with very cheap materials. Even u can smell the cheapness. Also the quality of sound is not so good. Just giving 2* for the daring to build a 5.1 home theater in such low price.,2
Very bulky,2
Cartrage will not last for longer and replacing cartridge is difficult task,2
Worest printer dont buy this printer.....,2
The mobile started lagging even on Normal uses and sometimes turns off randomly. The battery is not so good.,2
"The product is defective. Just after one month its speaker is not working and sound is coming in only one earpiece.
It is a very bad quality product",2
The head cover broke at the expandable portion,2
".I bought this for someone else who did not like it. Average. Light display is disturbing specially at night while sleeping it ligts up and destroys sleep .
Steps tracking is average. I found mi band better at tracking and giving me a preview.
The display seems good however swiping movements are not user friendly.
A little disappointed as mi band was better than noise fit. Have been using this watch for 6 months now. Ready to trade it in",2
I purchased this product last week and needed a replacement since the end connector has loose connection. Unfortunately the replacement delivered also has the same issue but Iam keeping it. Sound quality is pretty average. A samsung earphobe that comes along with mobile is much better in quality.,2
Chaarger is not working..,2
"The product worked well for the first year. Now the battery has stopped working. Called the seller. Looks like the warranty is only for 6 months and it doesn't cover battery. So, overall not a very reliable product",2
Consumes hours to reconnect daily morning or whenever the phone gets switched off or gets disconnected,2
Below average product,2
"The signal strength is pretty weak specially 5ghz and it‚Äôs pretty unstable as well. This product has less wireless coverage area, as unable to get the coverage on the first floor as the device is installed at ground floor. My previous router with single antenna used to provide much better coverage than this one.",2
Bad parformence...,2
Network Range not so good,2
Default piece received the cartridge is empty in only 10 blak and white print. The colour cartridge is empty.....,2
5G band works good but no range. 2.4G band is a pathetic. There is no range nor good connectivity. Go for it only if all of your devices are 5G band compatible. I wish I could have given this back.,2
"Not at all comfortable gives me pain when i use this

everything else is good",2
"Phone is OK. This phone is suitable for those who are shifting from feature phone to Android phone.
Update after 2 months :-
Phone is having continuous auto restart issue. Checked in Samsung authorised service center, according to them there is problem in this Samsung device. Even after software update, the problem still persist. I purchased this device for my father, He is to much annoyed with this phone. Samsung has messed up with this phone.",2
"Pathetic sounded like the ones you get for 100rs . Did not seem to be original product.i have purchased jbl products but this was a terrible choice to make.
Please check the buyer before you go for the product",2
Only 1 year warranty on flipkart its 3 year warranty,2
"Recently i bought this headphone at 499. it allover budget n cheap headphone around amazon with few repudiated brands. after 2-3 day regular use, realized it's cheap material quality as cheap price, it may able to use for 1-2 hr use.. not more.. cable n jack qaulity quite good but not good at headphone at all.",2
Surround speakers are not powerful.,2
"Non durable products, only the advertisement and external designs are good. Product not even lasting for 10 months. So if you are ok to spend 399 for 9-10 months then go for it. Don't expect any Caring from Customer care. I have ordered 6 products now three are not working.",2
Disconnect frequently,2
After reading the reviews I bought this. Can't compare this to redmi earphones. Sound quality is poor all round. Extremely disappointed.,2
Sound quality and noise cancellation is worst,2
Consuming cartridges very fast.. Was not lasted for prints even 1/4 of what was claimed,2
Not very good,2
Average performance,2
"Highly inacurate, especially for outdoor running. Very disappointing.",2
"I bought it as I wanted in interrupted internet, but after a year of usage the battery backup is less than 5 minutes. When I contacted service center they told that battery cannot be replaced.
If I have to spend 2k per year it's not worth the investment.
I could very well buy 600VA ups which can provide lot more better benefit than this.",2
Poor battery life and all features are combined in one screen if u select one feature it will take another feature,2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I have received only 1 screen, I ordered 2 screens, it says order complete",2
"Had high expectations, but the earphones have started showing aberration in a month. They claim for an year warranty but wantes me to travel to another city to drop the earphones for 'inspection' and only then will they be exchanged 'if deemed fit'. Pure Scam. Really disappointed.",2
Wastage of money not give 100 printout Cartridges is finished and cost of cartridges is near about Rs700 to Rs 800,2
The product was having some internal issues . There was some sound coming from inside thought of returning but unfortunately lost it the same day. 1 purchased 2 out of which black one is working well but this pink one was having some problem. As per the look frankly speaking they don't look OG and I don't find it worth. I found it too expensive as per the quality.,2
Highly disappointed with this product,2
Head and ear hurts a lot. Also there's this metal which scratches and pulls hairs. Weird design.,2
Looks good but camera not good,2
"The overall rating is 2/5.
If you are looking for sleep tracking, it's better to go with honor band 4. The sleep tracking in Amaze fit Bip U is miserable. Not at all accurate & not properly functioning.
The workout mode is fine. The Battery life is a maximum of 4 days, most probably 3 days. The band will count steps if you are riding a bike.
Battery life rating 1/5.
Sleep tracking 2/5.
Spo2-3/5.
Heart rate monitoring 4/5.
Communications (incoming call notification)-2.5/5.
I won't recommend this to anyone. Only good as a watch with a big dial, cannot tell this as a health tracking device. While you are receiving a call you will get a notification, some times even after you answered the call, the watch will vibrate and show you the notification unless you turn it off manually.",2
Worst products always when phone srincronize than received all notification and call other wise use only as watch,2
"Worst headphones I ever bought it broke after just a week. Very cheap build quality. After connecting it through bluetooth, the video call quality drops drastically to the point you cannot hear the voice from other side even if you have a good internet connection.",2
Internet connectivity is so poor. U cannot use two apps at a time using internet.,2
"It takes more time to print, don't buy this one",2
This mobile is not work proper .mobile software is not update,2
It's a whole lot if lies with this Useless router. You never get speed over 75Mbps on 5Ghz even when standing next to the router.,2
Got damaged within 4minths of purchase...it's been one month since I returned it to jbl service center but not received any replacement. worst service.philips earphone which I purchased for 350 lasted more than 2years. Didn't expected this type of quality from JBL,2
"Poor phone,, I'm mistaking to buy this phone. Nobody like this, I'm lost 6k rupee if I take this money for charity I will take blessings to allüòûüòûüòû",2
"Pros:
*Sturdy and sleek design
*Decent battery back up
*Good Bluetooth connectivity
*Comfortable to wear over a long duration
*Touch interface is smooth with very little latency

Cons:
*Terribly tinny music
*Barely any perceivable bass
*Over calls, the ambient sound is transmitted along with the voice.
*No noise cancellation - not even passively.

Verdict: Choose other brands in the same price range.",2
Expected better quality than what I have received. Hopeless. With in 500 Rs you will get far better quality in market.,2
"Please don't buy this product. Had bad experience using it. Pros:- bass high and good (only). Cons:- all other sounds leaving bass are not clear and poor in quality, also bass is soo high that u cannot hear other sounds clearly and nicely.",2
"The product was fine by the look but the voice always cracks. Some defects on the product I guess. I returned it. The delivery cover was damaged and there were tape on it. I think the product given is not a new but refurbished.
Hope Amazon will have compensating solution for this. Thank you.",2

"Please don't purchase redmi low budget phone.
Instead of redmi go other brand infinix",2
"Seller has sent me mobile with software problem.You can not download YouTube also.
Phone is good but seller is not good",2
I really liked the earphones but only for the first 2 months. Then one of the earphones stopped working and my phone calls randomly get cut or muted and the jack is now a bit loose for the slot which earlier wasn't. I recommend it for small span usage...not for more than 3 months.,2
Wire quality is extreme waste.,2
Speakers Acha hai but Sound quality bakbas hai,2
"Wireless printing is only plus point , otherwise its like any other simple printer no difference . Just doing its purpose .
scanning , printing , copying .

Printing quality is very poor , its not printing actual colors . Very disappointed . Please don't buy this printer .",2
Doesnt cover even 450sq.ft. I had heard concerns with Dlink but went ahead with purchase mistakenly,2
"Sound bursting problem. While connecting to Bluetooth it makes very annoying sound and sound gets burst.
Started having problem with my ear",2
"The product is clearly overrated. For 500 bucks i would say the product is overpriced, it's just the brand you are paying. The build is quite light, it looks like one of those local Chinese earphones . The sound quality is okayish. My complementary Samsung earphones provided better sound quality. The wire lenght is just fine not too long , easy to detangle. Noise cancellation is good though and bass is alright. At times the voice gets buzzy even after being properly connected.",2
"This is not sufficient for kids printouts. If you need to print once in a while then it is fine.
Cartridge is getting empty after few prints",2
After using for 3 months suddenly motherboard of sound system got damaged..,2
"WiFi signals are weak.. Even a ‚Çπ700 tiny Tenda router gives you same range.

5Ghz signals are weaker than 2.4Ghz. Big size and 4 antennas actually create problems to fit it on a wall.

I don't think the cost is justified. No USB port for sharing storage.",2
"After using it for a year, this router signal has become unstable... It keeps disconnecting and requires router reboot to work again. Even after connected to wifi there will be no internet and it starts working after reboot.",2
Sound quality is very bad the buds r very hard to listen for long time and battery backup is 5 hrs when we high the volume the sound bass is not good,2
I am not satisfied of this product,2
Actually no finger print thent how it possible to rate this. Phone sometimes hanging and playing but battery life is good,2
Screen hangs after just one year. Serious memory problems.,2
"Disappointed with the range which it bosted about in its description and website

My earlier TP link wireless n router 300 Mbps give me better signal strength than this router across my house

Won't recommend for a row house",2
"Printing and xerox, extremely slow speed ,dispointed",2
"Camar quality is poor
Phone in not good my suggest in not a phone to book",2
"Camera quality is 3rd class
Selfi camera is too bad,my face became red while taking selfi.",2
Got used product.... the package seal is already opened..... the charging wire is not in packing and the band is already on when recieved...there is no cover on the screen of the band. And also didn‚Äôt get the bill of the product.,2
Steps count is so worst that I calculated it manually.. I walked 24 steps but it shows somewhere around 120+ steps.. and this happens everytime.. I have calculated With Samsung watch and it gives around 1500 steps count for complete day but this band gives 2000+ steps for 2-3 hours for my daily in house routine.,2
Call recorder is not working.. i tried other call recorders also.. same issue..,2
"Reviewing After using 4 months , now it‚Äôs not working properly, automatically getting disconnected while on the call .",2
"1.its very stiff and HARD
2.cant wear it more than 5 minutes .
3.sound quality is pretty average .
4.a waste of money.",2
After one month of usuage I found the product is not up to the price we paid. Speed in good however the range is seriously worst. I stay in 1050sq house and my router placed in living room at entrance. I get week Signal at master bedroom when using @ 5Ghz but three tower for 2.4Ghz. I was expecting better from TP link for this price. Even I tried all possibilities to align the router for good signal but all effort went vein.... So pls think twice and read other reviews before you buy this product.,2
I have been using my old tp link router for past 5 years and after that i ordered this but Not satisfied with overall experience ! Just don't expect too much if your upgrading from your basic properly working wifi router.,2
"First paper will not get straight,it has lot of error,ink get half exhausted after 4 th colour print. I didn't like the product ..
Not a value for money..",2
Dislike and home prudeact,2
The overall accuracy is not good screen refresh rate is not good in rupees 5000 it's not a value for money accuracy is literally not good disappointed by the sword but in looks 5 star some features very good some not good overall I want to say that it's good but not value for money.,2
Battery drain within 3 to 4 hours after usage for videos. Also screen touch doesn't works at left upper corner,2
It's a damaged piece. Can only hear the sound. Speaker doesn't works.,2
"I returned this the third day after delivery.
It hanged in my very first use LOL !
‚Ä¢Camera is below average.
‚Ä¢Processes is average.
‚Ä¢It does not have fingerprint reader.

"Overall okay, but a lot of glitches.. sleep monitoring is not so accurate as I sleep in the afternoon as well.. battery life is 5-6 days woth normal use.. spo2 is not accurate so don't count on it..

Battery life is average, it is very slow Device from 1st day I purchased, Sometimes hangs for hours.
I request you don't buy this.",2
"Not satisfied.250 should be the price..treble is very high,childish sound.but after doing some settings in equalizer,and tuning in samsungs adapt sound settings you can get better sound. But by default settings these are not good for listning music..+ you've to presss them to hard in ear to listne bass.",2
Range is so so..tenda 150 gIves nearly same range..go for other branded n300 series as per me..,2
too bad camera.,2
"I bought a headphones before it for 800rs . When I lost that I bought it for same quality expectations. It's cheaper than that but it was discounted price so I expect for same quality but it's not upto mark .
It's an average headphone.
Find something better and tell me pls.",2
"Mobile is gud according to battery nd performance
Bt camera quality is not upto the mark
I received mobile without charger",2
Speed performance and quality is very poor. Not expected. Customer care says can't take return. Will have to resell it in online.,2
This was my 3rd MI phone but now it will be the last. I bought this phone for my school work during lockdown. But I am highly disappointed. Especially due to the unwanted MI apps that not only eat space but are also irritating. Cleaning the storage is such a complicated task. I have now used this phone for 6 months and can confirm that the performance is pathetic. Constant software reboot required.,2
"Fingerprint sensor not so fast.
Battery poor.
Camera quality in night blur picture.",2
Camera quality is not good....and phone performance is also bad.,2
Not much good phone,2
"Redmi 9 view no bright, photo picture is not clear money waste.",2
Packing and accessories are excellent but phone is toooo slow,2
Nice product! But if you are using this while resting the connector will start to tore in less than 2 weeks and eventually the earphones will stop working s I don't really recommend this product.,2
There is a.fundamental defect in this NFL Printer. Also there is no way to check out the print A OR to delete a file from printing It's speed is just one a day. So it's not worth the money.,2
the microphone of this headset was not working the entire microphone cable was not working,2
I wil not recommend anyone to buy this product because it feels uneasy to wear it for long hours. It also does not has a comfortable foam of the ears.,2
Okay.. product,2
"Bought this router UPS during Jan 2019, was working fine all the while but stopped working in March 2020 for no reason.",2
"The product is not good, and when I see any image then it shows red and green images. I want to return to this mobile.",2
Connectivity settings are really worst,2
The tech support of TP-Link is worst. Push notifications are not delivered whenever I connect to my WiFi network. TP-Link was not able to help me with this issue. They cut the call twice after guiding with modifications in settings that didn't work. I sent an e-mail to them. But they neither replied nor called me to assist me in fixing the issue. I was still in the return window when this issue appeared. But I didn't return it because I don't like the seller to bear losses because of the defective product manufactured by TP-Link.,2
Charging üîã very slow category,2
"Best budget 4k @60Hz display for gaming(4k alert, RTX2080TI recommended), moderate lvl creativity(99% sRGB only) and HDR(entry level, but still very bright +350 nits, eyes strain alert). I was really doubtful about Indian stock quality after reading so many negative reviews. But I received a perfect screen with no back light bleed(as it should be). Although IPS glow(which is normal for IPS panels) is there and you might notice that in a dark room with a dark scene/image. But definitely not a deal breaker considering the selling price.

Update: Display showing image retention issue. See pics. Selling lower quality monitors in India.",2
"1. Headband plastic has broken only after 3 months of use.

2. During summers, it becomes very sweaty in the earcups.

Apart from that everything is fine in this pair of headphones.",2
"Some notifications not not show in band 4.
Price high and performance down.
Heart rate doesn't show accurate.",2
It is a average product,2
Mike didn't work,2
"Please don't waste your money on this phone, I got attracted to the exchange offer as they are offering a higher discount. But looks like it's just a marketing trick.. they rejected the exchange offer at the time of delivery.. my phone had no scratches, no dents, no cracks, by citing some minor issues.. and I had to pay the balance amount to take the delivery.

At this price point, there are many other phones/variants in the market with better features. The Display is not good at all with only HD+ whereas there are many phones in the market which are half the price with FHD+ feature. You can very well compare all the icons and graphics are pixilated.
Moreover, only SIM1 is 5G, SIM2 is limited to 4G, no dedicated MicroSD slot.. its a hybrid sim slot.",2
Camera quality is not up to the mark.,2

Clarity is not that much good.,2

"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 100 to 40% battery drain in just 2 days. Won't last 4 days.
The watch would randomly disconnect from the phone displaying Bluetooth icon briefly, even while the watch is within a feet distance from phone. Happens very frequently !
Once you unpair, pairing the watch again is a challenge. The app says pairing successful but the watch remains stuck in the QR scan screen

Regarding wrist sense, it is slow. You will have to stare at the black screen waiting to be turned on. Though it is a 1 or 2 second slow, but it is noticeably slow and it is kind of annoying

NoiseFit App needs a lot of polishing. Fitness data are not syncing and getting lost frequently. It only remembers step count of previous days. Heart rate, SpO2 readings are lost after unpair / pair.

Hardly 40 watch faces as of now and not ""Plethora"" as claimed and all of them are dull and very similar to each other. Takes long time to apply face. Only 1 customizable watch face and that too just background.

Music Control is very boring. Doesn't display title/artist etc. Just the same screen.

Noise need to fix the connection issues, pairing issues, fitness data synchronization, polish the Noisefit app and improve the UX of the watch.

Summary, ColorFit Pro 3 needs to be better than Amazefit Bip U to be successful. But sadly it isn't except for bigger display.",2

"Good Things:
1.Big display.(but sleep time was not shown in the device)
2. Shows time Correctly
3. SPO2 is also good.
4.Exercise tracking
5.takes all your input parameters, age, weight ..etc
6. Battery life 5 days, after that it need charging (i am using this band almost from last 20 days)

Bad Things:
Sleep tracker : (non interactive, non readable graphs are shown in the app, you need to type your sleep data manually...that's the app...worst and useless)....just see any mi, honor bands sleep data analysis, and its graphs...they are awesome.
Sleep time is not shown in the band, for this you need to use your phone's app.
Sleep time in App is completely in accurate....It always gives a random number in between 2 - 3 hours (i.e
some random number.) You will not get any detailed analysis...
Sleep time will be measured, once per day (suppose you sleep at 9PM, and woke up at 10PM) -- it will be sleep time for that day...even after you sleep also...it will not counted and not shown.

overall :UTTERLY USELESS FOR SLEEP monitoring.

Steps Count: Giving wrong data
For every 10 steps of yours, it counts as 1.

Blood Pressure Monitoring:
It always gives you a normal range, even if the person has high BP. (takes approx10 minutes to give the data)
Not recommended for BP purpose.

i bought it with lots of expectations, But it didn't met even 10% of those. I switched back to my honor band, felt 100 times better than this(i prefer sleep time monitoring). (My advise, other than this band, go for any brand product which you like)",2
Affordable bluetooth headphones with fair battery usage. Not suitable for NC and bass.,2
"It has a connectivity issues.
It has charging issue.
Not worth in this price range",2

Battery is good

Refresh rate is true is words only.

Light weight",2
"Very disappointed by receiving a very flimsy and fragile looking JBL earphones.

Better buy from official website as it looks like JBL will manufacture different SKU for them and for online sellers. Looks at the placement of mic in both C100SI.
Even while registering for warranty, there are 3 different type of SKU.
This one has very thin wires, mic on the right earphone wire. I hope it lasts, previous two also didn't go for more than 1.5 years.
Bass is lesser but that is know for this model by design. Disappointed about such wrong selling.",2
"Sometimes i feel good about it, sometimes i am not. Scanner quality is great, can be used for scanning documents or old photos as well. Print quality is great, but best for photo. Pages per cartridge is 50 for b/w and 10 for color prints.
Few things that makes me unhappy is that some times it gives print or copy in very small aspect ratio, i dont know why. Seems like a firmware issue.
Pages stucks sometimes while printing like 1/20 times. In scanning, it sometimes scans upside down like 2/5 times.
Cartridge purchase is worst, business model is so unethical that you have to pay 1200 for color cartridge which print only 10 pages. And black cartridge cost 800 which is able to print only 50 pages. Printing in home becomes super expensive.",2
its not working properly and kindly replace it as its in warranty . kindly replace it or exchange it . waiting for your earliest response,2
"Hello, MI smart band 4 is only good for watching the time. Never gives accurate steps, heart rates and even distance. I tested it against Apple Watch and 2-3 mobile apps for tracking steps. It gives 1-2 less kilometer then other applications.",2

Very disappointed,2
Bluetooth keeps disconnecting every half an hour. I complained about this to noise customer support by sending email. They asked me to provide some additional details which was provided by me rite away. Thereafter there was no response from noise customer support. Extremely disappointed with the product and the customer support.,2
The signal is not covering above 6 meters of distance even in open area,2
"Steps counts go up even if you are travelling on bike, bus or car. So accuracy is the concern.",2

Great signal coverage. I used to get signal in any corner of the house. But then suddenly it stopped working. As shown in the video the lights went dull for some reason and the device stopped working. Trying to reach tech support, but in vain.",2
Print quality and other features ok but printing cost is high per copy 9 to 10 rs and ink jet cartridge not refueled.,2

Very bad in performance.....there is a heating problem...nd take restart...,2
I had brand loyalty for JBL. Buy it was all gone as both headphones have given really bad result. Both are not functioning properly. Don't advise to buy,2
Bad product. You will find different alternative. Don't go for this. Signal strength is really poor. I have used different brands this is really pathetic. Feeling cheated with positive reviews.,2
Ink cartridge always doing a problem. Always..,2
Cartage ink very high consumption,2
Not satisfied üòûüòû,2
Automatically disconnecting from audio wn plugged to mobile or system. The voic is visible to outside even they are plugged in.,2
Bought in October. Already there are lines on display. There was no physical damage. Touchscreen was decent. Display was well lit even in direct sun. Expected better quality from Noise. Pretty disappointed.,2
"Product looks nice but not worth it.. I have used MI band since 4 years and would like to see similar features with noisefit in terms of steps accuracy and sleep accuracy but highly disaaponted..

1) app needs to sync manually to record steps
2) sleep monitor doesn't look accurate.
3) heart rate count doent work if turned off automatically (this drains down battery fast)
4) device gets disconnect from app frequently.
5) Overall AI is okay not so great.

Recommendation -
Instead of buying NoiseFit watch buy Mi band 4 or 5 of same range..",2

The mobile seems to be renewed/returned one.The seal was tampered and found dust all over the display...Attached pics,2
Don't buy these. Didn't worth 600 or 700. Audio pinches in ear bad sound quality very less base and bad built quality. Very thin wires can be broken easily. You should go for realme buds 2 instead.,2

Abc,2
As good as single band router. 5ghz band has a very limited range if at all it works. Hence using only 2.4ghz band now. Should‚Äôve gone for single band router instead.,2
Quality of the product was not as expected they got shut down automatically just by using for 30 minutes I exchanged the product by the new one is also having same issue what a kind of service they are providing my time and money is wasted,2
"After 1 year the head of the earphone tore,then after fixing it 6 months later right side of the earphone stopped working. Needs a design makeover and quality of the wiring needs to be improved. Instead go for an earphone with a bend head so that you can use it in any position.",2
Indicator for scanning not visible. Placing of paper in the printer is not obvious.,2

Worst product. 1st I was facing problem with ping loss. Then it was replaced by service center. Now the hotspot is not working,2
"The Wi-fi signal strength is very poor, even in the same room, the signal shows only a couple of bars. Very disappointed with the product. Thought it would my receiver (laptop), but it is a brand new laptop from DELL with high-end configuration. Also a same signal issue with iPhone as well, this proves the product is overrated for nothing. I have very old router which give very good signal even in one floor down.",2
Very basic phone don't get fooled ... performance is very average or below average... The app icons comes so big ..feels like it's made for elderly people...no fast charging for a battery 4300 mah...very dissatisfied with the service from Amazon..there is no return policy as well..now stuck with this product ...,2
"It's a good phone with horrible software. Here are some fixes.

1. Ads - use Blockada to block all MIUI ads and trackers. This is free and does NOT require root. As a personal preference I also use the Nova Launcher to make the phone's UI look more polished and close to stock Android.

2. Phone recording - This is an absolutely stupid inconvenience that Xiaomi shoved into their phones which nobody asked for. This phone uses Goggle Dialer meaning you can NOT discreetly record all your calls and the phone will play an alert saying This call is being recorded'. In my opinion, this is the worst thing about this phone because it is unfixable without rooting it. Every other xiaomi phone lets you use the miui dialer with the built-in discreet automatic call recorder. NOT THIS ONE. I hate this and hope xiaomi fixes this with a software update.

3. Camera quality: It's not bad, it's actually pretty good for the price. But you can get way better photos by using the G-Cam APK. Google 'Gcam for Redmi 9 Power'. At the time of writing, the gcam port does not support video.

Other annoying things that can't be fixed via software:

1. Lack of LED light

2. Imbalanced speakers. The bottom speaker is way more powerful than the top, this makes the stereo effect super annoying, even though a lot of paid YouTubers would have touted it as a feature. It gets annoying unless you're holing it in a way that amplifies the top speaker. This can be mitigated a little by messing with the equalizer, but that sounds like too much work unless you're willing to mess with it every time you plug in your headphones.

3. My screen protector came pre-applied, but it was off-center. My eyes have gotten used to it, but that was a horrible first impression.

4. It's made by a Chinese company.

Positives:

1. Nice bang-for the buck.
2. Great in-hand feel
3. Long-lasting battery
4. Has IR blaster which is handy sometimes

Neutrals

1. The Redmi logo is big, but it's hardly visible. I can only see it under a specific light. Otherwise it's fine. I'd prefer if they were more classy about it along with being subtle.

I can't recommend this phone to most people because of the voice recording / google dailer mess. Otherwise this would have been a good phone. I don't regret buying it, but it doesn't make me happy that i bought it.",2
Looks and sound quality is good but sometimes connectivity get disrupted and now charging problem is also happens. Now headphone is now taking charge I don‚Äôt know what happened in it. And one more issue while talking over call calling sensor is not working. But wired connectivity is good.,2
Sound quality is worst and its for casual gaming like normal games. Don't buy for competitive and you can't wear it for more than 1 hour.,2
One side of headset is not working :( after two months,2
"Beautiful product with some flaws in execution.

I have browsed several reddit forums and samsung members community app only to find that issues around display are recurring in this device.

1. Ghost touches - this I didn't face. Some people had reported that screen takes touch inputs on its own.

2. Brightness banding - this is what happens when you are looking at a phone in a dark room (like I did before sleeping, scrolling through social media). If a background is grey, it is very uneven, with some portions of screen dimly lit and others brightly lit. It becomes very irritating since we use dark mode to conserve battery. Whatsapp looked brighter in the upper half, so did chrome when all tabs were closed and any grey/greyish tone for that matter didn't look perfect. What's worse is that samsung in India says this is a characteristic of the display and therefore, it cannot be repaired/replaced. I saw enough red flags and just returned it within 7 day window to get full refund. You can refer to the first pic, this is how my display was. Search on google - ""Samsung S20 FE banding"" to see more such cases.

3. Green tint - again related to grey background in a dark room with low brightness, where grey can look green. I have uploaded this, refer to 2nd image. Not my unit but someone received it with that issue.
Search on google - ""Samsung S20 FE Green Tint"" to see more such cases.

While the device offers a lot at such a compelling price, it's futile if faulty units in large quantities have been manufactured. Sours the user experience - samsung giving a snapdragon phone in India was the only reason I bought it, and now had to return an otherwise perfect device marred with display issues.",2
"If you're planning to buy noiseFit Endure I'll suggest you to go for MI Band 5, because watch has all features hardware wise( hart rate, spo2) but software wise it's not good say it's smartwatch.

1 ) You can't set alarm from watch ( only available through da fit app, not in the noiseFit app), even 300rs digital watch can set alarm

2 ) 24hrs hartrate monitor is a gimmick, you have to set time/interval for hartrate monitor in noiseFit app.

3 ) sleep Tracking only works at night, otherwise no use, no dashboard for sleep Tracking in watch.

4 ) poor notification management

5 ) weather updates are poor

6 ) not much options to call this watch smart.

7 ) Not possible to return, feels like scammed

Design wise it's good but software is meh.....

Go for Mi Band 5, trust me you won't regret.",2
Not so good as shown in video or in advertisement. Not satisfied with this watch. Mainly wrist movement display takes some second to show. Watch faces are common and boaring. I advise go to Amazon Fit beat it's better than Noise Colour fit pro. More upgradation is needed to manufacturer for success,2

3 USB doesn't work as cloud again it is issue with firmware (were we cannot update firmware)

I would suggest you guys to look for the better router like linksys, netgear or ASUS. I've always had problem with d'link.",2
Warranty shows left for 8 months only on Lenovo.So the 1 year warranty is a false claim.,2

As per customer experience not reached camera quality.,2
"The touch and feel of product is good but the notification is really sad, and the frequent disconnecting issue is too much, there is no alert of device getting disconnected even if it is in the vicinity of the phone and re connecting takes a lot of time.

Performance of the phone is as expected but I got damaged phone I got a replacement but it was again a damaged phone the product from this seller is not good,2
I am purchase same time JBL and boot earphone but after use one year JBL earphone have a J1 right side earphone not working properly and they have damage and whenever I use one side is not working properly in JBL product but as at the same boat earphone working a nice and good swan with sound quality boot is a good and JBL is not a good this product is not good,2

product is already opened...as u can see.... they cello tape it....not good....,2
As per my view Sound quality is very bad..By spending this amount in local market you can get a excellent headset.there is no bass at all..if you have some knowledge then you can enhance only some bass in equalizer in your mobile..thats it..You can't do anything more than that.,2
Very poor noise cancellation and sound quality.,2

"Edit1: adding on after using it for a few months, the call quality is terrible and microphone is also not working properly, Please look after other ones, waste of money
Though the battery life is great, the charge time is long. Don't buy it. The performance drop is so exaggerated. We can't switch between apps without waiting for 3 to 4 seconds minimum. Camera quality is bad as well.",2
"Connectivity between Watch and mobile is not showing continuously.

It's automatically disconnected after sometime.

Battery discharege with in 2 days. other wise it is good.,2
"After using one week my speaker is troubling
While calling opposite person voice only hearing
my voice is not hearing opposite person",2
"Pic 1 - Outdoor cycling - The path shown in the image is actually the opposite to the direction in which I performed the activity. Distance shown is lesser than actual distance covered. Even more, it actually started tracking distance after I'd already covered 2+ kms. (I already synced with Mi Fit App, Switched my GPS on, and locked the application).

Pic 2 - After waking up, going to cycling directly and coming back, it should have been maximum 150 steps. But it shows 850+. Also, just after waking up it shows some 100+ steps. (lol)

I am really disappointed with the product, even though it as some good pros like
- amazing battery life (after like 4-5 days it's on 82% charge)
- sleep tracking (the only thing which is nearly accurate)
- good touch sensitivity and display
- mi fit app is OK
- water resistance

Other cons -
- inaccurate heart rate
- inaccurate stress monitoring

The main selling point of any ""smart"" band/watch is the fitness features it provides. I don't want a good battery life or screen but provide me accurate informations. Inaccurate gps tracking, calorie tracking, steps tracking, heart rate tracking is enough for me to give it 2/5.",2
Really disliked the sync with app. It's a good looking watch but definitely not a smartwatch. It is so painful to connect watch to the app. Keep trying all day but just doesn't happen. One has to reset the watch every now and then and tey to connect. Thereafter too success is not guaranteed. And no way to connect with support to solve the matter,2
Got these Boat headphones on last week of July 2020. All was good till now. But suddenly started delivering cracking sound..since last 2 days. And now it's completely dead.,2
Build quality is very poor. The mechanism that held the charging port closed has a design fault where it never closed unless you press it like multiple times...and once closed it had to be opened with a pin...no other way however long nails you have. Sound quality when compared with similar products is average to below. Facing multiple disconnection issues with Smart TV and phone. Starts breaking up when on the edge of its connecting range and then abruptly disconnects and has to be restarted to get it paired again which worked fine initially but now it does this with all devices.,2
"Not good phone as very heavy in weight to carry. Battery drain very early, internet not working properly as signal is poor",2
"Well guys if you want a cheap product like I wanted please go for the same. You will get all decent features within your tracker including ""stress monitoring"" ""heart beat"" ""PAI"" ""multiple sports"" modes etc. but in terms of accuracy it lags. Frankly speaking I haven't used any other fitness tracker of any other brand so I can't say whether they are better performing in this range.

Now let me tell you where it lags
Sports Mode - in all the sports mode it has gives fairly correct details including steps calculation, however you are doing strength training in gym it fails to add anything towards counting of your steps.

Steps Calculator - well if you keep motion detection or activity detection all the time I don't know it counts your steps. Recently I was on a road trip by car we went through a bad patch of road for almost 2 hours and it calculated them as steps as if I am walking.

Sleep tracker - Well it's pretty decent but at times it is unable to differentiate whether I am sleeping or just lying on bed and timings of sleep on certain days are inaccurate. Additionally the MI fit app is no good as it hasn't improved much over the years.

Heart Beat - Well its accurate at times but at times I noticed during my strength training in gym when I am pretty sure that my heart beat is high it shows as normal.

Stress Monitoring - it's just a namesake feature and it can't accurately predict the mental stress you are going through

Touch Interface - very poor. At times it doesn't wakes up even after touching few times and at night if the screen gets accidental touches anywhere it just wakes up. Some kind of accidental touch feature should be there.

So guys please think before putting your money on this and please don't get lured to review videos on YouTube where they get paid for providing positive reviews.",2
"Bought this seeing the huge no. of 5 star reviews, but I doubt the authenticity of these reviews now, for these earphones are nothing more than average performers. The sound is so low even at max volume that it's practically impossible to make out what the other person is saying when on call.",2
"Literally go for an other headphone if you are going to use this for gaming. Mic quality is the worst. Instead of providing rgb which no one asked in a 800‚Çπ headset could have given a better mic.
pros
Comfort on this headset is good

Mic is very bad
Can connect to laptop",2
Smartwatch looked feeble for the price..no blood pressure measurement,2
not bad...,2

Not good product but its ok,2
"Installation was not easy even for the person whose living is earned by working with all such devices. Before he could show me how to print, curfew & lockdown have kept him away. There's no manual in hard copy to help me. Instead of messages from the printer such as ""no paper"" etc there are symbols & they're placed on top, not facing the user. Crippled as I am, not knowing what is showing on top because I'm sitting in front of the desk, not able to ask someone to tell me what symbol is lighted up, & even if they tell me, having no manual to guide me, the printer is unusable at present.
Online videos are focused on wireless use & using via phone. Nothing else seems to matter.
Because I hadn't found another printer that's not designed similarly, & this was all I could afford, I bought it. Now I'm sorry I did.",2
"I had purchased GOQii Smart Vital with lot of hope but has been disappointed primarily on two accounts. I have been using Fitbit for the last six years and have been very satisfied with the same even though the number of features are less than GOQii. You can see the 4 minutes time difference in the enclosed picture. . Second disappointment is inaccurate distance measurement. I am a regular walker and on both my hands I put on GOQii and Fitbit. I have consistently noted that if Fitbit shows 1 KM , the reading on GOQii is always around 0.85 KM. I had called up their Customer Care centre twice but nobody has bothered to give me a solution. I wanted to buy this for my other family members but I cancelled the idea. I have no complaint about BP, SPO2, heartbeat and other features.",2

Nice products but colling ficher missing,2
I didn't like it as the voice was too feeble and body felt cheap. It was the same even for the replacement. Amazon was kind enough to give a refund.,2
I have a house of 1000 sqft and it does not cover even the half of the house call is yours..you may can switch to F6,2

"The name itself says it a brand but the worst part is about this earphone is that they are providing earphones with a low cost according to them but they should give the material as well.

Let's talk about JBL C50HI

I bought it on April I was using normally but after 2 month's it's started showing issue
For example,

While taking calls with this earphone the voice which will come from other is very noisy, after plug out again plug in sometime it's working sometime not working.

Finally,

The right side of the earphone is not working as well as mic

After calling so many times to customer care they are telling to bring that product with invoice to their store.

Worst experience this time",2
After using this for close to 6months i can say that it works only half of the time ... I am using this with Airtel modem.,2
Most wrost item.... Dont buy it..... Its only a timepass lap.. Only for music and vdeos.. Not for work... Thnq,2
Not recommend for this product. Sound quality not good & not working sometimes..,2
The sound quality is not good. ordinary,2
"The earphones are not the same as they appear on Amazon. Made of very poor quality material. The microphone and control button are given in the right side while its video has a button and mic in the middle main wire. amazon is selling its copy. Do not buy from amazon at all, it will be a good choice to buy from jbl's official site.",2
"Sound was ok. Wire was very weak. Last i used C500I as compared to that, this product is of no good.",2
"Neither recieved bill online either offline... i dont know why ???
Know i am having sound problem...and connectivity issue not worthy.",2
I hate this perodect,2
"The earphones are no doubt very good but I did not get any earpieces along with this. Moreover the left ear piece and right were of different size. The product says that it gives a variation of 3 sizes of earpiece, I didn't recieve anything except the one that was already on the earphones.",2
Bluetooth connection is so bad,2
"Thankfully the charger works, unlike most of the poor reviews that warned about charging problems. I bought one device for me and one for my wife. Both give accurate time, show the day of the week and date, has an accurately functioning stopwatch and timer. Well, that should have been enough if it was sold just as a watch. But its a smart fitness band and our expectations are higher. And thats where it falls short. The step count and distance tracker in my wifes watch is totally inaccurate. On our daily walks together, her distance and step counts are way less than what my band records. And I have cross checked with Google maps the distance that we walked, which corroborates the distance recorded on my Smart Band. So I guess we got one faulty piece of the two that we ordered.",2
Not a good quality,2
"I bought system in dec 2019 and now its not working. i called to Phillips center rohini they said not repairing Music sustems

plz suggest where should i go",2
"Disappointing. Step count and heart rate is not accurate. Mi band 3 is doing better job.

Continuous heart rate enabled with 5 mins frequency. It shows 50, 60 at times. I am not an athlete.

If I do 20 situps, it counts 40 steps :(..why???

Measure manual heart rate. It says , dont move your hand. That's ok when I manually check heart rate. But when you go for outdoor walking, you will be moving your hand faster, how it calculates the heart rate then?

Just sit in a place. Turn on manual heart rate. Sensor will glow. You just move your hands up down little faster. It shows my heart rate is 120 and I am doing fat burn. Nonsense.

Call alerts and message notifications not working properly. Huami into this business for a decent period of time. I wonder why they are not able to get basic stuff like call alerts and steps count accurate!!

Display and lookwise it is fantastic.

If you are fitness conscious, then look somewhere else.
If you just want to show off, then you can go for it

Lot to improve!!",2
Sound quality is not good.,2
"Lot of bugs and it does not work properly with App,BP, SPO2 measurements are wrong, the seller should fixe it or allow buyer to return it.",2

idle time for sitting long time is pathetic it will alert you even though you are standing n there is some activity going on.
Sleep tracking I woke up during sleep many times but it will not get capture and even after woke up it will keep recording as sleep time.
Apart from the main content the other features are good like notification and heart rate pretty much accurate.",2

"Below are some point that you should consider before you but

1) Camera has huge issue with SD Cards, it simply don't work with SD card more than 32GB. because it only support FAT32 file system. If you inset 64GB or more SDcard it will corrupt it.

2)No NAS support (Network attached storage), if you want to view recording in PC, you have to remove SD card from camera and insert into Laptop. and when you insert again in Cam it get malfunction.

3) It doesn't support low light color mode.

4) Once you attached the wall mount support into cam, it become impossible to remove it. make sure you fix the mount to Wall first and then attached the cam.

5) App layout is good and responsive.

6) It has RTSP protocol, which is good to watch live feed in PC via VLC or other media.
these are the big difference when compared to other IP cam in market

7) Camera microphone is sensitive, can capture low voice as well. But Camera Speaker is not good, Output sound is very low.",2

"I will not go much into specifications but this model 12v version 2 contains 3 x 2000 mah battery. Ie total capacity of this product is 6000mah. Price is around 1990 INR which is way costly for the thing it provides.

"I bought this band in January and writing review after using it for 45 days approximately.
Points which I specially like to mention:
a. If you are walking having your hand in pocket then it won't count the accurate steps.
b. Even if you are not walking just shaking the band or moving the arm like pendulum it will count your steps, instead it should sync with hearrate and on that basis it should count the steps.
c. If you are having sleep during noon time then it won't track your sleep tracking, as it is designed to track sleep hours during night time.
d. I started behavior tagging in phone app and played badminton 2 times but it didn't record the stats both the time and there was error.
e. Charging it after removing it from band as well is not in its favor.",2

Connecting with wifi not a easy task, troubleshooting comes often, printing waiting time is too much, I witnessed very strange thing and I believe nobody talked about in Amazon comments section, canon app doesn't support word or Excel file to get a print though your mobile phone (android/iOS) but yes same can be printed from the laptop. Customer care service is pathetic they even don't know which application to be downloaded for print they are useless and not able to give a solution at all totally waste of time. I think made a mistake and purchased canon ink toner, I think HP printers will be a better call, I have experienced HP printers in the past with better features, seemless wifi, customer experience is good. Not Happy with my decision. Its your hardmoney take a cautious call while purchasing.",2

Also the ear piece is making too much noise",2
Connectivity issue on the product,2
the headphone when first arrived were pretty decent in the price range. incidentally with usage one of the earphones started losing its sound to virtually non-functional now. Possibly a defective piece. Placing a return/ replace request since the makers promise a year guarantee.,2
slow hai and ink bhi jaldi khatam ho jati hai,2
The mouth piece is too far from the mouth and hence the other person cannot hear you when you are speaking at normal volume . You have to talk lil louder for the other person to hear,2
"its good but not working like mi router
so think before buying this router",2
The sound quality is not as good as compared to sennheiser cx180. As most of the user mention in their comments. Good but nor best neither better. I shall go to sennheiser again.,2

"I'm someone who uses earphones with utmost care (I have a storage pouch for it, my previous earphones have lasted for years together, etc)
Even for me, the material wasn't durable. The junction point between the audio jack and the wire started breaking in less than 6 months. In the next 2-3 months I could see the metal wires though it..and in less than 1 hour one of the earpieces stopped functioning, soon followed by the second. And since the ""damage was physical first and later technical"", it wasn't covered under warranty.
It's really embarrassing for a huge company like JBL. I pay 800 bucks for nothing.",2
Sound is loud but not thumping bass effect,2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Seems to be Quality Control Issue or refurbished product sent by Appario Retail. Didn't expect this from Sony and Amazon.
On unboxing and testing the home theatre, surround right speaker was found to be defective. It was not outputting any sound and when the unit was shaken, something was wobbling inside making noise (Video Attached). Waiting for replacement from Amazon now...

Apart from that, this is my initial review, there are no tweeters in this system and you'll feel that high frequencies are little low in this system. Adding to that, there is no equaliser option to crank high frequencies up, you are stuck with some presets which don't help that much. If you have equaliser in audio source device, you can adjust the high frequencies to get a balanced output out of this system.",2
even four hours battery backup also not there very much disappointed with this,2
"Yes, this SMART watch will show you standing even you are walking on the treadmill at the speed of 6Kmph, why bcz you have hold your hand still for 2 sec or so, isn't it smart. So, whole tracking thing is based on your hand movement, if you are standing still and waving your hand like walking it will show you are walking, great.
If the censer area will become wet due to water or sweat, it wonk show correct reading, like it will show your heart is resting while you are running on the treadmill if your hand is wet, now you can imagine how often your hand will be wet.
So, after seeing all these smartness I really believe that what other things claimed by company for this device will be very true, you should experience this if spending Rs.2400/- does not bother you at all. Good Luck.",2
Although the product is good and having good quality of sound but the built wuality sucks this product. Built quality is very poor. I suggest you to go for boat rockerz 400.,2

"Sound quality is very good, you can increase decrease Bass. But the bluetooth keeps on disconnecting. One of the speaker also does not work at times, so I have to restart the speakers to connect bluetooth and make all speakers work. Not raising a complain because of Corona, but expected better quality from Phillips.",2
"Using it for more than a year now. This earphone is working fine but still I had to order a new earphone today (another company) as I got tired of extremely low level of volume output.. Sound quality and performance is great, but even if you keep volume to maximum (both for device and streaming platform), the output is terrible.. I use it for prime, hotstar, laptop movies etc. and faces the same issue most of the time.. and yes I dont have any hearing problem, I am using another earphone too which has way better output.. If you want to use it for watching movies or for songs, please buy something else, otherwise it will just spoil your music experience..",2

I mean they only use whatsapp and youtube for videos but I installed a game today and played for 15 mins or so... And that's when I noticed that the battery life is pretty awful. 1% declined every 2mins or so and that was just a card game so I'm not sure what else to expect. So it may seem good for them as I said earlier but if you were to ask me then well that's a lame phone, I would rather buy something else",2
"Not saying it's completely waste, i trust hp for laptops from years, as i have 2 already at home. But particularly this model performance is below par considering the specifications, should've gone for Intel processor rather than amd. *lags too much, high end softwares like autocad, sketch, coral draw, photoshop isn't compatible or recommended for this variant, it sucks!

This phone has heating problem. It is even after April-21 software update. Clicking the pictures has been an issues for now. I have tried almost multiple times at different times be it morning or night you can feel the phone getting heated a lot. 10 mins of operations today and the screen was unable capture any further and gave warning mgs. The heat was such that you will have a question about this phone is it a phone or an iron? The camera gets shut post that and you will ruin all the moments being able to capture. It taken very long time to comeback to normal (15 to 20mis). It a Ultra Premium Phone and Its a completely waste of money and hardware. Infact none of the so called reviewers did mention about this issue.
This has been a very big disappointment and I feel I was cheated buying this ""Premium flagship Phone"". I am truly thinking about my dissision of buying. This phone is not worthy of a 1 lakhs rupees tag. Feeling hopeless with this phone now. I wish I could have a different phone...",2
"Amazon has lost its trustworthyness, nowadays. They are cheating the trusted customers. This mobile is not worthy for its price and it is a basic one. When trying to return on buying a new version, customer is denied of this facility on some flimsy grounds.",2
2 speaker not working,2
Not upto mark performance,2
"Display - Amoled screen is bright and crystal clear like samsung phone screen.
Aesthetics - Nice fit in ur hands with a classy look
Durability- long lasting capsule and Band
Accuracy - Call notifications are always with a lag. Some times when u cancel the call the notifications start coming which is annoying.
Price - Value 4 Money
If ur a 1st timer in this, then buy it without any doubts.
P.S. the actual screen is much lesser than the visible screen.
Certainly an huge improvement on Band 3...",2
"Dislike ... Camera very poor .
Bettry life average..
MOBILE HANG PROBLEM..
ALL OTHER AVERAGE",2
"I bought this router to use it with my BSNL telephone connection. but due to bad network and lack of faster bandwidth plan i had to change my ISP. This router turned out useless when tried to use it with WAN input. This even cannot be repurposed as WiFi extender/repeater.

Pros:
Good Range which is expected at this price-point.

Cons:
1. This router cannot be repurposed with WAN input, it works only with ADSL connection. If in future if you decide to move WAN based connection, you will have buy new router.
Even firmware upgrade wont help you as this is hardware limitation.
The other model TD-W8961ND have the WAN input but it is even costlier.
2. To my surprise, this tp link router even dont have repeater/WiFi extender mode at this cost.
but you can use it to extent range with wired connection (which is complicated).
3. Router configuration is bit complicated than usual DLink routers.

Expensive doesn't always mean better features!",2
"Mobile is good at its price but the camera quality isn't good as shown in Description,
In comparison between redmi 4 and redmi 9 13MP rear camera redmi 4 is good.
Zooming quality isn't good.
And battery draining too fast .
At last not satisfied with product.",2
"Please don't go with the review here. I think most of the good reviews are coz of free vouchers u get once u sent a screenshot of review. This watch fails surface test, alerts stop randomly. vibration intensity is too low, and there is no option to increase. Had been using Mi watch and so I know the difference. Atleast after paying around 4k expected to be better than MI. I went for this coz of screensize.. but functioning wise I did not like it",2
Print is coming like a faded one.. the color letters or images came with very lightly coated type. Easy to install.,2
"Not that good as claimed by others.
Pros:
Ink tank
Cheap ink
Easy installation

Cons:
Print quality is not good, not better than laser printer.
Printing Scanned documents are big hassle. It will stop printer half way through.
Body is very fragile. Very cheap plastic.
Mobile application is useless you cannot print manual duplex from mobile printing.
WiFi sometimes stop working. I called canon they said there is no big deal about it.",2
Not at all recommended .. In 3 months it will stop working,2
Sound quality is very poor for calling.we can not speak on call with this headset.Noise cancellation is very poor.Think before buying it if u are buying for calling purpose.,2
"I have Huawei 12V2A router. RouterUPS stopped working after just a week. Router is powered via this device, but there is 0 backup.",2
"Bad printer ,electricity not available all part and 10 days ,very bad",2
Bakvas sounds system worst money,2
Not stable. Doesn't work with most of the vendor's connections.,2
Ink consumption is very poor. If you are planning to take this you should buy 2/3 extra cartage for back up.,2
High printing cost,2
"High treble, bass not as said, poor sound quality. You will have hard time to make out lyrics from music. Sound of instruments can be heard more. If you are someone who loves decent sound experience don't buy. Only good thing is it is cheap with mic.",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Not bad ok OK",2
I ordered this earphone and after some time the left one was stopped working suddenly . I hate this thing I have stretched it nor I used it roughly,2
"The Picture quality is great but the PIP function works only with single input device. It dosent works with 2 Inputs at one go i.e. You cant see movie on PIP while working on Computer???
Highly disappointed with the Specifications mentioned here as well as on LG website. Its misrepresentation by the company.",2
Battery back up is not as par tbey have mentioned. It is giving me 15 days battery when connected to Mobile for messages and calling. Overall it is good,2
Sound quality is average. Mic is really good. But the buds are very hard. It really starts hurting after 15-20 mins of use. Don't go for this.,2
This camera auto focus very bad and picture quality bad and this camera battery backup so bad,2
Ink finish in 15 print page,2
Bluetooth is not working .Buttons of media are also not working,2
It is difficult to set up. Have to call Internet Service provider as it does not provide DCPH connection option. Have to set up connection for Alliance Broadband using Static IP,2
Bass is low....rest is avarage,2
The steps stopped counting after one month from the date of purchase. Tiresome customer care. No replacement initiated. Think before you buy,2
May be good but not best opt.,2
No watchfaces available. Only 4 or 5 inbuilt. U can download without money.,2
"I felt happy with the product. But the band is not fitting in inside the charging port st all. The clips won't work and it always falls out. Also since the cable don't have enough length, it is hard to charge the band. Worse designing. Everything else looks perfect for me.",2
Product is not good Technically problem this product,2
Touch issues ...multiple clicks for selection ...horrable display,2
"Software needs so much work , will change review if I actually see updates. Try buying fast track or fitbit rather , this piece has a literal inaccuracy for steps and distance of 0.3%/km of travel , Blood pressure doesn't work but I didn't even expect it to. SpO2 and HR are the only sensor that works accurately. Apart from that the watch loses BT connection with the mobile ( OP7 ) pretty often , there are no automatic syncs . Also please simplify the app it looks like a cluster of things that don't work ! Your model of goqii points looks good on paper but its terrible ( Even sweatpoints failed as a company )
If you need accurate health monitoring watches , I'd suggest look for something else. I bought this for make in India but the darn thing is literally made and assembled in China. Please review this goqii , if u want data comparisons email me , but resolve this junk of data.
Again will change this review if I see software upgrades to make atleast step and distance tracking accurate",2
"Mine came with a technical defect, it automatically disconnects from my phone if I don't play anything for 10sec.it is not comfortable as well. I would suggest not to choose to buy this product.",2
I am very much disappointed with the product because within one month one side of the earphone stopped working...,2
"Call quality is very bad. Voice fumbling and breaks after few minutes. Other person stops hearing your voice. Also, they can hear the noise around you. It's only good for music.",2
Money worst,2
"For 1000Rs this is a good router. Have used this router for more than 3 yrs. And I had 100mbps plan. But this router won't give you speed more than 15-20 Mbps if 4,5 devices are connected. Information on box about this router is misleading.

Don't waste money on this.., instead spend 1000 bucks more and get a gigabit router.",2
Mobile can't read memory card and contact's photo option is not available,2
Stopped working after a week.,2
Sound is good but the remote is 3rd class not responding.,2
"I requested for product replacement as soon as I listened to a song using this headphone. The bass quality is not good. Treble is way more than the base which I don't like at all. My old headphone is way better than this one maybe it's because they are of same brand and so they're more compatible with eachother but whatever the case I'm replacing this item to order the previous headphone.

And also if the headphone jack is slid even a little bit a disturbance noise appears which is another issue.",2
It was good before but few days ago it stopped working and I'm not able to listen anything from it. So I want to claim my warranty that was for 1 year.,2
Bulky big size.. Range not satisfactory.. Connectivity problems. Have to restart again and again to get connection..,2
Product not compatible with all HDMI versions. The screen always stays in tilted position. Max resolution is 720p,2
"Very disappointed with the strength it provides is not sufficient for 5~7 meter distance as well...
Many times strength is fluctuating for same distance. Crosschecked without router (direct LAN) ; works fine...
I suggest Should rethink before purchase....",2

Good printer but slowly printing,2
It's basically depends how original product you receive from Amazon....i would recommend you to buy it from it's website otherwise there are many duplicate products 9n Amazon ready to surve you...4 star is just for the original product,2
"No doubt this MI Band 4 is very good but i returned it just because of its charger as it doesn't fit properly with the Band. Although i am having previous model also MI Band 3 and its charger fitting is good. Don't know why Xiaomi has changed the charger model which is unable to fit, hence very tough to charge this Band.",2
Good working great for somedays but from the fewdays i m having some issues that if i connect wifi to my laptop automatically mobile wifi disconnects and vice versa.,2
"Not at all for clear calls. There is a constant background noise when I am speaking.
It is good for listening music and stuff but one cannot communicate over this. Very bad mic.",2
Normal don't expect more only only,2
"Ink is very low in quantities
You can only 40-50 pages only",2
"This is worst product from Samsung. Under 10k we can move to vivo, oppo, or redmi brands wisely. Camera quality is very very poor. After taking photo we see broken pixels and the worst picture. 48MP true camera is only for mouth speech really it is very worst one. Mobile become heat while charging alone. Very much disappointed. Not worthy for money. Don't buy this product.",2
"1. ABNORMAL MACHINE RUNNING NOISE WHILE COPYING / PRINTING DOCUMENT
2. CD RECEIVED WITH PRODUCT IS NOT WORKING, DRIVERS DOWNLOADED FROM NET.

Don't be fooled this mobile isn't what they are showing!! Battery isn't 5000 mah coz it hardly works only for one day...camera quality is not that good specially of front camera!!,2
"After a usage of 1 week here is my review
Pros-
Good battery life -the battery life is AWESOME I charged it when it arrived and it yet has 30 percent battery
Colour display-a bright color display and works nicely in harsh sunlight
Unlimited watch faces-i love the fact that it has unlimited watch faces

Cons
Inaccurate-one of the major reasons i did not like it.its inaccurate i sat in a bus and it added 3000 steps.i could increase my steps by moving my hand.sleep tacing is also in accurate i selpt for 8hrs but it showed only 6 hrs.heart rate is even worse.i removed my band and started heart rate and it showed 75bpm!!!.dont buy this band if u want an accurate fitness band

Final verdict-
It is a good band if u want features such as music control watch face customisation and notification alert.but if u want an accurate fitness band then it is not the way to go",2
"As called out in multiple reviews this product is not long-lasting. Mine stopped working in exactly 22 months. With a lack of options had no choice but to make a purchase again in this current WFH situation. I will not recommend this product in case you are able to find an alternative in the market.

Works while it lasts but over-priced and of low quality. Gross wastage of resources and more harmful to the environment in long run.",2
"Randomly stops, some people say its due to heating not sure, but all the lights would light up and it would just hang and nothing will connect to it until restarted",2
The speakers are not good. People can barely hear what I'm saying while using these,2
I couldn't connect it with bluetooth. Please guide.,2
"Overall the band is good but giving it 2 stars instead of 4 becoz it does not have the most basic feature which every electronic item (whether TV, laptop, iPad, phone, microwave etc) should have - option to turn off the device when not in use! The only way for the device to turn off is when it's battery reaches 0%! Its pathetic to not give a switch off/power off option!",2
I expected very much from these ear phones..but they dint reach my expectations...bass is not at all good...my 100rs ear phones are providing better bass than these...just a big brand and nothing else...disappointed..,2
Not of much good quality. They are really delicate. The songs are playing well only at certain angle,2
Such a very worst experience. Phone is getting hang after few minutes. No sound while talking via webex. Worst quality.,2
Very bad don't buy,2
"Battery Performance is very Bad.
Hardly works 7 Days since 100 percentage charging.",2
WiFi signal is disconnecting frequently and every time need to restart the router. That's really creates a lot of disturbance in middle of browsing or usage of WiFi.,2
"I am not received printer's CD in the Printer .
Kindly arrange the same.
Otherwise i will cancelled the order.
I hope you will consider my case.

Thanking You.",2
very slow speed with good to use as Hub. Not fit to my expectation.,2
"Not worthy for the money.
The product not met the expectations
Poor display quality and touch resolution
Amazon did a great job in 1 time exception of return policy.",2
The product is OK but remote has broken,2
Not showing accurate information. Better to go with another brand,2
Its speakers are not working. I will change the review of LG or Amazon help me on it.,2
Gives erratic measurements. Even the step counter is wrong too. I have stopped using this watch after 15 days. Waste of money,2
"Low Quality mobile...Don't buy

1).Sometimes Touch not work
2).Camera Quality is Average
3).Many adds are coming
4).App icon size are large
5).Does not moving files to sd card

"This product is really too below in sound quality. Very low bass, very low sound. Instead I bought MI bluetooth headset in same price and its quality and sound is superb than this!",2
One ear plug lost sound within 6 months.,2
"Sound quality not equal to same model same product.
Amazon product & Sony showroom same product sound quality different.",2
"I got a used product. I could not login to the router by the default admin password. It was clear someone changed it. Also, the SSID had a different name and I could not connect. I had to final do a hard reset of the router to connect to it.",2
"I have been using it for 2 months. Note down the Pros and Cons.

Cons:
1. Problematic in syncing with App. (Even the tiny Airdopes does it flawlessly)
2. Inaccurate distances. Someone advised to increase the height to get accurate distance but no use (added 6 Cms).
3. No GPS link with mobile app to measure the distance
4. When you put into exercise mode, alarm won't work and matter of fact you can't do anything without stopping the exercise mode. (Taking us 2 decade back OS)
5. SpO2 takes ages to close sometimes esp. early morning when you do first time.
6. While analysing SpO2, it disappears half of the way sometimes.
7. Measuring BP is waste. It just change the number as per your setting.
8. The strap lock is so delicate, it parted away on very first attempt.

Seems to be a out dated OS and material. (China OS & material?)

Pros:
1. It holds the charge for 6 days as promised
2. Just a fun to wear

For 6K, we expect something better wearable.",2
"Battery drains away, in 4 days
It's given as 10 days
And it's non returnable",2

Its been 8months since i purchased and the headphones one earpiece is not working.,2

Not support multi SSID.
No bandwidth control.",2

"This phone battery is superb but other specifications and performance is below average. And mainly we have to check the whole box and phone carefully , the I think Darshita Aashiana Pvt Ltd is selling some some diffect peices/refurbished phones. I was got refurbished phone even I ordered for a new one. So please check carefully after received your order.",2

The earphones are having a hissing sound now. After using it for 10 days or so i can not even replace or send them back.,2
Broken printer scanner,2
"SHOWING TWO ANTENNA BUT RANGE IS LOW, NOT RECOMMENDABLE",2
Sleep tracking is not very accurate. Once I get up for 5 mins and sleep again.. it wouldn't track. The step counter is also completely wrong. Doesn't track the steps properly. The touch is good but overall not a worthy product,2
"I have m01 with 1gb 16 gb veriant...

I recently bought the MI band 4 and it dramatically miscalculates the steps taken! I was riding on a two wheeler and it counted almost 650+ steps. I cannot just figure it out how does it even do that.,2
"No deep bass as they claimed.
Replacement requested and got new one.
The same problem persists on the new one.
If you are a bass lover don‚Äôt opt this.
If you need to enjoy the depth of music you can consider but still lot of other products are good camparitively.
My suggestion is don‚Äôt buy this for both call purpose and listening music.",2
"Signal drops at times, initially it use to work fine. Post warranty issues are there.",2
As per uses of 5 months PTron bluetooth base and sound is good but noise cancelation problem is very high. Very disturbance facing on the calls. Product quality is not as expected.,2
"Not happy with this purchase. Within a couple of weeks of the purchase, sound has stopped coming from one of the earphones. I was not happy with the fitment of the earbuds as well. Unable to replace or return, as the date for the replacement elapsed just a day earlier. I actually wanted to return it from day one, as I was not happy with the product even then, but the return option was not available.",2
"I bought it in September-20 , it‚Äôs not working now. Though there‚Äôs a 1 Yr warranty, I don‚Äôt know how to go about registering a complaint for replacement.",2
Within one day of use the phone randomly switched off. I tried to charge it and pressed the pwer key but there was no response. After a few tries i figured it out. This phone switches off randomly and can only be switched on by pressing volume key and power key simultaneously.,2

"Please dont buy this, u will regret",2
"Pathetic range. My internet connection speed in 150 Mbps and standing right next to this router I get wireless speeds of less than 50Mbps. I tried with multiple devices, still wireless speed is nowhere hear what I expected. Wired connection gives the expected speed.",2
"There's a great length of things to write about this product.but will make it short.
The booting takes aweful lot of time and one would hate to wait for such a long time to get connected to internet.Fine tuning is requied for the UI interface of the router.Now the main important thing is it gets disconnected very frequently and it is such a pain that we literally want to throw it out. Only after the reboot it gets connected and believe me it takes nearly 4-5 minutes to connect.And if your working or doing payments or gaming multiplayer then this is not the product to look after.

They should somehow fix this issue or stop manufacturing this particular product.",2
Printer Hardware material should be strong,2
"1. This product is a sheer waste of money. I spent INR 900 on this & feel bad about it.
2. The sound quality is okay for listening music but other than that it is of no use.
3. When I had placed the order for this product, it had ""True Wireless"" mentioned on the listing but that's no true. It is a totally false claim by the company.
4. Do not buy this, you will get a lot of better options in the same price range.",2
Using it since 1 month. I did not like Wireless network connectivity. Often printer could not print with wireless connectivity. Need to try with USB connection.,2
Too much high bass no clarity in sound,2
Router is not up to my expectations. Range of router is not as I thought. I used it as extender,2

The battery is definitely good, and lasts more than a full day.
However on the down side, the phone is very heavy, camera is ordinary and it feels sluggish to use.",2

Band strap quality is very low,2
I have submitted 2 complaint for this product and quality. Low voice and nosound problem.,2
"Stay away. Go for branded one.
I bought this as I thought spending 3000-4000/- on Microtek and Luminous UPS for 5 min. Job, within which society backup would be, makes sense. However, I was wrong and have ordered for Luminous UPS today.

This device is small and neat, however, writhin one year, this showed its true colors and so does their support. They just won‚Äôt respond. Unprofessional, irresponsible company.

This UPS worked well initially and then slowly and steadily gave up and doesn‚Äôt work now. My router keeps on knocking off because of this UPS. The moment I unplug the UPS and put it on direct connection, everything works fine and router does not trip even once in DAYS or WEEKS, the moment I put it back, router trips minimum 10 times a day.

Anyhow, before buying do consider this genuine feedback. It‚Äôs not worth it. And, thanks Resonate for good almost 8-9 months.

If possible improve this product, I really liked it but needs good amount of improvement and most importantly, your support, wether on call or whattsapp, it SUCKS. Sorry but it‚Äôs true.",2
This phone is good and if you want to buy a budget smartphone then you should go for a but if you want to buy a gaming smartphone then this phone is not good because while playing games the phone is very lacking and I can't play the game properly so if you want to buy a budget smartphone then you can go for it but if you want to buy a gaming smartphones so don't go for it.

Poorvi quality mobile,2

The earphones in terms of music quality, premium and decent asthetics are good, that's what you expect from such a brand. But when it comes to the durability of the earphones, JBL has always turned me down with the poor durability of its earphones. This right earphone malfunctioned withing 3.5 months n similarly the right one too went off within 7-10 days. I love the music quality but hate when I have to replace it within 3-4 months.

Wifi keeps on switching from 2.4 to 5 ghz which causes distruption if you use vpn... Not a good product... Speed is same as other cheaper routers no improvement,2
"AMD graphics card is supported 1080p
Nvidia graphics is supported 1080p ,but crash after 10min
Only turn on freesync is supported 1080p in Nvidia graphics,
Response time 5ms, total suck so anyone want to buy contact me 50% offer for you",2
The sync function is defaulty....hard to sync with phone...so giving false reading,2
"Sound quality is super , but the major issue is build quality, wire quality so cheap , wire broke in 30 days so this product not worth this price point . if u want long durability so try sony,.",2
Came without charging cable. Returned.,2
Worst speakers .No hanging holes at the back of the speakers but the sound quality awesome .,2
"Only for music listening not at all recommended for taking calls while you can hear crisp clear but mic is pathetic and everyone keeps complaining, voice is low, not clear it's mixing up etc etc. Battery backup is good and lasts for 6+ hours once charged. User friendly? I will keep it low as it's quite difficult to know how much charge is available at a point. The charging box just has a small dim led which hardly tells you anything. If it's blinking take it as charging and if static, completely charged. I don't know how people are recommending it so much here for voice calls and wfh uses, I had to love back to wired headphones ‚òπÔ∏è",2
"Not suitable for music. Boss just like local ear phone.
Don't know how this much rating came to this product.
Previously I used boat ear phone the sound quality was very good. I feel it's not original product",2
"These earphones are go quality ones give good sound but there is noticable lag while watching sometimes and definitely during gaming.
Also they keep getting disconnected after few mins of not using and sometimes it shows it's connected still but then disconnects when u try watching or playing music.",2
There is no noise noise cancellation. If you receive a call you also hear a vibration that disturb in calling. And i seriously want to return this item. But its battery life is good,2
No comments!!,2
The ink cartridge is poor,2
The canon engineer came and installed the cartridge and filled the colors . But the printer didn't start. It has some problems internally. Sending it back to seller for refund . Don't mind the stars as I haven't used it. Will update for refund status .,2
"I am not buying this product again because it's not good in fitting on the ears , sound quality is less than fine and product is fragile .
In future I would pay some extra to get a better quality headphone , something that can actually be usefull.",2
"BP, heart rate and O2 readings are not accurate",2
"Nice print , small cartidges , value for Money ... Basic all in one printer ...worth",2
cant use it during travel. The sound is coming out even on average device volume.,2
Not a worth buying product battery drain 100% in one hour despite without adding notifications on phone and calls,2

Not buy this product. Audio quality is very poor. When I try to return or replace this item then i can't excess the full process.,2
Not happy,2
After 3 months one of the earphones stopped working,2
"I travelled by public conveyance full day and it's counting steps I don't know how. I have hardly walked 2km but it's showing 9754 steps. I removed band from my hand and tapped on heart beat measurement and it has shown 100 bpm of heart beat.

I wonder if I can exchange this one",2
Step count is not accurate...While travelling it counts steps... Music control works sometimes...also records blood pressure after removing band from wrist,2
OS lags alot... responsiveness not good.,2
"before this i had F&D A180X the sound clarity of that product is awesome but bass was not that powerful.
bught this speaker from flipkart in big billion day sale cause of sbi card offer.
speaker is loud and really good with few cons:
1. sound clarity is little low in comparison with A180X.
2. bass changes itself with the increase n decrease in sound. so u may have to set basse everytime u change the volume.
3. Faced bluetooth auto disconnect issue 1 time.
4. be careful with the bass u can damage ur speaker cause bass has no limit. there are 30 levels or steps for both sound and bass volume separately. if u have set bass to the maximum level(30) at low volume level(suppose 1) and then u increase the volume the bass also starts to increase beyond its limit with the volume and subwoofer starts to crackle at volume level between 5 and 10. if u further increase the volume the subwoofer will get damage for sure.
5. remote design is really poor. it works but looks like a cheap chinese 3rd class product.

pros:
1. the bass is really awesome far better than A180X
2. loud with decent vocals and poor treble. There is a lack of crispness in sound.
3. FM with good reception.
4. bluetooth version 4.0 or 4.2(it is 4.0 in manual but 4.2 on official site).
5. overall sound signature is little bit warmer side.",2
"The side button fell of within 10 days of wearing, go for other watches.",2
Pooooooooor phone! Can't describe it. Not worth using this in this Gen. In fact it's better using MI phones at this same cost.,2
From the third day onwards called persons are not able to hear my voice. I think it has some defect,2
Speaker grill is damaged received,2
Its been slightly More than a month since i am using it and only one bud is working :( also when i plug in google assistant opens up and start changing songs automatically. Not able to locate service centre in mumbai. Any help?,2
"Call sensors not working, auto brightness also not working within just 2 months of purchase.",2
"The product was initially good but after 4 months of use, first the mic stopped working and now, 1 of the ear is also not working. Very disappointing. I was hoping this would last at least 7/8 months.",2
"Although the price was on the lower side , the maintenance cost is a lot. This printer is apt for school projects and all but not meant for office use.",2
Git a used product.The package was torn off .,2
Range is not good in 1m also. Bad product.,2
Not working fast.,2
Suddenly the power on wifi router goes off. Bad product. The wifi names suddenly disappears and I am having numerous problems with this router. I have to restart the router evey 30 mnts.,2
"Product was worth the money we spent..
But packaging and delivery was the worst ever I saw..",2
Left side went off within 2 week.0% Noise cancellation .The only good thing is its mic,2
"Beautiful watch. Lots of features. But I have doubts on the accuracy of the pedometer. Every 100 steps I take, the watch shows 130 steps. That's a whopping 30% inaccuracy!! Also sleep measurement is also not accurate. It shows starting of sleep from the time I was actually awake!! In toto, my old MI fit band 2 is way more accurate than this. If you are not particular about fitness and want to buy a feel good smartwatch, then it is for you. The app is swanky, the skins are cool. Perfect for a show off.",2
Specs are confusing in Amazon,2
Did not work long. Appears to be a low wuality product. Stopped working in two months.,2
NOT GOOD BASS.Totally rubbish,2
I liked the MiBand 3 better because the screen felt a bit more premium. With this you can see where the display unit is and aesthetically feels a bit cheaper. Maybe in a generation or two theyll have the screen blended nicely so that it doesnt feel like a prototype device.,2
So much costly,2
Quality of sound is ok but the connectivity is not good and every 1 mins there is loss of voice between AirPod and Laptop. Tried resetting but still the product is not working fine,2
"Loved this phone a lot but from the day one it has some issues

1) poor voice quality
2) little bit of heating
3) bluetooth device not connecting

I don't find any lag. Camera was good, display was good, sound was fantastic.

Anyhow I returned the phone. Had some Hassel with Amazon during the return schedule but amazon resolved it smoothly.

No point in blaming amazon if you purchase this phone and found some issues. Redmi has to release the update to fix these issues.",2
"Bit slow, I'm not satisfied with this product",2
"This is the third Xiaomi product I'm purchasing but this time I'm highly disappointed. 8A phone is no different than Redmi 7A except that this is quite bulky to hold and has better battery life and comes with a C-type charger. Redmi 7A is a lot better than 8A in terms of design. Don't go for the Blue coloured one of 8A, cos it has a funny shade than what's seen in the pictures. Camera claims to have 13mp lens but has no quality of even an 8mp Samsung phone. Also has poor settings with so much beautifying filter which makes everything look so lighter in shade, polished and cartoon like. Xiaomi used to deliver top notch quality phones and camera at the same price range when they launched phones during 2015-16 time period. Xiaomi is compromising a lot on camera quality. The touch response of the handset i received is slow. Also they're refusing to return the product and instead they're giving me a replacement of the same phone which I don't want. When we contacted the Amazon customer care they're asking us to place the return after accepting the second replacement. Why this complication when you can return the first right away than make everyone take double risk of travel in this time of pandemic.",2
App works slowly and no mew watch faces. Need more watch faces and updated app,2
"Print quality is ok, but ink consumption is more. Wired installation is good but it doesn't connect wirelessly so be careful if you are buying for wireless. Difficult to use scanner, not friendly at all.",2
"Bad product.
It's got damaged within 3 months.",2
Works perfectly but until Battery is healthy. Mine is 18 months old and now only keep charge on few seconds so no longer useful. You need to keep buying it every time battery becomes weak. Should have provision to replace battery.,2
We can buy but after 6 months its broken down,2
It is very nice product,2
"hangs frequently...
does not even support Microsoft teams",2
"Cartridges are more costly compared to printers... Once you buy this printer, then after 150 pages you have to buy a cartridge and the starting price of a cartridge is 1800/-.
From my perspective, you have to buy a printer with an ink tank which is better than this printer.",2
"Headphone build quality is good. Light weight and very Comfortable to wear for long time. Easy to connect and sound quality is excellent.
Only con is when connected to laptop through bluetooth, mic is not working.

Update:
After 4 days of usage,
1. YouTube audio is cracking, cross checked with my old headphone.. no problem with that.
2. Cannot use this headphone for Calls. Mic is really low, people on other side of the calls not able to hear me. Fire Boltt should atleast provide aux cable with mic.
3. Connectivity is getting degraded, 1st n 2nd day no problem, but on 3rd day onwards ""kaarrr"" sound coming even when my phone is placed in front of me.

So downgraded rating to 2stars n returned the headphone.",2
"Phone look is good in this price range. Temper and cover also come with this.
I bought it on 24 Oct 2020. It delivered in just 2 days. But the sim slots are not working.",2
"Product comes with a 1 year warranty, but it stopped working with in 6 months only, then how can I use my warranty !!",2
Watch LK not support iPhone.,2
Seriously we are paying 29k for this product and one would expect it atleast comes with SD card but nooo utterly disgusting. I regret not purchasing this In flipkart it comes with SD.,2
"Does not have ""always on"" feature",2
2/5 ... no base of output,2
"I bought this as an upgrade to my entry level Tp-Link 841N router, which has served pretty well so far. Ours is a 1500 sq ft house and the existing router serves almost the entire house, barring some distant corners or areas. But it gives trouble while playing videos from my iPhone 7 to the newest Apple TV. So I was excited to get this new router. I was hoping that its multiple antennas and dual band will be helpful to increase the throughput and range both. Note that the company claims 1300 Mbps throughput with this device.

While the new router did extend the coverage and could now fully serve the entire house, including distant corners, I was mighty disappointed with the LAN throughput. I used iperf3, a well known tool to measure link speed, but I could never go beyond 200 Mbps, that too when both the devices are in the same room. As soon I moved to the second room (still just couple of meters away, but with a wall in between), the throughput dropped to 100 Mbps and after second wall it dropped to less then 40 Mbps. I tried various devices, like iPhone 7, 2014 Macbook Pro, another latest Dell laptop, but nothing helped. In fact, on Amazon's suggestion, I also ordered a replacement and tried that, but no luck.

Then I called up Tp-Link support and gave them remote access to my machine. After spending almost 40 minutes on the phone, they couldn't diagnose anything and promised to have some senior person call me the next day. Unfortunately, I did not get the call at the agreed time and hence I decided to return the router. Tp-Link finally called me the next day after I returned the router. They then promised me that they will repeat the tests in their labs and send me a report. That report never came.

I am still thinking what's the next router to try, May be Netgear or Asus. For now, the 841N is streaming Netflix videos pretty fine to my HD TV, so I am not feeling the urgency.",2
"This headphone is good for listening music, but not at all good for calls, gets disconnected while ongoing skype or teams call, do not recommend if you are buying this for calls.",2
"It the worst router I have seen
Its wifi sugnal is very poor I have a wifi of 50 Mbps but this router gibes me a speed of 10 Mbps",2
"Do not buy some features not working as expected . Like you are not able to change music during workout tracking. Mi band 3 work better than this .
Touch screen is good, but the tracking does not work properly.",2
"After 2 months it is not working properly pl check ur material properly and send to us one ear phone is working plz check ur product
There it is mentioned as 1 year warranty but it is even not working 6 months properly
Plz ur ear phone quality first",2
The product was good for the first month or two but now it has not been working properly for a few weeks. The earphone in completely out of order and there's no sound.,2
Battry backup is low,2
"Doesn‚Äôt fit for calling....... the listener feels you are in some fish market or political rally. No noise cancellation, can buy something better than this. But good battery life and fast charging (with case) and average sound quality. Also Siri adaptable.",2
"Adapter is of very poor quality. As it is an external component and not covered under warranty so quality of adapter is compromised. Within a week of delivery it stopped working, had to buy new costed extra Rs 600.",2
Mobile heated up after few mins of usage. Touch is not highly responsive. Mobile vibrates while playing audio in speaker at near full sound. Hangs few times. Display & call quality is good. Poor build quality. Product failed to meet satisfaction.,2

Very small screen size. Don't fall for 5.5 inches advertisement. Check dimensions.,2
"Nothing on amazon or seller
The review is mostly for the device!!

The device gave up on pairing within one week. No matter what I tried from NOISE website troubleshooting guides, all in vain.
Imagine you buy a smart watch and it behaves stupidly....waste of my purchase!!",2
"One Cartage doesn't prints even 100 pages
Cartage is very costly",2
woring good.very essential for home in emergency.,2
One side has stopped working already. Just 2 months old pair. No warranty so dont buy. It's not worth the money though its JBL,2
There is a serious issue with this router. Lan connection speed frequently reduces. Sometime 2.4Ghz speed reduces. . Only 5.0Ghz works fine. Need to restart almost daily to correct this issue.,2
It has stopped working within one year,2
Battery backup is a total waste,2
I GOT BROKEN,2
"The set up is the easiest with the tether app. However the actual problem lies with the 5GHZ wifi signal. Even sitting right beside the router does not give more than 40% of my actual Broadband speed. I had bought an extender TP link RE650 but it wont detect the 5 Ghz wifi signal. No matter how many times you reset restart it will not detect. I had another TP link router C50. The extender would immediately pick up 5 GHz. Even the C50 router gives better wifi on 5 Ghz. This router has a serious problem with 5ghz wifi. I returned the first one hoping the second one would be better. Even the second router had the same problem with 5GHz signal. Ultimately i had to return it and go for Asus router. Probably in order to make a cheaper product and bundling all the features like MUMIMO, Mesh and Beam-forming, the main feature of Wifi got ignored. Instead TP link should get the basic right for this router. Absolutely disappointed and wasted 2 whole day with this router",2
"Not worthy for the price, hanging often, data accuracy is very poor",2
Nice features but hang sometimes,2
Dislike that some time empty pages are coming out wastage of paper of some half fate printing ..without any reason,2
Facing issue of connection loss due to Bluetooth connectivity,2
Cd missing but not installing I want to printer soft wear,2
"This product is an old one as it is manufactured 1 year ago. I bought it on Holi sell, but after Holi sell the price dropped. It is not fair a marketing.",2
"After 24 hours of usage on my 115mbps broadband, I find speed gets throttled considerably. This is NOT A GIGABIT router and as such, is way overpriced. Also the mentioned 5GHz & 2.4GHz handling capabilities are a misnomer as higher speeds(>100mbps) gets bottle-necked. Spoke to customer care about returning this and upgrading to C6 or Tenda, but was informed Im locked with this.",2
Router is getting hang frequently every day. Need to reboot.,2
Battery backup is worst,2
"Battery way too low
Camera is just ok
Display is fine
Doesn't have light sensor uses camera for automatic screen brightness",2
Cost high,2
Not for music lovers. No bass at all. Volume is high for calling. This headphones are good for calling but not for music.,2
"Font camera not good very much poor
Mobile working little slow phone Not good",2
Disappointed as they are charging very slow..sound quality not upto the mark,2
It's goodüëç,2
After purchasing one month it's right lead is not working. Very bad quality. It is not comfortable to use when you are sleeping.,2
"I purchased this because of the good experience of my earlier headphone.
This headphone looks good and cheap but this is having quality problems. I keep getting a crackling noise on my moto g5s plus. sometimes one side earphone stops sounding during a call. This works relatively good on PC.
Not recommended.",2
"Only battery life is gud
Despite gud ram this phone is slow n gets switch off wen multiple apps are open

Printer is good but cost/page is too much expansive.,2
"Man these earphones worked for only 6 months and i can't fix them using warranty card bcz of quarantine. And i think other company's earphone will provide better service in this price. :(
Edit; man it's useless now and I can't help it",2
"It is worst product, my friend brought it just ten days back it is asking always head cleaning, so that I ordered second time and cancel the order.",2
"poor treble. Bass quality is not clean. Mid range is ok. Noise cancellation is farce. Ear pads cause heating up of outer ear. So many disclaimers in product manual:- Works only when outside noise is loud and typical. Not recommended while walking ! Does not isolate common house hold backdrop like talking or washing utensils. Never believe online reviews...can be just advertising...
Works with much lower bass when in wired mode...strange. No equalizer options.
cheaper headset by Boltt is better .which I bought together with this.
Even Senheisser HD wired is better.
Seems 35 hr battery life is the only nice thing. I strongly feel the ear cup design is crucial for stressfree extended use. Ventilated types",2
"Battery backup was fine initially. But after 5 to 7 days, the battery draining very fast. I am very sad from this battery. Please replace my phone.",2
"Im actually reviewing my earlier submission.. the sound is good while it lasts (relative to the price range). BUT, extremely low tensile wire, very delicate, NOT for rough use.. right ear stopped working after 4 months of use; neither of JBL's helplines, phone and email, are functioning. So ya.. it IS at the end of the day a piece of JBL for under 500 bucks..!",2

1 of the earphones stops working after a few months. This is my second experience. And I don't know where to claim the 1 year Warranty specified with the product.,2
Bass not good,2
Not that good product...It is lacking most of the times,2
"Noise cancellation does not work. I can hear everything but the person on other side can't hear property at all, unless you are alone in a room. Most of the time I've to put my phone on doeaker mode to talk as other person cannot hear.
I already had bluetooth ear pods , I bought this for noise cancellation but v disappointed. I'm returning these.",2
"I don't like this product. For the music, the sound quality is not so good. I got the product in the evening & 2nd day morning I can't hear incoming calls sound. I tried mutiple times on/off. but no use. So I returned the product.",2
"Put lot of pressure on ears and you would not like to keep on ears more than 30mins.
Same thing someone told me when I ordered this item but I ignored.
Now I feel I should have listened.",2
"Keeps disconnecting, sometimes it also keeps vibrating while while call is on.
Battery is very bad.

Otherwise no such issues.",2
Easy to Install. But Tech support is not so good. And wifi signal is not covered more than one room. Obviously go for two antenna with same budget.,2
Not like old printer new product not good more sound and slow,2
Cartilage goes empty within 20 30 prints...,2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Likes: screen when it works looks fine. 24 inch screen with slim bezel, good colours and easy on eyes. Ergonomics of this monitor is great

Dislikes: frustrating issue with flickering, see the video. I have ordered replacement, I will update this review once the I get to see the replacement.
I didn't like the plastic body and the USB hub sometimes don't work, I had to change the port of my attached device. The ports are at awkward position and it is hard to reach unless you rotate the screen. Their quality is not so great.",2
Mobile has more software problems .camera clearty is to poover and mobile has heavy heating problem.,2
cartridge drain very fast,2
This watch has a good looks and okayish performance. But it has major issues in connection with phone. It gets disconnected every now and then. and then it may take 1min to 1hour to reconnect it. And somedays it doesn't get connected at all. Pathetic blutooth it has.,2
Scanner glass damaged ... on arrival..........,2
It's an amazing product but the one thing lack is bass control its poor. At this price range it could have given better features . Atleast the bass should be powerful. But that the worst thing. Don't buy if you are bass lover. I love when everything near me vibrate it feels out of universe overall it's ok ok.,2
"Phone bluetooth pairing is not working , wifi can not be connect, it doen not search any wifi connection
Low quality",2
"I have purchased this product on 3rd October 2019. And after using it for almost 1.5 months I am writing this review.Overall it is a nice upgrade from Mi band 3 as it has bigger screen,music control,you can set brightness level and also you can set many wallpapers .But the biggest bug which i found is that whenever you travel by car itsumber of steps increases automatically Basically it increases the steps counts and distance which normally increases whenever you are walking or running .But in this case the steps counts also increases whenever you travel by car.This is the biggest bug a fitness band could have as this is the primary reason people buy the fitness band inorder to keep a track on their daily workout.This was not the thing in Ki band 3 .So my suggestion would be if you really want a fitness band that can accurately track your steps count and the distance then Mi band 4 is not the good choice for you.",2
"Well we did try to give a ""branded in India"" a chance, with no restriction on budget I tried these ones after much hype about the brand and sorry to say they did dissappoint terribly. One side stopped working exactly to the date of purchase. Now for a 400 rupee earphone to stand in line at the service centre during the pandamic is seriously not hapenning. Will donate them to my next weeks charity box. What a waste really!",2
"Have been using the router since 3 months. Inspite of having 3 antennas, signal range is very limited, poor and inconsistent wrt my old iBall two antenna router. Also, if the WiFi is not used for some time, it just disappears. Need to restart again for connectivity. Am surprised with this quality from TP Link. Will certainly not recommend this model.",2
"I used Boat before, I lost them so I got these. This is very delicate, it came apart when taking out from bag. Sound quality was not that good. Stopped using after a week",2

"my earphones are not working under warranty period, and I don't get any options for replacement. don't trust this product.",2
"If you're a jbl fine. This review is not for you!
it's wire quality is so weak that more than feeling the emotions of song you are focused that the wire doesn't get damaged. Sound and everything good but look for better option like evidson b3/4 , ant audio , woofy bass head , klex X1 . Far more superior and you'll bless me when you get those products rather than this. will not suggest to buy.",2

Due to delivery boy act my both speakers ate damage please replace my speakers and give some punishment of your delivery boy,2
No Bluetooth,2
Average quality. Stopped working after one month. Motion detection alarm not good.,2
"I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. The router continually turns on and off itself and often loses connectivity making using it a very harrowing experience. It is impossible to get a stable connection for extended use be it for video calls, gaming or shopping. I tried updating the firmware, resetting it multiple times but there is no improvement. TP - link forums also show that I'm not the only one facing such issues.",2
"Purchased it for my wife to track her heart beat 5 months back.
So, I would be in better position to review it.
1. Never checked sleeping track. So, can't comment on it.
2. Steps count is OK.
3 But as far as Heart beat count is concern. Many times, I have noticed, wrong heart beat count. Have to refresh many times to get the updated and correct count. Sometimes It show 141 and after refresh in the next second 91 and again 130. Very confusion.
So, much will depend on your luck, whether you will get the good band or will get the bad one like mine.

Thanks",2
Product stopped working properly after 1 week of usage.. every 5 mins the Internet gets disconnected. Worse product choice I made. There is no refund only replacement of item. So be prepared b4 u buy.. if u r lucky u will get it working for a long time like other reviews..,2

Very short coverage area. Not recommended.,2
"Very bad battery backup and after 20% battery level it keep saying 'Low Battery' continuously and during that time you must put it in charging as you will not be able to hear anything if in any call.
Also sound quality is not that good compared to normal headphone of such price.

The manufacturing is such stupid that its difficult to pull out the LAN cable as the clip is hidden under the body.. Would have been wiser if it was upside down,2
The phone's performance is a bit slow. There is no fingerprint reader.,2
Best product,2
Paper jam and printing time is 10 minutes,2
Damage in 2 month. Now not working at all.,2
Wrost product overall I suggest please don't buy when You use even 2 or 3 month's then after 1 side damaged not working properly and wire quality is very bad. In warranty I wanna contact customer care but he didn't respond at all,2

Not bad but try to other one,2
I liked the product in the beginning but the mic stopped working within 3 months. I did not expect this from JBL.,2
"Product is not packed in proper way, Box seal is open before receiving, little defect in headphone.",2
Product is good and the speed is very fast but the wifi area co erage is really small like 600 sqft only. I don't recommend tbis product.,2
"It's an ok product.
You should only expect quality of a 500 rs product and not expect quality of 1300 rs product. Bass is not up to expectations. Although for this price it's worth buying.
Biggest con is that it has no microphone.",2
Good product.Nice n helpful,2

It's really overheating... Click on the camera... Take 2-3 pics... You will feel it.... Why 2 type of chips in same phone... In India they are using exynos not snapdragon... Don't need to buy a new phone with this price.. You will get lots of second ones within a week.. For a lesser price..,2

"Honest review
Main problem: boat persisted their name in super uncomfortable. It cause heavy pain in your ear after 15 minute and it's heavy. One side of my head get start to pain after 10_15 min

It's look is stylish, but there is a lot of gap btwn your head and the portion connecting the head ups which cause an awful look

Sound quality is very good at this range
Build quality is average. Should be carefull when adjusting the headset

Base is good
Overoll you could get another comfort one within this range",2

Verdict: don't buy to not get disappointed",2
It stopped working after 4 months. Not sure what to do with this.,2
"I used the printer for around few months and printed only few documents, but all of a sudden the Printer stooped working 3 weeks back, in fact it was not powering up. The local service center replaced the supply unit but still it was not powering up and so suggested to replace the logic board. It took around 3 weeks to get the board. I even had to sent an email to Epson's escalation head to get it at least in 3 weeks.. and when the next engineer came and just switched on the printer without doing any repairs, and it suddenly started working... hmmm... strange.. now it is under observation... but I have printed many assignments of kids that were pending during the past 1 month... It looks good and back to work now... lol.",2

COLOUR JET REFILLING ISSUE,2
THE PRODUCT DILIVERD WAS ALREDY OPEN WITH ALL ORIGINAL PLASTIC WRAPPING REMOVED ..PROBABLY THIS IS A RETURN ITEM...BUT IT WORKED AS IT WAS SUPPOSE TO....SO IM NITHER SATISFIED NOT DISATIFIED WITH THE PRODUCT.,2
"revised after a service.

The watch looks like an Apple Watch - and thats the only reason why i've given it two stars because of build. is quite robust also. straps are interchangeable with a standard size. however the software leaves far to much lacking. the stems do not sync properly, if you miss out on a day, and sync after 1 day, you lose all data inspite of the watch having recorded, as the software on my iphone did not pick up the steps of the previos day unlike as they advertised.

if you are into serious sports - you might want to MI 5 band, which offers the same features, but has better app support, and tracking with the same features that this watch has at a lesser price. this watch is great for everyday use and for fitness IF you open and sync the app regularly.

Pros
- looks good like Apple Watch
- battery lasts 4 days as the 10 days advertised. think its mroe becaus of iOS problem
- measures heart rate and stress and SPO2 very accurately
- sleep patterns picked up fast and accurate

cons
- app still being developed. so had syncing issues when I first bought. after review on App Store - the developer quickly rectified. within 1 week, but since then ive returned the watch 2 times to the service center and the issues still persist!
- GPS doesn't record the route, just shows distance (accurate). so you can't track as per map and see your zones etc like how the MI app has
- spo2 is not on the home screen - but hidden until after you press the button, this can easily be fixed by developer if they want.
- not enough watch faces available so far.
- rise to wake the watch -doesnt work that well, needs to be more sensitive.

all in all, if the developers add more features to the software, this one will beat MI hands down with its looks and features.",2
"Three things..
1. The time shown in active workout mode is too small to read. Even with specs.
2. The distance tracking is inaccurate. The mobile app and the watch have a 300mtr difference.
3. You've to carry the watch as there's no GPS. So it wont show you the route.
4. There's no way one can go to the home screen while the workout mode is on. One has to stop the active mode.",2
Camera or display very low level price is so high,2
Printer ink cartridge is expensive.,2
"I don‚Äôt know maybe it‚Äôs with every headphone but after some months it‚Äôs starting paining my ear.

Defective item how can write review,2
"Wired line is OK. But my devices connected through Wifi are frequently getting disconnected. I reached the customer care but am getting different solutions every time but nothing is solving my problem. Without a stable connection it is irritating to get into calls or do some stuff.
Unfortunately while doing this trouble shooting, my return period with Amazon got over. I should have returned in the first shot itself rather than trouble shooting. Painful learning.",2
It's ok but lots of watching coming in same rate with good features,2

This product from lg is really very good within this price bracket of Rs 6300 but the delayed delivery by Amazon along with the missed HDMI cable made my experience really worse...Amazon please provide additional HDMI cable asap.Thats why 2 star.,2
Camera quality is worst,2

Such a worst product from Redmi . Never thought I will face such problems . Already replaced handset in a week within a purchase time. And now after few months handset is completely not working ...,2
Waste product ..it start connecting and disconnecting frequently,2
"It was lost after 3 days..üò† the belt was not good and it was the 3rd time I get to know that mi band is lost but this time it was mine üò©

You can go for Honor band 5 the only reason for it is that it has a watch like band which will not open automatically like Mi band and hence is more reliable and could not fall easily!

Other things of both the bands are same. I have uploaded the pictures of Honor band which I ordered from Flipkart after mi band was lost.",2
Touch is not at all sensitive. Sound quality is not that good. Range is okay. Sometimes doesnt re connect automatically.,2
"Cartridge is over within 30 prints, however the description says a higher number of prints",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Ye phone apne price ke hisaab se acha hai , slim v hai , dispaly lighting aur camera quality jayada thik nahi hai main display aur camera ko 2* rating deta hu",2
"I swapped it out after a week of usage. The overall performance left a lot to be desired. Then again, for the price, it is what one can expect.",2
"Bass is not gud, except that everything is ok ok",2
"Just worked only one month
After one month internet is not supported through this router... Don't go for it.",2
"Very Bad Battery Back up its was showing that 8 day back up how its is giving on one day battery back up after 100 % charging. i am very disappointing by he battery back up every day u have to changed it. rest is fine , Shape is very good looking features are as per mentioned .",2

Turned out to be below expectations.
6gb Ram is SMOOTH.

Fast charging is NOT GOOD at all.

photo clarity is not good.its coming face black.,2
"Very low sound, if you are music lover(in this budget) just increase your budget a little bit more and go for Sennheiser CX180. You will love it. :) Definitely......******",2
"I have got a defective product today I pluged earphone but it didn't work than I thought the ear phone is faulty I tried new one but this didn't work too. Then I tried both earphone on another phone these were working.
And returning period is also over but the good thing is I rarely use earphone but when I tried earphone today first time and found the product is faulty I have got a lot of anger but it was my mistake too that I didn't check it in starting days.
Ya, but it worthy to be criticized.
Instead of this sometimes it's touch do not respond instantly, I have got this problem later.",2
The print quality is very bad.,2
"The only good thing about it is its bass ,the noise quality will worsen after a month.Noise cancellation is ok.
And the company itself gurantees that it will break at the hinges ( extremely weak) and you will find that they don't offer a replacement even if the faulty hinges break without jerk/fall/mismanagement.
It's the same with many other people in the comments .
Go for JBl or others as My brother uses an infinity glide which is better in all aspects and is quite sturdy.",2
Ink price is too high,2
I have used this product for past two days and found that battery backup is not good. I really doubt on quality check .In My expreience this product is not giving me backup for router.Not sure why?. Quality of the product degrade. Same product i was using past two years it was working fine. This i had a very bad experience .Also when i asked for replacement i suspect same product send to me with new cover.Pls check on your quality,2
Bluetooth connectivity is good. But sound quality is not worth the price. Even the mic quality is below par.,2
came in a unSealed box (seemed used),2
"Waist of mony. No calling facility, music and other application control is not functional and device accuracy is worst üëé",2
"Very waste product
Not enough strong as compared to others

Don't waste your money please It's my personal advice",2
"It's ink cartridge are been completed only for 10 prints only so, please buy another printer",2
I received defective and damaged product. One speaker not working.,2
"The earphones have a really bad response to trebles. Bass is fine, but any regular music sounds as though there's white noise playing in the background. It is noticeable enough to be irritating. Even the free earphones you get with most mobile phones don't have this bad audio.",2
"Mic is not up to the mark, you have to hold it close to your mouth, to make it catch your voice. Sound quality is just okay with bass on the lower side. Overall it is not solving its purpose of being a Mobile Headset.",2
This is my 5th Samsung.Phone..Pls.do not buy...80% Battery drains in 1 day....It take 2 hrs to charge the Battery....Better go with Moto G...Will never go with Samsung Again,2
Battery waste,2
Sometimes it just drops the internet which is not expected from the router,2
"these printer print only 25 prints in one cartridge

Cartridge price is to high",2
Color ink is given very less. I did print 7 pages only then it's show brown light and print problem also or print sounds very loud,2
"The product broke within 6 months, bad quality .",2
Not that good. The performance is ok.,2
"The only thing that boat does is providing cheap yet premium looking products. But these lack the basic thing:
1. Too loud; if a person uses it for prolonged period they will feel pain in their ears.
2. The grip : these are too hard on the ears and cause sweating and pain.
3. Only good for bass.
4. sound leaks a lot.
5. Not a good option
6. Should opt for earphones rather than these premium looking budget friendly options.",2
Screen quality is bad. Screen cracked within 1 month.,2
Mobile hanging problem during call,2
Not feeling good with the buttons and voice clarity and camera ..,2
Not so good as expected.But it is easy to use and install. Print quality is average.when I install and fill the ink and charge it. It is below from its original level that actually I have seen firstly.,2
"First i bought this product and returned this item for mic problem, after received new product i have faced the same mic problem, can't use this headset for call purpose.

Pros: Sound quality is ok for this price.
Cons:
* not comfortable on ears getting pain on ears after using this for an hour
* you can hear the music from this headset without wearing on ear.

Overall: Not recommended this china product for others try some alternate brands.",2
"I guess my speaker is not workinh properly, As sound is not clear i need to replace this product to another kindly look forward",2
"For all the features to work as claimed, you have to wear it very tight on your wrists. In beginning, it might sound fun but after some time, the hand might feel numb due to tight grip. As soon as you loosen it a bit, all functions stop working correctly. Even the simplest idle alerts fail.",2
As mentioned in the description it doesn't cover that much area. It doesn't even cover 1BHK apartment. Similar product offered by other brands are much better. Really disappointed with the product. Please don't buy.,2
Camera quality very low,2
It has to improve the bass sounds,2
battery is very poor only 48 hours life,2
"It is not worth for Balcony as it's range is very short, the faces of a person moving on the street is not recognizable.
, actually I could install today in my balcony, but found it is not worth , if possible I want this to be returned and will buy another one of longer range.",2
Not a great strength,2
Refer above two screenshot of activities tracked by Google fit app n Noicefit smartwatch. Google fit free app works far better than Rs. 3000/- smartwatch...,2
Not warking tas,2
"All okay expect camera quality both front and back..I don't know much about phones, but what I see and provide a review.",2
Keeps disconnecting which is very irritating,2
Installation is easy but the signal strength is not upto the expectation. Only 4 Channels available for 5Ghz.,2
"1.Poor Display
2.Poor Camera.
3.Too much slow performance is too poor
4.Plastic quality.
5.No Gorilla Glass.
6.Poor Toch for Fingprint

Good

1.Good Batter Life",2
"Overall good but one major problem, its left side clicks if you press it while listening and the sound suddenly drops in left side then you have to press it again and again untill its fixed. Its not only with my unit same happened with my 2 friends.
So return it if you have the same problem.",2
"Good pricing but app needs many updates and sometimes it's switch off on automatically
Notifications are slow and many time doesn't show messages.",2
"Print quality is ok but black ink only comes with 1424 pages see my picture attached
My point of view Epson printer is not good compare to HP PRINTER,
Epson printer description showing 4500 pages but that is not correct ink tank 65 ml ink only come for 1500 pages",2
"I had the entry level router, the typical white WRN840 before purchasing this, I specifically went for this router assuming that this will simply be marginally better in WIFI range than the previous one. And oh was I so wrong, this thing covers the same, if not shorter range than the most simple router out there, and all the functions MIMO MOMO are just there for the sake of justifying the price point.Also, for a router that's supposed to be on 24/7, this thing gets hot at the bottom,A huge Red flag......well, this is the review,its upto you to decide :)",2
Its not been even 6 months and it got break..sound quality is nice...but useless if durability sucks... I stick the edge with favi stick...dont know how long it gonna last...dont buy...save your money...,2
"Product is defective, day 1 charger was not working. So we used new charger still battery doesn't charge, screen touch is also insensitive many times. Some of the basic applications doesn't run.",2
Phone is hang too much,2
All health measures are not accurate...and steps count is also not correct...only cna use like a digital watch,2
"Useless, my realme works always, but this dumb device does not work consistently and fails to read oxygen saturation. My suggestion is go for realme that is lot more reliable or oppo.",2
"It is not good phone.
Processor is very bad.
Hanngs many a times. Don't buy it.",2
The scanner and the copier were not working due to driver problems. Have complained the same to Amazon and Canon. Awaiting results from them.,2
"I amm attaching the worst wish card images but it is not uploading..worst wish note you can provide.. we are paying extra charges on this you can give us a small greeting card also..
This is very worst üòî",2
Fair product,2
"After a month, the router started disconnecting giving message ""Please check hardware connection to WAN Port"". I was like here we go another ticket for ISP, I never expected the router to be problem. Internet only works on 10M FULL DUPLEX which limits my speeds to 6Mbps while my actual speed is 20Mbps. Router refuses to sync at 100M FULL DUPLEX.",2
Not impressed with the build quality. Bass is not satisfying. Not a good product from JBL.,2
Pathetic product....I purchased it on 14th August and today is 26th August....one ear is not working inspite of using it very carefully...now my return date is also o er I need to through the product as it is of no use.,2
"So I have used Honor Band 5 and Mi Band 3 and they are much better at being a fitness band as compared to this ( so called watch ). Doesn't track pulse properly at all, naps are not recorded. The app doesn't realise how to take smart average, if I am not wearing for 2 days of week it counts them in my avg sleep. Touch is bad too. Invest a bit more if you want a fitness watch or buy a band at this range.",2
"""Sound quality is not upto the mark"", ""noise still coming from outside"", ""bass is not at all coming maybe bcz of price quality is like this"".",2
Heart beat sensor can get very inaccurate during workout. Sometimes even after running for 30 mins it shows 70 something,2
My product didn't even last for a month worst I guess it's a basic earphone and amazon cheats.,2
Double tab touch not workking,2
lost the adapter its not working really disappointed,2
"Product stopped after 20 days .
Not able to claim warranty also.",2
"All I can say it has poor signal, I am struggling to get signals within 5 meters range, not worth, seriously thinking to upgrade.",2
"Sound is like 1958 music system , its not worth buying , sound quality is good when you coose to mute the speaker, useless absolutely useless.",2
Battery is just pathetic. Doesn't give backup for a week also. Worst mistake of purchasing this useless product. Mi band 3 is still best with high vibration and good battery life.,2
Just a copy of Apple watch. Poor battery backup. On light usage 6 to 7 days max. No always on display and wrist lifft up is irritating. Heart rate tracking always says keep still even though you r freezed. Waste of 4k I wud have returned it if it wasn't a gift,2
No warranty card inside. Product seems to be opened.,2
Started giving problems now. How to get technical support,2
"The information about the product is not real,subwoofer is 30 watts and satellite speaker is 4 watts so the actual information about the product the mentioned is fake...Better to choose some other products.",2
"Definitely NO for coding/online reading activity.

LG is NG (Not Good) in displays",2
Not a great product. It is full of glitches. Been 20 days since I bought still keeps on lagging. Doesn't show notification. And battery backup is of 2 days only. Customer support is also unable to rectify the concern.,2
Hanging,2
Not that good for printing. Worth the money though.,2
"I was astonished to see the price of these headphones as Rs 350, I have used the same brand's over the ear headphones, and they perform pretty well; but this one is epic fail. This series is called the Bass series, and the bass is minimal. I could not hear the song beats.
From noise cancellation perspective they are good, but if you are a music beats lover, then these are not for you.",2
Amazing product but printing speed is very slowly,2
"quality not good, cartridge got empty within 5 days, and printer couldn't take the paper in for printing ....better don't buy this again",2
"Range provided by the router is very poor, main reason I bought this was that I needed a slightly better range than my broadband service provider‚Äôs router. This is even worse than that basic 2 antenna 5dbi router.",2
I used it only 4 or 5 times till now and it‚Äôs not working properly.i was thinking that it might be setting problem but no it‚Äôs not a setting problem when I press the click button it stuck and on the screen it always show busy or error. I got frustrated when I pick it up for clicking pictures. With this problem first I have to switched it off and then on then it work only for 1 click after it again it show busy and the click button not work even I m not able to press it . It gets jam all the time.kindly do the needful bcz it‚Äôs in still warranty.,2
"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS EAR PHONE, THIS IS WASTE OF MONEY, OVER A USE OF ONLY 6 MONTHS ONE SIDE EAR PHONE GETS OFF AUTOMATICALLY, VERY THIRD CLASS PRODUCT, NOT EXPECTED THIS FROM JBL.",2
I am using Honar Play mobile and I selected call notifications but not getting sim 1 call notifications where as sim 2 call notifications are coming ? Touch is also not good,2
The range is not so great.,2
"If you want good speed over WiFi as your lan speed i wouldn't recommend this product. I was expecting at least i would get 50% of my actual speed but this router is not giving that, and signal strength also not stable.",2
"It works well for 18 days but afterwards It is not charging.
so, buy it on your own risk",2
not proper satisfy,2
"WiFi signal is very weak, even if you just go another room signal drops to 1. Also i have to restart it again and again in between.",2
Good.but not very good.,2
"This watch does not show calories burnt. Only gives no. of steps, and even these are not correct. Exercise modes are useless if it cannot show calories burnt. Heart rate measure is inaccurate. Found it totally useless.",2
"The only good thing about these is the warranty of 1 year. I was expecting better sound. I almost want to return the product but it comes with mic, warranty and at INR 349. So I will keep it. Average sound quality or worse.
Buy it only because it is economical.",2
Not good quality by camera. And it is hang after some time..,2
Mobile is getting heated even I just used for initial settingup and copying the old data that too on first day. But only the upper half of the display getting heated and lower part is little better. Just used camera for more than 30mins and started getting the overheated alert. And temperature became around 47¬∞C.,2
Not very good it ok,2
"High printing cost per page,",2
Mentioned that stand bottom body will be Metal and turn out that it plastic. This is so no good.,2
"I feel it's a waste of money.... though the printer cost is less, cartridges are costly... compared to other products in the market... each cartridge can print 100-120 pages only.",2
This is too small for me .Tge headphones are molded my glasses.It is not for normal person,2
Product is good,2
I have been using sony headphones for over 2 years. You can complain about sound but material quality is robust. And for this Boat product sound quality is perfect but it hasn't been even a year and it broke into pieces easily...... Had to bind both parts with tape.... Didn't expected that,2
Phone working very very slow phone working very very slow please conside if u used first time use smart phone,2
Worst decision by redmi it does not comes with back cover and tempered glass,2
"A couple of friends referred me to this product. Unfortunately, the received product is defective. Waited for a long time. Finally, procured the same again.
Hope it works well this time.

Cheers!",2
Looks premium and mi claims that it has quite a lot of features. Has a better IR blaster for remote accessibility. Only the camera is the best in the price range and other aspects it‚Äôs a Piece of shit.Kindly don‚Äôt buy Becoz it‚Äôs worth only for 8-9k Move to Samsung or any other phone. Fedup with the performance of the phone in the very first day. The 2stars are only for the camera Quality and IR blaster. Phone lags much and Gaming performance is too poor and way of handling this phone requires a lot of patience as it loads for longer time for some of the app details. Battery last better and Camera quality is good that‚Äôs all. Not worthy for 13.5k.Pls don‚Äôt buy it if you expect performance from this phone or if you think you can have better features phone.,2
Not quality phon..only bzt phon...bssü§®,2
Baught 5 months ago. Until now (9 may 2019) it was working nicely. And today it has suddenly stopped working. Didn't expect this from canon brand,2
"I didn't liked the lagging of the watch. Sometimes the touch doesn't work.
Also it keeps getting disconnected if you are little far from the watch.
The heart rate sensor is not accurate
Sometimes it tracks the sleep sometimes it not.

And trust me it feels like you are using some cheep Chinese product",2
"Don't even think of buying it . After 1 month of use the headphones cover got apart....
And now when we call customer care....
They don't even answer the calls and their customer care is fake.....",2
"Pros
Good looking with pure white exterior
Easy to install
Cons
Longer lasting cartridge is a false statement, i got the new printer with dry cartridge, had to order a new one, which dried out with 20 to 30 pages
Bulky
White color sure looks good but prone to getting dusty
Always takes 2 to 3 attempts to connect with phone app
I used the 3050 model prior to this for 6 years and still find print quality better in that
Cartridge is difficult to find in ecommerce sites and even in HP online
No resale value - due to the cost of cartridge and very short self life, nobody wants this printer",2
"I got a different model. BenQ GW2280-T 19-inch LCD. There was no HDMI cable in the package. The color quality is very bad. Black appears as dark green on screen. The images are not sharp. Only suitable for coding and text based work. Not suitable for image editing , and video editing related work.",2
Printing quality is gud ..but speed is too slow ..,2
Product is good but not working correctly,2

"One side of the earphone stopped working after 7 months
Not worth it",2

Product is good with good sound but you can find good sound in most of the products in this category. Bluetooth connectivity is to poor and noice cancellation doesn't work.,2
Below average phone in this price range. Battery lasts only 24hrs with very normal use. Camera is below standards. Processor is not very impressive. Mi Note 10 would have been a better choice.,2
Not satisfied with range.. especially through walls. When in range speed is good.,2
I want to register my headphone for warranty and they asked for 13 digits serial number mentioned on the box . But there is no number mentioned. Is this is a duplicate product?,2

Everything else is fine but a fitness band has no purpose of doesn't give u accuracy.

This apps running feature gives completely different picture.
It tracks around 300m lower per km run (underestimate)
Same goes with treadmill runs. It overestimates the distance there.

BUT while it underscores the distance, it overestimates the calories.
I have used and validated my stats with goqqi, Nike run and Google for app. All of these stats are in sync except Mi band.

Pls consider before buying.",2
Sound quality is average. Mic position is not convenient. Not suitable for calls. Design doesn't fit in properly. Mi headsets performance was much better.,2
I am writing this review after using it for 2 Months. Phone is ok with the price. Fast charging is useless it is just nor charging. my old phone Moto E4+(6000 mAH charge faster than this this Redmi phone.,2
Dislike sound very poor,2
Sound quality is fine but let me get this clear IT STARTS HURTING YOUR EARS EVEN AFTER A BIT OF USE ITS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!,2
Axe cable is not worthy lack of audio... if buy this ur ear are been damage ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùåüí¶. If ur in one point of sound the audio is so loud üò™ .the battery is not ok its only 2hrs of payback time,2
Don't waste Ur money buying this useless watch. It has pairing issue all the time & U can't even reject Calls in watch notification,2
"The sleep tracking is pretty basic. You can control the music playing from your phone from the band. You can receive or reject a call from the band. You can also read all the notifications from the band.
The battery will last around 10 days with normal settings. Charging is a bit hassle as you have to remove the display unit from the strap to connect it to the charger. But it isn‚Äôt much of a deal as it only needs to charge once in every 10 days or so.
Some people may face a itching on the skin if you sweat or get the wrist wet.
Looks good and the durability is pretty good. Rough use is totally fine.",2
"I am really disappointed with this one. The earphone stopped working completely in 5 months. Initially too I faced issues with low mic sensitivity when on calls. The other person couldn't hear a thing until I eat the mic. I complained about that as well to the customer care, but there were of no help. Then last week the right earphone, where the mic is, stopped working. I am not buying earphones from JBL again.",2
Battery life is too bad. Storage is very limited. Storage full message is annoying. Sync is very slow. Voice command is not yet enabled in India. Lots of improvement is required.,2
"I quite hate the mobile... Not physically but internally... If you are thinking of using this mobile for gaming forget it, cuz ur games will lag surely... Cuz it started lagging and many much bugs after only 3-4 months and all apps would start lagging if battery life is 10-20%... And I hate it... And also camera is worst quality... Also it's security is unsafe... And uses storage of mobile by 12 gb for no reason... And downloads useless Chinese apps without user's permission... I just hate this mobile... And also main problem. It overheats just like moto mobile, charger's quality is also bad.",2
One simple review. It hangs many times in a day. I have only 60 app installed(all). Previously i was using more than 150 apps jn redmi 4 without any problem of hanging. Very bad upgrade from redmi 4 to 9 pro (both 4GB+64GB),2
It was a good product at first.,2

If you're someone who uses headphones for calling and speaking then I definitely do not recommend these earphones. The mic quality is really bad and it got spoilt within two months of use.,2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Not good, very bad",2
Initially this product is good and within few months right ear stopped working.! I've been trying out everything but couldn't fix it.! If there's any warranty provided I want a replacement for it.! Or atleast to fix the problem.!,2
Though I've used it for a single day but I found an issue with the band that it's not getting charged. The charging cable which is provided with the band doesn't fit the mi 4 capsule in it. Seems like the gap is there from the sides of the holding cable. I wish they could just replace the cable rather refunding the amount but got knows what's they are gonna do as I've requested return and they are processing refund.,2
now it is working only one side,2
"In the 9th month of purchase, it stopped working. The unit stops working when power goes off..too bad!!",2
Build quality is bad. The headphones clip holding the ear pad is broken within 4 months of usage,2
The Range is very Dissapointing. My Normal USB Dongle has a better Range. I DO NOT RECOMMEND it. It is such an expensive Gadget and has a very poor Range.If I had an option to Change i would have definitely exchanged it,2
Camera quality are very poor battery are good,2

Useless product. Does not count steps correctly. Steps and calories calculations are mismatch all the time. Skipping some data on app.,2
Don't buy like this phone now a days. And now available in God phones at price,2
Product is quite good. Not satisfied with their calculation . I mean there is no accuracy in this band. And one more thing is company claim 14 days battery back . Bullshit. It die within 10 days. Not going to suggest any one to get this one at this cost.,2
Not worth the money.,2
I think it's a deffected product,2
"I am using this Bluetooth for the last 7 months, sound quality is good. A few days back support strip got broken and now it is not usable. The boat should use quality material at least for their brand image. I am trying on their customer care centre for replacement but there is no revert to calls.",2
"Gives decent speed when I am sitting right next to it. However, speed drops drastically as soon as I go to the next room.",2
"Please provide a valid email ID as all the given email IDs are invalid. I need to replace the earphones. It's wrong on your part to misguide the customer ,makes no sense in buying branded product if they give way within ten days of purchase.",2
"I just skipped the native reviews but i too faced the same problem, After replacement it's fine, ACTUALLY THIS IS THE LATEST MODEL (OCT 2020) , I bought it for 9999 but after 3rd day price reduced to 9300 , Picture quality not too good TRUST ME , Don't expect too much i saw number of monitos and in youtube reviews everyone said super but it's not , it's just good thats it",2

"according price quality fine but camera quality not good, and heating on unwanted way!",2
"Writing this after a month of use. I must say this phone has many flaws. I have over 70% of devices are from Samsung however this product is a real disappointment.

1. Finger lock mostly doesn't work (never had this problem with my oneplus phone). I made repeat registration. It simply takes 6 to 7 press to work. My other phone sensor never had this problem.
2. Pocket sensor doesn't work most of time(even after you enable it) and after every walk/cycling I see my phone showing 30-40 attempts made to open phone(even in jeans) and phone gets locked for many second.
3. Chromecast is not available for Android TV(was expecting it to be default) I need to research more but I didn't get any option for screen mirroring on Android TV
4. You don't have option of vibration with ringer option(ridiculous) you can select either of option. This one was most annoying and never expected.
5. Tap and connect feature to samsung devices are another flop show. It hardly connect.
6. Face lock is also unreliable(works 7/10)

Rest other things like battery, display quality is good.",2

Photo.... quality weast.,2
"Edit: I previously reviewed after 4 months, after 5 months, the metal part of headphone jack that goes into the phone just broke off. I called customer support and they said that is not covered under the warranty! I bought it specifically because of the warranty period. Very disappointed!

"Good Monitor for 1080p gaming under 10k. I am using this with my MacBook Pro 2016. Unfortunately this is recognised as a TV via HDMI so the display doesn't look as good as it should, especially when it comes to colour profiles. I'd look for a display with Displayport if you want to use it with a Mac. This way its recognised as an external display and not a TV. I've had this issue with 2012 rMBP too when connected to a Dell 23 inch display with HDMI. But this one is definitely better than that. One other issue is that the display wobbles. Yes its got some wobble to it which can get annoying sometimes. For gaming it'll get 5 stars. For work 3 starts. So overall 4 starts.

Note : Purchased from local seller that offered better price than Amazon surprisingly.

Update : This monitor may not support HDCP necessary for Netflix. Netflix in edge or windows 10 app will not play above 720p. I have an 8th Gen PC and connected via HDMI cable so technically there should be no problem for Netflix content, however I believe there seems to be HDCP incompatibility issues. I have tried all troubleshooting but this will not play 1080p Netflix. Even connecting a streaming stick which should technically work 100% without any problem. Still no luck.

"delivery part was good. but there should be a mechanism to check whether guds delivered are of fine quality. this is for two reasons. first n the important ; reputation and brand image creation, second ; overhead cost cutting and manhours you could save.

Today 3/6/2020 I am writing this follow-up review for this modem. There seems to be a firmware issue now. The modem signal is okay but not strong enough to connect with my laptop with Windows 10 OS and inbuilt Wi-Fi adopter. Network service provider is asking me to change this modem.

Cons. Only good in bright sunlight and can't compare with go pro.
I had bought One plus 8t phone and that camera can't becompared to it at all one plus camera is century ahead . Secondly there is no touch screen very very difficult to operate in this digital World without touch screen.

One can buy for biggeners who has ambition in photography. But touch screen should have been there.",2

Main concern for me is Sync errors.....steps and sleep monitoring are not accurate.... Purchased at 3k...looks decent for that price....but functionality is bad....,2
the product looks great and the specifications are also good on sheet. But the signal coverage is not as good as they say. i would not recommend this product. Rather would prefer other routers which are available in market.,2
Totally waste product. All sensors are not functioning properly.,2

range is normal for one floor.,2
Don't buy it a mony West product.,2
I've been using this router for quite some time and I'm not happy with the product. Not sure if I got a bad product as after reading the reviews I went ahead with this router but since that time it has been giving a lot of problem every now and then in terms of losing the signal/not able to connect with broadband internet. To verify this I tried other brand of router for my broadband settings and it works fine. The experience has been really frustrating of troubleshooting the router everytime. Looks like I got a defective piece on this and not sure what to do next.,2
"It gives better than 3 hours of backup when the power fails for my D-link wifi modem-router. The connectors provided fit properly for my modem.

"The headphones I bought weren't the best buy. A while ago they randomly malfunctioned and started screeching and bullet firing like noises started playing out of nowhere. It was pretty crazy. And the sound quality isn't amazing, neither is the fit on the ears. Your ear start aching really badly if you keep them on too long. 1500 bucks wasn't expensive so I didn't expect much, but I'm still disappointed.",2
"Good decent printer. But difficult to find replacement cartridges. Made huge mistake by buying this printer. If you doubt me, check in Amazon for HP 805 cartridge. Even HP website don't have them.

Clarity is not at par compared to cost..removing most of the sounds having > 4000Hz freq...

The accuracy is not that great.,2
Everything ok... but everytime the call cuts automatically at 4mins,2
"1. Screen quality is good
2. Navigation is satisfactory and didn't see any delay.
3. Could have storage varient of 128GB atleast.
4. RAM is 2 GB but no lag in process. Given that installing some basic apps that consume much RAM.
5. Camera quality feels like this phone doesn't have a camera. That is after using camera you will not use it anymore even for WhatsApp video call.
6. Battery backup standby is good and stands for 2 days.
7. Battery charging take more than 3 hrs which makes us keep away from using this mobile phone. Like social media distancing.
6. Heating issue occurs while making video calls for 30 minutes.",2
Sound quality is poor,2
"Earphones are good but within 8 months of purchase , sound is not coming from the left bud.",2
"After almost a month of use, I am sharing the review. The router keeps on disconnecting from the devices frequently. Even when the device is connected , it gets hanged and we need to unplug it from the cable and plug it back. The speed which I am getting through my LAN connection directly is around 80 MBPS whereas the speed through router is at max 30 MBPS. Also, the coverage is limited to 700 sq ft area.

I got the router replaced from the service center (got an old-used product even when my brand new product was malfunctioning). Still the issue is happening again.",2

"Headphones wiring quality not good, it started breaking within 2 months of use and sound quality began to diminish. Piece stopped functioning after usage of approx. 6 months",2
All good but from today it stopped working. It's been 9 months. I don't think it's a durable one. When checking about warranty they are asking to reach out to service centre which is in outskirts even in pandemic situation. One has to spend 500/- to reach the service centre,2

Range is very poor and signal keeps continously going . Would like to return this product,2
16 days that's how long they worked. 16 days. Then the wire got loose by the headset entry point. I would not recommend this product to anyone now. The price is not worth it when the product only lasts 16 days.,2

It prints 80-100 pages in very good condition. But not works after printing 100 pages. It's cartridge damages. You have to buy new cartridge . So don't buy this printer. You can buy Epson printer of cost around 7000.,2

Got it deliver scratch and box that usually received with watch is different,2
"Pro: it is lg. That's it.
Cons: the stand is fix n it cannot move so the screen is at a higher elevation n hence one may not be able to see the full screen.
2. The bezels are thick , it is poor Marketing by lg where they are missleading the customer saying boderless. It has thick inbuilt screen borders. It ruins.
3. Hdr is sub-par and it over saturates to yellowish tone. Not good.
4. It is 8 bit monitor with oversampling to 10bit to go into HDR10. Hence not good colour accuracy.
5. Not exactly 75hz, but 74.97hz. not ideal for gaming.
6. Amazon is selling it lot higher than you might get at a local store.",2
After few days it shows incoming calls for no reason.Even when there is no call coming on my phone. I want to return it . Don't buy it,2
Had ordered 2 sets in November. They worked fine only for a month. Both are useless now. Can‚Äôt hear anything through them in any device.,2
It's OK for listening music but calling poor performance of microphone and voice hearing from it while in call is poor quality.,2
"Sleep.tracker is good , however doesn't track walking properly, when I drive car, it counts the slight hand movement as walking.. won't recommend",2
"Step counting is not good. hand movements are also counted as steps. In a house where we do many things manually that also counts in steps. If steps counting is the purpose then simple good pedometer is perfect.

There is sign-in problem. Inspite of having mi account sign-up now i can't sign in. Tried many different ways but no use.",2
Processer is very slow in responding. Camera stopped working after 1 month of usage.,2

Stopped working within just one month of purchase... Bad quality delivered..,2
Wireless signal is Week and offen reboots,2
Just the brand name is with it. Neither the bass nor the sound quality. But smooth and not making ears to pain. But its not durable. Mainly the skin of the earcups,2
No base at all not worth buying this product... My suggestion dnt buy. Boat rockers 255 is better than this..,2
"Don't waste your money
Buy this only if are working out regularly.
They say if you charge it once you can use for 14 days( it's false) the battery lasts only for 3-4 days with minimum usage and the sp02 monitor does not show the results most of the time
And the watch face is not customisable, there is no Alexa.",2

Just bought this phone yesterday from Amazon.... the battery is heating up a lot....rest all is fine,2
I used real me 5 pro and seriously that was much better than this. Camera quality not good. Not fast charging.,2
They said it Bass heads...where is the Bass in it...my Ears was in pain when I listen a song for only 30 seconds....really don't expect this from BOAT...this sound you can find in 50‚Çπ rupees earphones which is sold in Indian buses and stands....This Earphone only for Nibbas-nibbis who want to talks all day... Not for listening songs üòë,2
Charging time is too late and charger also heating while charging,2
The wifi range of this 2 antenna router is very low as compared to my previous Netgear router which was without any antenna.,2
"If you are just looking a Apple look alike smart watch then go for it, but if you are hoping for fitness band along with what a good smartwatch can do then please there are better products in market.

Reviewing this after 4 weeks of use and using it for my workouts:
Fitness:: I am over weight and not a workout person. Bought this so I can feel motivated once I join gym. The watch tracks your heartbeat and steps well but that‚Äôs it. It is unable to track whether you are working out or not. The calorie count only works for the steps taken. The app is never synced with the watch and won‚Äôt show data what your watch tracks.

Touchscreen: The LCD screen of the watch will take you back in time when pixelated images and icons were the standard. The touch is not very responsive but does the work 70% of the time.

Screen: The screen has got Bazels which is not visible in the picture.

Overall a very mediocre product",2
Not as good,2
Siund quality is avg but its grip is very bad quality after 1 week of usage its totally free so keeps falling from ear so not recommended,2

"The unit after 2 weeks of installation started misbehaving it would drop speed to 35 Kbps fromm1.5mbps

Have to get it replaced",2
I like the product and trust Amazon,2
No installation instructions and No CD is available for Drivers installation... Still trying to download if not so I can cancelled it,2
"The accuracy of the tracker is not good. It overestimates the step counting, heart rate, BP etc.
The heart rate doesn't show an elevated level even if you do HIIT or doesn't come doen if you take complete rest.",2
"It is a honest review.
When I received this product, I found that left ear bud making more sound than right. I think it may be Petron theory of sound so I didn't bother from it.
But after three days these earphones stop functioning it get connected to Bluetooth but not making any sound.
I made a replacement immediately. Today when I got a replacement product and found that they really have a great sound compare to what I got before. There is no low high sound on left or right. bass is also good.
So please be aware of it. Seller may sometimes send you duplicate product.
It was my luck that it got malfunction in the return period .",2
"Camera,battery,speed is not good as expected.screen flashes automatically.no notification led as note5.",2

"So many disappointing reviews from my colleagues, currently fighting for replacement of 3 products. In my product left speaker keeps giving sounds of loose screw/part inside, even after replacement.

"The build quality of product is worst .within 2 months of use one side of the earphone is not working.
I strongly recommend all of you not to buy this product.",2
Not worth it. Isn't powerfull when compared to other 300mbps routers. It gets the job done but not to a point where it is satisfactory.,2
Dislik camera quality not good,2
An okayish router overall and VFM. One serious issue is WiFi signal. I barely get a single point of WiFi signal even in the next room. I use this router 24/7 and I am facing frequent disconnects and poor WiFi signal. D-Link is better than this one. Also the LED lights are so dim and they are barely visible as well as bring poorly positioned.,2
For extension of WiFi range it has to be physically connected to the original router. Will not extend through WiFi signal.,2
"Low speed charging ....
It's take 3,4 hours",2
"Hi,
I bought JBL C50HI in-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black) on may 13th but now Ear phone mike is not working , and it is in under warranty period please confirm how to resolve my problem.",2
It's good but not best,2
Just okay,2
"I purchased this to use with my laptop for web conferences. More often than not I can hear others, but they cant hear me at all. I tried using wired mode, changed settings on the laptop, but nothing seems to help. Even when test calls show things working, when I get on an actual call, it is the same ""we cant hear you"" issue. This is supposed to be a headset with mic but is functioning more like a headphone.",2
Product is ok but not good,2
it is not working as mentioned in its feature.Most usual problem is pairing. it is seven days since I purchased but pairing not accurate. most of time it disconnect automatically.Worst experience.Recomend not to purchase.,2
"hardware is fine, but contains a lot of junk and ads. Getting irritated seeing those ads.",2
"First time i started the watch, i was in shock because of display. My older fitbit had a better ppi than this watch. The touch screen reminds me of first generation of android mobile with resistive touch screen, you need to tap hard for it to work. The app just disconnects from the watch and you have to restart the app to sync and have music control back",2
"The product was good with good sound, bass, and Bluetooth connectivity. However, one side got broken only after 6-7 months of normal usage.",2
So so...,2
Incoming call issue.. I the incoming voice was distorted. I got replaced but I was facing same issue.,2
Printer print quality is very low,2
"The only button on the earphone does not work properly it did for some days but now it does not.
I have to press it very hard to make it work but somertimes even that does not work.
Except that sound quality is real good
Recommended just check the button",2
Doesn‚Äôt cover even 10 meters ! No point buying this .. I am not satisfied at all,2
to whom we have to approach? what about warranty and others? please guide,2
"changing my earlier review from 4 to 2 star.. nice innovation, but the battery didn't last over a year.
So after a year of use, the product is useless.

There is no option to open the device, until unless u decide to force open it,

If you turn the UPS mode off, even the battery will not be charging. you always need to keep the UPS mode.
This product should have 3 modes,
a. Bypass (passing the power as it is to router)
b. UPS off, capable of charging battery till its full
c. UPS on mode.",2
It just had 4 huge antennas. But the Wifi is terrible.,2
"Worst earphones, NO NOISE CANCELLATION, NO BASS , Sound quality is very poor, build quality also very poor, mi basic is better than this at this price range@400. If u have budget around 500 , better to buy Boult audio loupe earphones. I have actually buyed this on seeing the brand boat ,but it doesn't deserve it. Overall rating is 5/10. It works like rs.100 earphones and if u compare with mi basic earphones, mi basic are the best in all rounder. please don't buy it, At this price range many other earphones are there .",2
"I purchased only for monitoring of BP, Blood oxygen and Heart rate. HR is marching with medical equipment however BP and blood oxygen not performing accuracy. Spending of money on this device for medical purpose is wastage of money.",2
"After 3 months of use, it stopped working due to technical fault. After several calls to toll free number,It is not being attended. Many emails sent, but no response so far.I am feeling helpless. I would not recommend anyones to buy to-link product as the product is not sturdy and warranty is immaterial due to worst after sale service.",2
Sound quality was not as expected. Bass was too high. Totally dissapointed. Wish I could return it. But amazon has no return policy,2
"ink cartridge not good,i print 20 pic of pepper of one cartridge",2
I owned a similar model earlier ..and wanted To buy a similar headphones from Sony. But was seriously disappointed by the bass quality and overall sound quality. Suggest people should buy Sony headphones with xtra Bass feature.,2
Plz help me router 1 hour me automatically restart ho raha he kya karu........ replacement ho sakta he kya....2 din hue he lekar.....,2
Good ...but small cartridge and cost of the ink is very high,2

Sometime its disconnect automatically and some times it doesn't connect at all.,2
Very bad phone heating problem is their in the phone,2
Sound quality from Sony not at all expected. It looks like a duplicate item.,2
"The app does not register users account.
Instruction s are incorrect. Whereas WiFi is available easily, range is weak.

The processor is quite slow,2
Range is very low not satisfied,2
"Phone has good looks, sufficient specs but works very slow and somewhat equivalent to 512 mb ram old phone, after touching any icon when no app running in background takes 3 seconds min to respond. And this is after updating it to latest. Customer care not responded to email even after asking for any update which can solve this problem. Quality that has been delivered was not expected from brand like panansonic.",2
"Do NOT buy if are programmer. Texts are highly pixelated. Screen is too bright for eyes at its lowest brightness setting.

"Not work properly after 4 months,",2
"was using very age old product called ‚ÄúLInksys wrt54g‚Äù which offers only 802.11 a,b,g networks with a speed of 54 Mbps.
My internet connection is much faster than this linksys maximum speed. so, i had to look for alternative.
then i found this product.
Pros:
1. Offers dual band ( 2.5GHZ and 5 GHZ )
2. offers latest 802.11 ac also which is latest technology
3. Offers upto a speed of 300 Mbps which is good fit for my internet connection.

Cons:
1. Even though 802.11 AC is offered by this product your devices are supposed to be compatible with this.
2. One glitch i found in this was: My internet provider is ACT and i am supposed to login with username and password. One of the good feature with this product is Wireless router automatically submits username/password on PPPoE connection. But frequent disconnections happening on this mode. earlier with Linksys WRT54G, i used to put it in manual mode so that whenever i connect to wireless and if connection isn‚Äôt active, browser used to redirect me to login page of ACT. But with this product, i found it‚Äôs not getting redirected and most of the time i used to manually disconnect and connect to WAN connection. which is annoying.. This might be an issue in the product. it might have been fixed in latest firmware or releases. let me check that too.

after using 1 month, the glitch above was keep annoying me and it‚Äôs too frustrated.. hence i made a modification to this review and gave 2 points now.",2
"The efficiency of one catriges is 50 pages.
It's very slow to print a single page.",2
"Competent printer, works as advertised. Difficult install. Starter cartridge of black ink lasted exactly 35 pages. For that reason alone, i will no longer buy HP products. Epson, Brother, etc. don't cheat consumers like this. Black cartridge costs Rs 850 to buy. I will be refilling, for sure.",2
"Too scratchy and glass of my mi band 4 has cracked so easily
sleep tracking is a average and mobile app is good",2
"Good for music lovers. Bass, sound quality and noice cancellation r good but the problem is with its auto connection. When you don't play any music, then it'll automatically disconnects and again reconnects randomly again and again, and this is annoying. That's why I returned this product.",2
"After many research i purchased LG screen and i thought it'll be good vcoz i have 1 already.
Bt in this 22MP68VQ (Right side in photos) 1. has awkward things not adjusted screen auto pr manually so edges of the screen are cut.
2. Awkward yellow colortone which i never have in same LG brand other monitor and it's not even adjust after many setting.
3. It has ips display same has i have other bt this has screen bleeding issues.
4. Not good for video editing or animation work bcoz extra yellow color can change ur whole videos color.
Other thn that it's good for regular usage if edges are not cut.",2
The charger was very loose when ever i use to charge my watch it automatically comes out of the charger. There is a volume control issu the volume is not adjusting by the watch.,2
"Not getting notifications of social apps like wassapp , facebook , gmail etc.

On replacement i have got used watch strap.",2
"Product is not bad but not very good.
I buy but the band is bend and one sideed band is given , the band defect is for me not for all products. You can check my uploaded photo .",2
"The printer is not useful unless you going to print 5 or 10 pages a month
Pros-
Print quality is good
Easy to install
Cons-
The ink is very expensive , the first time we have printer around 30 or 40 pages then we had to buy a black ink catridge which is around 750
When printing in bulk it does not print the pages correctly, eg if I give page 15 to 20, it prints some random pages like13, 17 and all
Paper feeding mechanism is not that good, you may have to keep adjusting it",2
"Quality is superb in this price range. But I have rated bad just because of the signal range and dropping the signal outside the room.
Inside the room it‚Äôs working well but not good for outside the room. It‚Äôs work only for a single room.",2
Worst experience Personally I don‚Äôt like this product because of pricing issue now this time we got,2
The phone is not worth the money. Realme phones are way better. You need not to waste money.,2
Selfy camera is not good .,2
"After using oppo A31 a week , I'm totally disappointed as phone getting switched off randomly 4-5 times . It was frustrating when I'm in my regular field work entering my client details and all , and then suddenly phone gets switched off.",2
It is very difficult to use the courtuge,2
my netgear router without external attena would give better output than this one.I went for D- Link brand. So sorry.,2
I wish I could give its durability 0 stars stopped working after 9 months.Well the earphones were good while they lasted but if they are going to become faulty after such a little time then it's best not to buy them. I tried but could not claim the warranty I would suggest to buy them from a a electronics store instead of buying them online because they do take responsibility.,2
Accuracy is poor and battery life is about 7 days .,2
You will regret like i am after purchasing go for honor band 5 after update its best. Now the worst part with mi band 4 is accuracy and charging,2
Mi band 5 and mi band 4 is only a few things are different.,2
"The product is defective, it is not working. And user manual is not provided.",2
Wi-Fi range is not good,2
"If you are planning to use it on repeater mode to amplify wifi range make sure your main wifi router is from Tenda, for my case my main router is TP link so, Tenda is mit compatible with TP-link for repeater mode.",2
I bought 12V variant in Jan 2021 and it stopped working just in 3 months.,2
The sound was very feable.,2
Sound quality and bass quality average but whats the worst part is they are not comfortable at all. U can barely wear it for 20 minutes. Not worth the price instead i would go for other alternatives.,2
Item looks good but it is a defect one,2
Not easy operation calibration sometime lagging.,2
"This printer works well initially but after 1 year of use it gives me so much headache. Paper gets jammed all the time and lines appear when printed in colour.
Don't buy this printer if you don't want headache.",2
i want replacement,2
Sir On site warenty hai kya 1year ke,2
The sound quality is superb... only thing is the right one has stopped working rught after seven months which is not at all acceptable and expected from jbl! Think before you buy these or even the others from jbl since one of my friend also faced the same problem again and again,2
"Colors, battery life, display are all great. But the key purpose of accurately tracking steps and sleep time is lost in trying to provide the decorative features",2
"The range is worst
The speed doesnt cross 20 MBPS on my Hathway cable connection which itself is 50MBPS
its advertised as 300mpbs router , but its not good at all.",2
Nice sound quality but poor life... Not working after 2-3 months....now I'm looking for a good headphone in higher price range.,2
It s not the gud,2
"It cannot take load..even basic operations sometimes crash the system..lag and buffering becomes part of your routine, so forget about speed or light gaming if had that in mind.
I have been using it for 10 months so I know what I'm saying.
And believe when I say that it's performance has only deteriorated ever since its arrival.
The body is plastic so the hinges give creeks after some time..",2
"make sure before buying check their policy, as this item they don't accept for return, As per price you have to think well before, the earphone is nice but not too nice.",2
"The printer is not as user friendly as claimed. Event after following all the prompted actions, it encountered problems while connecting through HP app on IOS. With much effort, the printer finally started but still did not receive print command from mobiles. Had to connect to PC using USB for printing. So much for dual band direct WIFI feature. Will update review after using it for a month or two.",2
This product is not value for money. Not worth at all.,2
connectivity and range is an issue. does not transmit the required speed,2
Heart rate or steps is not accurate,2
Don't buy this product waste of your money. Blue tooth connection very poor.,2
"Bought this product to serve the purpose of less hassle with wires and better neck movement while playing. The latency in sound is annoying and doesn't support mobile gaming.
Sound quality isn't market standard. Doesn't live upto the hype. Pretty average for a brand that promises too much.",2
"The monitor stand is absolutely rigid. It cannot be adjusted for eyelevel or viewing angle at all.
The product says bezel less - because glass reaches nearly till end of the monitor but it has half a inch thick dead pixel boundary all around - so definitely not bezel less.",2
The range of the router is not as expected. The wifi gets very slower even a little far from the router,2
It's k but sometimes hangover,2
Battery is very weak,2
It is very very slow!!! Every appliaction takes ages to open.,2
don't buy this product it broken within 5 days of usage and I couldn't able to return this. the build quality is very very poor pls don't buy this headphones.now I have to find a solution to join the broken part.,2

"Bass is too bad, i can't think, it's a average product, not bad overall",2
"Received a damaged watch and an open packet and and unsealed box as well.
Not happy with the product conduction.",2
"This is a very good and compact printer to use. But once the OEM cartridge becomes empty, getting the 805 replacement cartridge is very difficult. I ordered the 805 cartridge in amazon, but received a wrong 803 cartridge. So, I ordered the ink refill from amazon and is running fine.

Other than that this is a very good printer for home use.",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I‚Äôm Not Satisfied With this Product.Very Bad Product. It‚Äôs restarting automatically,I was Already Replaced To this Product But Problem was Same In These Phones.",2
WiFi speed drops gradually. After restart it improves. Previously had Cisco which never gave this kind of issues,2
The phone doesn't open once the battery drains to 0. Charging doesn't help. This doesn't open at all.,2
WiFi signal covers very short.,2
Phone and Battery getting over heated,2
Even simple back cover not available on the box. It was available when I purchase redmi note8 in February.,2
Overal quality is good,2
it was tight to wear. We requested seller and Amazon to return it but no results. Be sure of size before buying it,2
"Slow processing, heating problem",2
Mic does not work if in-line control button is not presses continuously. So your one hand is always busy.,2
"Less bass,,,,,need to improve more quality.",2
"Pros:The only good thing about the product is its price..its a good deal under 1000 bucks..
Cons: its look really dull and dirty after few days..very hard to clean it even with a cloth
Despite of having 2 antennas the reach of wifi connectivity is quite poor..u hv to come really close to the router if u actually want to browse or download something",2
"The product is good for small house/area.
As the wifi range is short its better not buy if you have bigger house.",2
Noise cancellation bahut jayda h awaj nahi aati h,2
üëç,2
Didn't expect this quality from sony. Worst sound quality.. even a 150 rs headphone does the job in a good way.,2
Jack is not fitting properly in 3.5 mm jack devices,2

"I made a mistake buying this product without paying attention to the return policy. Apparently it can only be replaced so there goes my money!

Major con: My audio sounds horrible to the other person on the call. Not at all fit for wfh use.",2
Good for price.But catidge is poor ink for print 10 A4 only.Scaner is good worker,2
"I purchased this hoping that 4 antennas would provide very good coverage to all corners but unfortunately in my 900 SQ Ft 3 BHK flat , when you close the door of room or sitting in a corner, you get very less signal. I had to spend on installtion to a corridor where from all areas could get fair signals. It is better to but old models with one or two antennas as dual band and 4 antennas are just a marketing gimmick.",2
"I have received a defective phone.
The issue is on the display,bottom part of the display is yellowish,but Amazon arranged me a replacement.so im happy with the service, waiting for my replacement order.",2
"The sound quality is good, but the ear cover is so tight I cannot be wear for more than 30 munites. When I connect bthe aux cable with my phone, my phone started misbehave, automatically sounds goes high and low, google assistant automatically got opened, and lagging my phone .",2
"Bakbass laptop, mat Lena",2
"‚Ä¢ The headphone's battery is good but the major drawback is when it's battery is 50% or little bit less there is this irritating sound which plays continuously after every 10 seconds. Basically you can't play anything because of the sound.
‚Ä¢ These headphones don't have best bass sound.
‚Ä¢ Sound quality is good but before buying just keep in mind about the sound which will be a loy irritating",2
"Not as good as it could be. I use it as extended monitor for my laptop for coding. You can see the pixels at curves for letters.
Although it as ambiance sensor in place but that doesn't optimize brightness to ease your eveys.

It my fit for light for some work when you are not required to be focused on the screen for longer duration",2
"Purchased this product over a month ago, during the last sale. The produce was well packaged and delivered promptly. Installation took a while, especially if you don't have a CD-drive and have to install from the web. After installation thought, it is very easy to use. However, after a month's use and about 35 pages of print, the laptop stopped color prints while color prints from the mobile gave yellow printouts.
The customer service was the worst, even after over an hour of staying on calls, they werent able to solve either of the issues. I was able to solve the laptop issue by reinstalling all drivers manually, which took some time. A complaint was finally raised to send a technician for a site visit. The tech person came after a couple of days, tried the same steps but couldn't solve. Per the technician, the red color nozzle had dried out and this is common in inkjet printers if not used every 3 days!!",2
Per page printing is Too much costly,2
"Pros :
Easy to install both in extender mode and modem mode
Good wifi signal
Cons :
Sometimes you need to reset every few weeks
Signal is strong but speed is very slow (I have a 200 Mbps connection , connecting to it gives me 20 Mbps to 30 Mbps max )

Buy it if you dont have budget to get some good routers",2
"While on the call , surrounding sound is heard to caller.",2
The product started malfunctioning after 1.5 years. And after 1 year 10 months the box gave up. The diaphragm is damaged now and I have no clue what to do with it now. Bad experience with Philips. üôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅ,2

The product delivered is not working at all so what should I do and I have also raised a replacement request and the pick up time which I opted was 8 to11 am and nobody to pick it up.,2
Worst ever music system just in a month it's 2 satellite audio Jack's got bad. Now i have to carry it to service centres and i dont know what kind of service they provide. Not recommended highly.,2
This product are not good . Please don't buy . Because this automatic mode change . without change . When running. This is a verry bad issue in manufacturing.,2
"Works just fine. Sensors are bit poor, had to move hand hard to get the time. Not recommended.",2
Total trash and waste of money. Half of the advertised features dont even work.,2
Basic product with average performance.Can be used for basic usage. Camera quality is really bad. Display is good.,2
With this price it does not have compass to navigate which makes some apps unable to use. Like sky watch. So disappointing. Even smart phone which cost around rs.6000 does have it.,2
Had very bad experience.. Microphone and speaker is not working properly.. Hanging problem.. Signal reception is very poor than other mobiles..,2
"Battery life very low,I",2
Worst battery.it takes 3.5 to 4 hour to full charge and battery drains very fast.dont recommend to anyone .No value for money.,2

Display is good. Camera is not upto the mark. When taking video both sound and video are not in sync. Battery is getting drained off so quickly. For a video of 4 mins battery driained from 78% to 66%. For 11 mins usage battery drained off from 66% to 64% with WIFi On. But not used any kind of internet consuming application. Just done some navigation in the phone. Software is not tested properly as there are lot of graphical glitches while using the phone. Hope in next UI update it will be fixed.",2
After 3 month it hasn‚Äôt worked for me.Can you please tell me from where I can change this as it still in the warranty,2
Purchased in Jan 2019. Initial 5 months headset was good. 6-8 months could sense dip in sound quality. 9th month headset is almost out. Sound keeps fluctuating. Customer care not responsive.,2
"Giving only 2 star just because of poor pin quality. Pin got broken very quickly. Sound quality, noise cancellation and bass looks fine. But pin is very fragile and broken within 2 months.",2
It is ok for a use and throw piece. The end part with the metal spring does not work as it should work. It is not fragile. Not suitable as per the price.,2

"Okay Product
I checked reviews before buying but I am getting only 1 signal in my 3rd Room. Reviews said it gives full signal in 3rd Room of 3 BHK but in my room I am getting a weak Signal. For downloading or proper use of Facebook or WhatsApp I have to go in other rooms or Dining Hall.
For me it's Okay.",2
"Nice product, but software connectivity problem",2
Went down within month.. hardware is not reliable though I had good WiFi signal,2

Overall really nice tracker. This is my third mi band and I was really satisfied with the product however after using it for just 6 month the battery backup has dropped to less than 5 day which is really worst.,2
"Software problem
Restart automatically",2
Doesn't perform any better than a 2k router and a big waste for domestic purpose.,2
"The microphone & sound quality is not as per the expectations.

We wanted to replace this with other product but Amazon didn't allow us, they are forcing the replacement with same product.

We weren't aware of this else would have never bought this from Amazon.

This recent change in return policy is not proper.",2
Waste of money. Half of the features mentioned are not working as expected. It will not track you sleep daily or even wont show continuous o2 or heart-rate properly. Very disappointed,2
"Finger print and power button are same. So If my intention is just to see the push notification by clicking the power button but actually unlocking my phone due to finger print sensor.

Camera quality is very very bad. Not preferred to go if someone one expects good camera quality.

If playing games or on torchlight back side too much heat is generating.",2
Damaged screen received,2
It short circuited in just in 4 months. Better buy a branded monitor.,2
"Sound quality is not good as expected , i have ordered 2 pieces 1 is black & other is red , red is performing really well , but the sound quality on black one is too poor",2
"Good product, but extremely expensive printing cost. The cartridge got over after 45-50 pages.. and each crateisge cost about 1000 rs.. I wish hp make a more efficient model..",2
Poor print quality and paper jam issue. Paper handelling is very poor.,2
Hanging and too slow,2
Actually after 50 days my headphone is not working.It is not taking charge and please reply me what i do now,2
"The quality of the earphones was very good especially the noise cancellation. But in less than 3 months the right ear piece stopped working. Very dissapointed. I was expecting it to work for at least 6 months given the price and quality but that didn't happen. Really wasn't expecting this from JBL. Would have given it a single star but as I mentioned earlier, on initial usage the sound quality was fantastic.",2
"The product is not packed by amazon
Cd is not available
I face many problem to install
But print quality is good",2
"For some reason, the device does not track sleep activity before midnight. If I sleep from 10 pm to 5 am, the device only recognizes sleep activity from midnight to 5 am. 10 pm to midnight does not register. Therefore, one of the main purposes behind my purchasing the device has been thwarted. Disappointed.",2
"1) No sync with Google fit
2) Poor or low-quality strap
3) Useless sleep tracking - 90% incorrect tracking

Failing to meet the above makes it unworthy to buy. Disappointed. I hope they can fix it in future updates.",2
"Need to press thrice every time for fingerprint, battery is OK camera is good",2
Battery backup is not good. 100%battery goes nil after using 2 hours of continue watching movie.,2
"Phone is a decent one, it has average camera and its display is relatively good for 720P since it's a s.amoled. I have noticed whenever I try to open the folder on the extreme end by any thumb, the touch doesn't get sensed, instead I have to press directly on the folder icon by the other thumb, I don't know what's the reason behind this. Apart from this software is good, but I hate the way bloatwares are been added and there is no option to uninstall Netflix or some apps. Even to torcher the user, there is automatic download of mojo app and some useless apps, hence u have to stop the auto install and other app features on galaxy store. The most concerned thing is we don't have always display on feature and the carrier aggregation. Unfortunately even the Samsung helpdesk doesn't know that this feature is not available in this phone. There are many minor issues which samsung has to fix with updates if they decide to do it. To the given price I personally had expected better from samsung, but it's just ok. If they update the software patch it would be a good phone.",2
This router tends to stall for 3-4 times every day. I nned to restart it whenever this happens. Not a good buy.,2
"Pairing the device is a big challenge. Within three days i installed the app 10 times.

Also the notifications are not happening all times.

I was not happy, but Amazon is saying we can only exchange the product. If the customer is not happy, then u should take back the product. Don't insist him to use it once again the same new one.

First impression is the best impression",2
Fm not play clear,2
Low bass effects,2
There's no bass control..... Bass is very very poor.... Not satisfied at all... There's no return option as well... Only replacement option is available... Got it replaced as well... But the new one delivered is also with poor bass...,2
In this phone camera quality is not good but bettery backup is good,2
I was totally unsatisfied by product YOUTUBE FACE BOOK not running smoothly every aspect was damn bad.I am going to return it by tomorrow.,2
"I bought this router last year to replace my DLInk Dir 650 router that was working fine but had limited range making it difficult to get the signal in the rooms at the other end of flat.

I selected ARcher C7 after seeing high praise for it on NY Times and other technology sites.

I use it connect to my DSL router: it has dual bands (2.4 and 5 Mhz), three antennas, thus providing strong signal across the flat. It also comes with two USB-2 ports which can be used to connect external drive and printer, thus making it file and printer server as well. Technically it can provide 1750 mbps connectivity with ability to connect multiple devices to Internet

However, this turned out to be most frustrating router I've ever used. It keeps dropping wireless connection several times a day, though wired connections keep working fine. Usually turning it off and on works. Sometimes, I''ve to turn both (DSL and Wireless) routers to get wireless connectivity again. This seems to be usual problem with this router. Forums on TP-Link and other sites offer several solutions such as, disabling hardware NAT, using only 2.4 mhz band, updating firmware to latest version, etc. I've tried all those, but none of them provided relief.

Not sure if it is problem with Archer C7 model V2 which was supplied here in India, but it's very frustrating and irritating experience, specially when wireless signal is lost during doing online train booking or banking transaction.

With my old DIr-650 router I rarely lost the wireless connection, but with this pricey-shiny-router I barely can keep wireless connection. Finally, I switched back to the old router. I do not have the range of Archer C7, but I bot back my peace of mind.

Overall a frustrating technology marvel not worth the price.",2
"This worked great while it was working. It gave me a good service for 2 years. After that it abruptly stopped working - it's just a black paperweight now. I needed it only for a few minutes while my DG backup kicks in. I had bought it for 1500 a couple of years ago - now they have increased the price to 2000. The same thing is available on international websites for lesser - and they all ship from China. These guys are just branding the same product with their name and selling it - which is fine, but quality has gone for a toss.",2
Signal always get lost,2
"The step tracking is highly inaccurate , the steps counted and distance covered is less than 50 percentage compared to actuals. The sleep tracking is also inaccurate, sleep time shown is nearly 25-30 percentage less. It is rather surprising that mi band 5 is getting glowing reviews inspite of being accurate. Honor band 5 is more accurate compared to mi band 5.",2

"Though it's a in-ear headphone, it slips from ears. The silicone doesn't grips the ears for long time or during normal movements like walking etc.

 This device is utter Garbage, I have bought this watch the day it was released on Amazon,

Just after 2 days of using it,
I realized the wrist awake feature is worthless, does not sense proper movement,

Then the Spo2 monitor is also highly inaccurate, it is supposed to have COUNTINIIUS tracking but in reality it hardly even does, the entire day the stress meter did not record anything,

Now connectivity issue, every 15-20 min the watch will get disconnected from my phone's Bluetooth for some unknown reason (I literally have no idea why) i have tried all troubleshooting steps and nothing has worked,

The watch faces - this watch has literally 20 wallpaper and you gotta select only from that, then there's cloud based wallpaper, which is just cleaver marketing technique it will store only one wallpaper that too with out any change of theme or any kind of customization.

4k is the price i paid and i repent it deeply.

Do not
I repeat DO NOT buy this watch",2

Not suitable for online gaming with gaming consoles.

If someone is looking for more than 90Mbps speed then this is not the right choice. Netgear AC1200 can handle that consistently.",2

"I received this router last week which is also known as AX50. I was overexcited of getting WiFi 6 router. I overlooked some review on amazon about how it heats up when placed on flat surface and ordered myself as I needed a gigabyte router and thought to invest in the new technology. So far I can summarize some of the issues I came across on this router (I have around 10 Tp-link routers at this point, from cheapest to N to dual band.)

1. It does heat up considerably from top and bottom middle portion. If I have to keep this router and no firmware can fix this, you have to install a PC cabinet fan under it to help remove the heat.
2. This router doesn't provide Bridging/WDS functionality that all other routers that I have from tp-link has. Very disappointed as this functionality is present even in the least expensive tp-link router.
3. The range of 2.4 GHz is no better than cheapest tp-link single band dual antenna that cost around 1000 rs has so disappointed with 2.4GHz WiFi performance.
4. 5 GHz band is as usual have short range. The 5 GHz AC can connect to any device with a maximum of 1200 Mbps link speed, even if supported WiFi adapter maximum speed is higher to 1200mbps. If only AX mode is selected, router can connect to AX device to maximum of 2400 Mbps but it will not run AC mode. With mix mode with AC and AX, the maximum connection speed reduces to 1200 Mbps even for AX devices. So, this router is called AX router with 2400 Mbps for 5GHz or a AX router with 1200 Mbps that can connect to AC devices too, so it is misleading on part of TP-link. I shared the same on their forum but no response from their representative.
5. Channel numbers for each band seems to change from those set in the admin configuration page after few session so if any bridge router connected to this AX router, it will disconnect.
6. Ethernet Gigabit ports is maxing out at around 750 mbps read and 350 mbps write speed. I used CAT 7 cable to test the speed in my internal network. With a gigabit switch, I can get around 900mbps read and 600mbps write. Disappointed here too.
7. AC wifi is maxing out at 22 MBps and 45 MBps in the internal network test. This is disappointing result as this results is what I can get with older tp-link C5 router.
8. With Intel AX200NGW wifi 6 160 MHz adapter, I could connect to the router with 2400 Gbps connection.
9. This router doesn't support tp-link OneMesh functionality which allow to connect other router to form a internet mesh to avoid wifi deadspots in home or office.

For configurations, I have disabled Airtime Fairness and OFDMA. I have enabled MU-MIMO as my laptop Killer's wifi adapter 1550i supports it. Smart connect is disconnected. One ethernet and 2 wlan devices are connected to the router. AX functionality is not yet tested as I still have to install Intel's wifi 6 AX200NGW adapter to my laptop. Router is running on new firmware as mentioned in the details.

I did some test to get AX performance of the router. I enabled OFDMA, from 20 MHz till 160 MHz and MU MIMO functions for 5 GHz band and did all test with wifi router 1feet from the laptop equipped with Intel AX200NGW 160MHz wifi adapter. The test was done using Synology Diskstation connected to the router Gigabit port. Diskstation is capable of read and write of over 800 Mbps.
Channel number 120 (DFS) Below is the test results:

20MHz - Writing 98.33 Mbps reading 166.51 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 287 Mbps
40MHz - Writing 125 Mbps reading 250 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 574 Mbps
80MHz - Writing 180 Mbps reading 350 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 1200 Mbps
160MHz - Writing 165 Mbps reading 370 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 1200 Mbps
160MHz - Writing 190 Mbps reading 400 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 2400 Mbps

Further I tested the USB 3.0 speed by connecting a Lexar Triton USB 3 with maximum speed 170 read and 170 write speed. I got no more than 15 MBps in write and 25 MBps in read when router was connected with 2400 Mbps speed. The result of these transfer is again disappointing .

Other star attraction feature of QoS and parental control won't work if you have no tp-link id and internet connection. For this id, you have to give personal information and potential risk of direct connection of this router to some Chinese company which, if they want, they can access all of your devices connected to this router.

In view of my observations since last 2 days and several test as mentioned above, I believe that this router is not worth the money spend.
Bridging/WDS function removed and AX band and USB 3 actual transfer rate as well as 2.4 GHz range are mediocre at best. Heat generation is another big issue to the longevity of the device.",2

The product does not come even close to my earlier D-link 150mbps router in terms of the range. Don't fall the 3 antennas they are pretty much useless. Instead buy dlink 150 or 300mbps. Atleast you will get nice range. By the my house is big 3bhk. I kept the router in the center of my house. But the range is very poor. Also wired connectivity is also poor. Don't buy. Probably going to purchase a new one.,2

 This laptop sucks even for basic use like video watching and ms office (it doesn't come with ms office you have to buy it or download pirated version). If you are on a tight budget, you can buy this and then install a ssd and aditional 4 gb ram stick to make it usable. Heats quite a bit after 30 mins of continuous usage. Integrated graphics reserve around 800 MB of ram due to which only 3.4 GB of ram is usable. So an additional ram stick is must. Dual core processor is on the weaker side, fans get ramped up quite a bit which is annoying.
The only pro i can think of is the screen quality which is decent according to the price(note that brand has cut corners to give full hd panel at this price). If you are a programmer stay away from this machine and build a PC(you can build a great PC at 25k).",2

this product broked very easily like when i buyed it after 15-20 days the right side band is cracking little bit then afterwards it fully cracked the build quality is very poor but product is awesome due to build quality i wont recommend you to buy it,2
High cost of print because inck is expensive,2
Buttons are not working,2
Camera quality is too bad.. waste of money on buying it,2
Biggest drawback - No display. Better one is L4160. One need to remember how many time copy button has been pressed to know the count of photocopy. Setting up wireless was time consuming and difficult. Remember don't plug USB cable if u want to set up wireless connection. Print quality is good for documents but for picture it's poor. Speed is OK. Price per print out is inexpensive (USP). I think it would be better to buy laser printer in this price. My previous printer was of rs 7500 was better than this in all aspect except it did not have wireless and price per print out was expensive.,2

"I purchased this headset at a very good price of 499. I needed a BT headset for my official skype meetings and this looked like a good low cost option to me.

After going through 2 iterations of this product (1st was replaced) I am constrained to say it is better to avoid this unless of course your requirements are only limited to taking phone calls on the mobile.

Positives first...
* Is very cost effective
* Comes ready to use, right off the bat; no hassles pairing, pre-charged
* Very thoughtfully provides you an additional pair of those silicon/rubber ear muffs (whatever they are called) for the buds

So what's wrong? Pretty much everything else. Here's my take...
* Has 0 bass and sometimes sounds pretty tiny/hollow
* Has inconsistent quality. The first set will not work properly (wont carry my voice on a call) whether paired to a laptop or a phone. Had to return for a replacement
* Second one could pair and work with the phone. However quality of sound was debatable. Definitely not for listening to music
* Biggest challenge was with my laptop and skype calls. This was the whole reason for buying this device. My tech support team spent much time to figure out the issue. While it paired with the laptop initially the mic will not work at all. Later they figured out the sound coming through the mic was so low that the laptop was not detecting the input and switching over to the laptop mic. So even after they forced the laptop to only use only headset mic the person at the other end just could not hear almost anything! It was almost as if the mic was covered by something!

Net bottomline... This headset is of barely any use unless you need a headset on a low budget and your only expectation is to make phone calls. Otherwise just AVOID!!!

Footnote: I wonder what those 37% people who gave it 5 star rating were really smoking! Or was theire expectation so low that a mere pairing of the headset with their phone made them so gleeful... will never know!",2
"Having used this for more than a month, i can clearly say that it is not worth the price. The bass is terribly bad. Good for taking calls but not for listening to music. The only positive is the battery life.",2
"If built quality is your one of your priorities then don't go for it, built quality is like 50 rs Chinese products. Expected a bit more at this price. Sounds well, bass well but while playing pubg it doesn't work good. In pubg you barely hear the enemies footsteps. Noise cancelling is not that great but not even too bad ü•¥. After all it's your call.",2
This product details said there is a earphone and screen protector. But i didnt get that,2
Looking is very bad,2
"Don't buy this product,cause mobile full heat after u use 30mnt and services worste cause when I'm call they r recive n told do like that like this don't use what they say, really my mobile Full heat so don't replace my mobile",2
"Not sure how this product got such a good rating. I walked around the house, doing some household stuff, for last 5-10 minutes wearing this watch.. It showed no increase in the feet count. Then I briskly moved my hand front/back for 10 seconds - it immediately showed 10 ft increase. Wav! I checked wearing another brand's watch on my other hand at the same time for testing. This watch fared very poorly. My simple mobile does better tracking. This watch is an useless product, so better avoid it.",2

Poor Quality.,2
More ink loss n money loss,2
"When I purchased, for few month it was having a good quality sound, but latest quality detoriated and my ear started to pain. Then mic stopped working.
Very much disappointed by the quality from brand like this.",2
This is not likely good. This phone doesn't have many features that other redmi phone (below this too) have. Split screen not supported and many many disadvantages.,2
"Bluetooth problm.. Disconnected every 2 to 3 minutes
Not recommend",2
"Not as expected
Cannot change the watch face
Mobile app is horrible
Touchscreen is good",2
This product I available cheaper on the gonoise store.... also if you bind it once on the app then you cannot unbind it and use it on another phone.... it is a problem even if your phone is updated....,2
The sound quality is ok....There is nothing like noise cancellation in this product....the bass quality is very poor...,2
"Bluetooth connection very bad and
time accuracy also not well

Not happy with the product (Noise Smart Watch)",2
It's does not have smart tracking features that very disappointed.,2
"Actually i didn't like very bad experience.
My friend took this he referred me this product",2
"Vocal quality akdam bakwas , no instrument music . Bass it's ok but not impressive after full volume sound breaking.
HD sound 1/5
Call quality microphone 2/5
Battery 4/5
Build quality 3/5
Bluetooth 3/5
Usb /aux cable quality 0/5
Melody music you can't listen with this headphone . Don't buy . Not return policy only repleshment. Matlab your money dump. All over sound quality like cheaper headphone it's called pure chaina headphone . Go for sony and other brand. I Get in 1299/- but not happy with this headphone.",2
I would not recommend this product as iis camera has a error which makes it difficult to use the selfie camera and you will not be able fix at home. Its a defect and on amazon you will not be able to return this product. Only replacement is the option which will lead to you having a new phone with the same defect.,2
Not good sound and bluetooth connectivity i dont like it,2
Is not good,2
"Bought this router after much research and reviews, after using this for over a month, I will say this is not amazingly good, rock solid product as wirecutter reviewed. This can never match the signal strength of my 9 year old linksys, where linksys signal strength in ~90%, tp-link C7 barely manages 40%. A pretty average wireless router with much hype.

Only plus point it has is gigabit ports else I won't recommend this at this price range. Instead put some buks extra and go for nighthawks series or linksys/Cisco.
Avoid this crappy router with filmsy wifi signal even at clear line of site. Someone mentioned they are getting good wifi signal in 3000sqft area, I wonder how? where as in my case it's failing to cover 1800sqft.",2
Not at all comfortable very harsh for ears .....,2
"Bass quality and battery is good
Flaws
Connecting to mobile but unable to continue the conversation,
While on bike no alert of a call",2
"Battery backup is worst. It was clearly mentioned that 20 hours play time, I think company has put 0 in following of 2 by mistake. As it gives only 2 hours play time.
Sound quality is good, but the earbuds doesn't work more than 2hours",2
Bad experience,2
Hearing is good but mic stopped working within 10 days and no one is responding from boat co,2
It's just 3 months I've started using my earphones and I'm shocked that my left ear piece got short-circuit and it became hot and from that time it is not giving proper sound....... and let me tell you my earphones are in warranty right now....... now please tell me how should i replace my earphones...???,2
Good quality.Good quality,2
"Okay, so this was completely not upto my expectations. It showed off waaaay much than portrayed. Seriously way too much. The battery takes up a decade to charge, then don't ask about heating problem. And hangs a lot even though the only thing installed is WhatsApp, Gpay and Truecaller.
.
If you wanna click with simple basic camera and just call or text go for it. And if you pick your phone once or twice in 12 hours then surely it's okay",2
After a month left side speaker is not functioning.,2
"Not so good product . its not getting connected to the app & touch is also not smooth .
the product was not fulfill the acceptations",2
Very poor sound quality ..no bass .it is only use in laptop.it is unuse for TV..you are music lover don't buy it go for another one..some times my TV inbuilt speekers are better than this..,2
Band gets disconnected frequently. Have to reboot the band every time it get connected to mobile.,2
"Always on display is not good... you need to wait for one second and then it recognises and get light...
Not good...other features are good

It is not returnable... please don't buy if not fix in mind....",2
Internet speed is very poor in this device that's why i gave 2 stars only.,2
Better write the try HP laser printer with auto duplex or cannon. I have proof don't neglect this review. It won't print 2000 copies,2
For good hometheater for a cheap price.,2
Good sound and battery life but need to replace left side not working I am changing review as the warranty on the product and Ptron service is very bad they do not support I bought the product so Oct 2019 and one side stopped working send a email and 2 months no response have send them pic and invoice copy so I suggest don't go for it,2
Not so good. Wifi signal is ok. No wifi WDS.,2
"Worst printer...
I don't even use it for 4 days it shows red lights blinking..
If anybody wants to buy then plz check it once..
I hope my review will helpful to you....
One more thing is it's a cartridge printer so it's very expensive tooo... So you can buy ink tank printer even it's price is high....",2
"There is no accuracy in it‚Äôs measurement!! A complete 1 hour workout wasn‚Äôt sufficient for this watch to even show 100 cals!! Apple health showed 93 cals burned whereas this watch was on 40 cals!!
Not upto the mark!!!",2
"not good there is a black strip that is not part of the screen, hate it.",2
This the product review after using for an year. Product is waste . My internet speed is 130 Mbps . 2 ghz gives 20 Mbps and 5 ghz give 60 Mbps. Signal strength is very week . I am so pissed. Worst is all my network devices struggle to connect. Now a days the speed I get is around 20 Mbps on 5 ghz . I would not recommend this product.,2
FM reception absolutely poor. The antennae wire is non functional. Sound quality is pathetic when tuned to FM. Overall sound quality with blue tooth and other devices is average. I would call the product over-rated when I compare the prices.,2
"Bad experience, it has been only 2 months that i have purchased this phone now its wifi module has complaint, it is not working",2
Phone will hang too much... And worst performance,2
Strap need to improve,2
Bad one......,2
Within 20days Router Stopped Working Now I Have To Go To Service Center For Replacement,2
"Sound quality is good, but the Bluetooth range is not good and ears starts hurting after some time only üòî",2
"If you want to use this headphone for shorter duration (3-4 months), then only purchase it. I expected this to last longer but this headphone is not meant to last beyond 3-4 months.",2
performance is no good,2
"Product quality is below average and the mic is not compatible with my mobile.

They don't fit properly.
Overall it's a ok product.
But I will suggest you to add another 400‚Çπ and get a good ear piece.",2
Stopped working after 3 months... Not even powering on now... Still searching for a service center in Chennai city... MI service center is not even answering,2
"Modem stability is good. But there is frequent wifi signal problem and even in next room the signal drops to less than 10% or disconnects. If you're looking for vdsl2 modem, go for huawei",2
"Good looking one as well sufficient features. Even though it's stated that it can support 10 m wireless support but from one room to other room have some disturbance, also it's bit tight to use long time.
Within 6-7 months of use the Aux cable stops to work and Boltt service team denied to rectify the same even though the product within the warranty period. So, I would ask everyone to think twice before have it.",2
WIFI signal strength and range was similar to DLink N150 . Router was getting stuck during installation . Would not recommend this !,2
Its good,2
"Powerful, soft ear pads. Good bass and very good noise cancellation. Felt pretty premium compared to the price paid. --Edited after a month of usage. Rated down from 4-2 stars. After sales service is bad. Doesn't pair well with windows and mic is plain bad. Hinge broke in the second week without even touching it. Will never go for this brand or product again. Still has the awesome noise cancellation and extra bass, but sadly the hinge doesn't help and becomes uncomfortable now. Will save and pay for better brands next time.",2
"Look is not that much attractive as in image. Sensor is not good, it takes time to respond and not much as expected.",2
"Dont buy get something thats worth your money, My left side sounds less where as right side sounds louder compared to other side . After 4 month's Somethimes needs to restart while plaing video bcoz voice breaks so needs restart. Its only good for just 3-4 month's ir 2-3 month's after that its just pure pain.",2
"The watch does not connect or notify whatsapp messages qnd calls also GPS required to be turned on when using noise app. Overall, it just qualifies the designation of a plastic toy to check steps. Mi band is a better cheaper choice.",2
"The router worked great with my laptop and tablets, but strangely the signal would drop off on my wife's laptop and sometimes on my phone as well!

My older Airtel supplied router worked consistently with all our devices, so the issue was definitely with the DLINK DSU 2750U.

Also, was very surprised to see that the firmware doesn't have half the parental control features the older DLINK routers used to have!

Had to return the unit, and am now hunting for a better router.",2
The phone hangs frequently on calling.,2
Battery life not more,2
"I have been using TP-link product for the last 5 years. My previous experience was good but this product is not working as per my expectation. My last product was Portable 3G/4G wireless N router (TL-MR3020). This was broken down after 5 years and it was 2.4 band wireless. Therefore I bought Archer C50 dual band wireless, but its range is the same as the earlier router. Whereas Archer has two dedicated antennae but still its range is not as per expectation. TP-link could have used better Antenna for this product.",2
"I tried the product today as for Covid pandemic, I generally open packet after 72 hrs. Charger is not working. Initially I thought it is issue with the power point. How to replace it?",2

Box's ceel was already open and sticked with cellotape,2
Print quality is below average,2
"The touchscreen and the bluetooth feature does not work properly. There is no gallery in the phone. It ridirects to google photos instead. Camera quality is also not good. I had to arrange a return for this.
Hence Panasonic dropped the ball!!",2
"Overall a good quality watch in every aspect. Still giving 2 star because of alexa support.
Alexa support was promised in upcoming updates, got 2 updates so far in 1 month of time but still no alexa yet.
Alexa is only differentiating factor, apart from that, all other features are available in 5k range smart watches.",2
"The product is really delicate, the wires started to come out loosely from the size adjuster. The aux cable and charge wire are of worst quality.

With Bluetooth: The headphones has an inbuilt microphone but it rarely works and one has to literally shout for the person on other end to be able to hear clearly.

With Aux: Though you will be able to hear but the microphone goes wierd with aux mode. Sometimes microphone works and most of the times it dosen't",2
Wasted,2
"The headphone build quality is ok. Sound to listen is just ok, but the main problem is with mic. When I speak for a call or meeting, the other party just gets humming noise and not my voice ... my voice goes very low to other party ... cleary very poor mic .... not usable.",2

Changing after more than 6 months usage...
Agreed it looked good, but it keeps breaking... i had to use fevi-quick to stick the body of earpiece. I ordered the 242 bassheads. I will write a review after sturdy usage.",2
The sound quality should be better.,2
"Poor signal strength... Not recommended
After 3 months of use,.. don't buy this.. it frequently loses WiFi connection and resets password on is own (in new firmware for it fixed). Overall very poor performance.",2
"Some problem in the mobile, automatically closing if anything opened",2

"Inaccurate in step counting.
Display good
Cannot answer call from it.
Not recommended",2
About to know about warranty,2
Design although copied from apple but very uncomfortable,2
The worst product ever. Dont go for it. It has the worst voice.,2
"A useful product indeed for typical Indian power supply situation with frequent outages. However I'm editing my review to note that this is a use and throw product with no serviceability or battery replacement options by the seller.

One year update: the battery inside has 'died;. The unit is no longer proving even a minute of backup.
My version stopped providing backup after 8-9 months of use.

Update 2: Contacted Resonate support and was informed that product warranty is only 6 months. It cannot be repaired by Resonate support and the only option they offered me was a discount code to purchase a new unit.

Disappointed. In hind sight, I should've just ordered the cheaper chinese alternatives. I'm down revising my original rating to 2 stars (for quick shipping and good packaging).",2
Quality is too bad only look is good,2
No bad,2
"Audio quality is inferior, even after using earphone",2
"Was working perfectly for the first six months & has good range. However, hardware is not of good quality & started giving issues (frequent rebooting, low speed, frequent disconnects, etc) thereafter. D-link provided door step replacement with a refurbrished product but not satisfied with the quality & performance of this replacement product. There are better options in this price range.",2

"I am writing this after 10 months of using this product- routerUPS.
It worked well first few months, giving the power backup as specified- i would have rated 5/5 had it continued to work. Last few weeks , the power storage capcity seemed to have reduced, sometimes working only for few minutes after main power failed. Last week it stopped working completely. Contacted Resonate Care, they asked me to send an email with issue details and invoice. After two days they asked me to send the product picture along with the Router. done. After two more days they send me a RMA # and ask me to ship the product to them at my expense. Sent. waiting for my luck to get a replacement now.
My rating is based on the painful experience of warranty claim.",2

"During online meeting through laptop, lot of times speakers disconnected automatically & my voice is not very clear at other end when using this headset. Only good for listening",2
As expected sound is not good and durability is also not like expected. Better to buy another model. Wire quality is not that much more good.,2
Though the smart watch seems value for money but it has pathetic user application and warranty registration process.,2
I like step monitoring and cycle feature,2
Very average product..with respect to the name of the brand JBL,2
"Very very bad camera quality
Otherwise ok",2
"Signal strength is worst. I don't get signal in my kitchen which has only one wall between hall and kitchen. My wifi placed in hall. In bed behind wall of wifi router is only 2 lines visible. In hall, it works like charm. When 2 antennas were there they worked good on those days, now 5 or 6 antennas with China make give nothing useful just a look.",2
Sound quality is pathetic but if you know how to use the equaliser only then go for it but you will get hundreds of options in same price range. Don't go fot these just go for some other like boat bassheads 152,2
"The reason am giving this 2 stars is because the headphones are great to listen to music but HORRIBLE for taking calls.

I bought these thinking i could dual purpose it for my office Teams calls and swap it over for my entertainment too. But, there is so much distortion and lack of clarity and the mic makes it sound like I am stuck in a cave.

Don‚Äôt buy it if you want to use it for work.

On the entertainment side, heavy on the bass and above average mid levels.

Active noise cancelling is a gimmick. Just move to a quiet place and use regular headphones.",2
I got this watch but however returned it in next 2 days. The back of the watch was seperated from the watch and was looking ugly. Very bad with battery life n also with the connectivity. The back of the watch is horrible I would advice the company if this is a common issue please fix it as it is hampering the status n image of the brand,2

first thing it the image depicted is not correct.! the leds on the panel are misleading.. there are only 3 leds not as many shown. on the rear side the ports (lan) are not colour coded. the power cable provided is too short..,2
In one year it started to create problem. Bad buy,2
Headset quality is good but sound latency is bigger and audio quality is medium must buy ptron tangent not lite..if you are a music lover,2
Ink problems üòî,2

Only buy for 5G other than not very much impressive.. it cost should bhi only 15k then justified.",2
"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and found this to be very heavy in terms of its weight.
Additionally, the camera quality is not so good. The battery also lasts for a day with almost 1 hour of talk time.

I was expecting a better camera quality and battery backup.",2
Not great. Very poor signal even at 3m distance. 5g signal not working.,2

"I bought this because I had great Philips speakers in the past. However I am really disappointed by the sound qualityof this one.

Specifically with Bluetooth it sounds no better than cheap chineese speakers.",2
"~ If you are a clear sounds' person, this is one of the best in this price range (got it for INR 499).
~ Overall sound quality is good.
~ Kind of clear sounding with feeble mids and bass. (not ""Hi-Fi"" as advertised!)
~ At times the volume turms low and then comes back to normal somehow (I really didn't get the reason for that).
~ Easy to use for normal, day to day purposes only (not suitable for gym or other vigorous exercises: the buds are a bit slippery - i even tried changing them with the other supplied ones).
~ Bass quality gets only a 5/10 points.
~ Not good for calls. Mic sounds very much muffled.
~ Build quality gets a 9/10 points. The wires, the neckband and the earphones itself feels quite well built and durable.

Overall nice product - if you are on a budget of under 500, go for it.",2
Qulality as per the price is not good enough,2

Main problem Bad range ....better buy other model,2
"Pros-
Cheap headphone with good audio quality under this price rangeü§ó

Cons-
1.Bass is not that deep.üòë
2.This is a weird one- Due to very slight movement sometimes the headphone jack gets disturbed and suddenly Google home pops up out of nowhere when using it on mobile.

I was using this for a year and after that there was a power cut and when I started it again it was not working I have also reached to customer care which was a skype and I got the center address as well but there was no service center there was a locked home and no one was there. So if you are thinking that you will get support forget it.,2
No doubt the sound quality was good. However not durable doesn't last more than 5 months. Tried checking for replacement but it was denied stating out of warranty but the product comes with one year warranty. Don't buy if you are looking for product that will last long.,2

This router is a big fail to my upgrading plans. My wifi use to be much smoother and consistent over my previous roter of tp link with half the price.

I tried replacing it with another piece but the result is the same.",2
"From a brand like JBL, this earphone does not fit the bill.

I have used other JBL earphones before and would vouch for them but this one is so below expectations. Currently I'm in need of one hence I won't be returning it but this surely won't get my good review. Either I got a fake or this model is not worth purchasing.,2
"I am writing this review after using 1 year

The print quality is good
Scanning quality is very poor
But the print speed is very low
If you don't use your printer for a while the print head will be clogged

The main problem is that you won't get genuine ink from market( in my area)
The bottle looks same
You have to check it , there is no supply of ink by the manufacturer through online

I am dis satisfied with this product

I am using various types of printers for last 8 years

If you need a printer
Go for Epson or BROTHER
HP IS ASO GOOD",2

Again the locking system of display unit to charging unit is very loose and I have to use a rubber band to fix it properly for charging. This a pathetic aspect of designing.

Updated after use- really wonderful performance and worth the money you spend. Still the design of charging unit lock is very bad, this smart band is the best in market",2

The product is very stable, easy configuration and other features like parental control. However, 100 mbps is not good enough for many of us considering high speed internet is available, better go for a true Gigabit (10/100/1000) WAN port router.",2

"Flimsy plastic body, very uncomfortable if used for more than an hour, and noise cancelling is a joke! Let me tell you the product can be made for one quarter of its selling price, the recipe is very simply put together a weak plastic body with some cheap and basic headphone amenities, add some flashy lights and market it as something that is above and beyond the world at its price range. False advertising at is finest! You may think it maybe is my fault for expecting too much, but the problem is I never had any great expectations, I wanted a simple headphone which would do its basic functions but man this product has managed to take my expectations which were on the ground to the basement! What happened to all those affordable nice headphones from the early 2000's, technology has seen a great revolution but quality have only become less durablre and unaffordable!",2

"Very slow operation , camara is totally wast it's good quality go for mi 9 Note Pro or Max , Not why this Mobil is slow due to mediatek processer I guess",2
"Chinese fake sony headphones at this cheap rate..
I have boat and jbl headphones and got this headphones.
Bass quality supur low.
Surrounding effect is so so...
Build up quality is poor.
Spounch of the headphones is too poor quality.
I purchased this headphones just because of brand name and peoples review but its not worth..",2
I have purchased this Band on 6th December 2019 but battery are discharge within 6 hours after 100% charge. Please suggest how we replace this battery.,2
First time I am disappointed with Ptron Product. Sound quality as well as Mic quality is poor. There are better options available in the same price range.,2
The thermometer feature is completely waste as it shows inaccurate reading. Inaccurate temperature readings,2
Have been using these headphones daily for almost a month and the quality is poor. The volume in the right earpiece has already been defected and you can hardly hear anything that too in less that a months usage. The wires get tangled all the time and not of good quality. I am really disappointed with the quality of earphones from JBL.,2
"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited
2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP
3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .
No handsfree in the box",2
Not even a year and green vertical lines have started to appear on screen it could not have been due to power fluctuation since i used ups and have always switch off the monitor using power button before turning off ups...expected more from a reputed brand like LG.,2
"If cover is with phone it will be good ,& earphone",2
Processor is slow,2
"It's been an year my experience was good but the strap had been broken with normal use , suitable for 6 months use only",2
Very bad prodect no warranty cover only fake,2

good.",2
Singal problem so i retun it,2
Microphone stopped working after one month for some strange reason.,2
"This product have most simply (4) options no worth for this price, notification and call notification are very slow some times not working,, I try to return and refund but it's show there are no option only replacement,,
Disappointed...",2
"Such a big brand name can deliver this kind of poor quality earphones. Unexpected. I was looking for an earphone for under 500 and so brand was not a concern for me. So I thought boat is definitely a great choice. But suddenly I found JBL earphones at such a special price of 449. I went through the specs and they said great bass and great noise cancellation and sound quality. But it is a complete wastage. I felt cheated.
So please do not buy this product. It is waste of money. You can get good quality sound in other brands. I can't believe JBL is doing such fake advertisements.
Go for other options. Don't waste your money on it.",2
"Camera quality not good on night mod, And charger USB cable was very bad quality.",2
Sound quality is really poor. My older Envent Beatz earphones are much better than this one. Not expected this quality from Boat. Poor Bass also.,2
Not upto mark,2
So bad,2
"watch function doesn't work property, sleep tracking-0 no. notifications-1 no.
other feature-3. not satisfied with the product at all k",2
My device getting off many times in a day. This is ridiculous and annoying.,2
"When u don't do any kind of work or while traveling in bus , this counts the steps...I don't know whether it's a bug ... sleep tracking is also not up to the mark...",2
"Mi band is very good.
Belt quality is not good.
Belt is broken after 8 month of use
Improve belt quality.
Watch is good.
As per the price belt quality is very very poor.",2
Not the best but good enough but not that good stiLL fine not cost effective but wort lh buying....RIP,2
"Ok the DSLR Giant Canon have launched 1 more entry level DSLR. Actually i bought this camera for my friend. Does this camera worth 31K. Lets see

PROS
1. Its easy to use
2. Decent battery backup
3. Live mode operation is not lagging.

CONS
1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.
2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.
3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.
4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.
5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk
6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject
7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.
I am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.
In one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.

I am not biased towards Nikon, i wrote wat i felt.
Its not worth for money",2
printing from windows 10 via wifi connection is not possible. connect with wifi but not printing,2
Bought it after reading reviews here.sound is crystal clear with very poor bass.really disappointed,2
Uses more cartridge n price is too high,2
"This product is good but it would have been great product if it was not having the following flaws,
1.Fitting Issues (can easily fall off the ear)
2.Bass (not so great)
These are the issues with this product...If it is rectified then it will a great product as well as a better competitor for Apple Air pods. The major issue is about the fitting in the ear.",2
"A pathetic product from a pathetic company with no commitment towards Good service.
Customer service team is truly pathetic 3 months and the replacement of the item is yet not happened.
Please don't buy Ptron products at all...
Go for Boult Which has better service",2
"I give a 2 star because
In staring he's perfectly work
But after 1 year 1 right Speck is not working",2
"My 2 BHK flat is not covering the network it is very bad and like rejected materials,

not satisfied for the product.",2
LACK OF DISPLAY FOR SETTING IS A HANDICAP AND PRINTER JAMS ALOT.,2
"heating issue,",2
"The camera quality is really very pathetic...
Just disgusting..",2
The connection drops quite regularly in the middle of the call as well. Mine stopped working within 8 months of purchase. Now it works only in one ear. My usage was not rough but regular usage for calls. Now buying a new one but not of this brand.,2
Too small screen . Touch sensation is rough as well as not good as i expected,2
The sound of the speaker is very less. Buffer is also very bad quality.,2
"Bass Quality Very Low , Means Silent Song Feel Very Very Soft Bass & Any DJ Or Remix Songs Baas Quality Also Feel Normal Sound Baas :

Tip - Suggested This Only Silent Song Lover People Can Enjoy Only Silent Song As Per Yourself",2
Less print quantity as compare to l360 printer,2
"Mobile 48mp camera is like a 4mp , very poor quality lance's are mounted on it. I personally recommend don't buy this mobile, choose another brand or model.thank you",2
On the CD written 2130 but on printer is 2131 and on you app also 2131 . what is this your product is worst,2
Within 3 months of use the headphone part has been damaged  -9769129642,2
Device is automatically disconnected with app so this problem is frustrated every time so the best is return or don't buy,2
Very poor sound.,2
"I would like a better wifi router, which has dual band frequency i.e. 2.4 GHz as well as 5 GHz.
I want to exchange the item I bought 10 days back with one of the following router

1. Link AC750 Dual Band (3 antennas)
OR
2. TP Link Archer C6 Gigabit Dual Band (4 antennas)",2
It doesn't give correct reading of heart beat. The reading is very low and doesn't match with reading with other instruments.,2
Worked well for few days and then the right ear volume went low...,2
Material is good. But sound clarity is not up to expectation. Only brand is SONY but it is anyway made in china. So can't expect much.,2
Waste of its kind,2
Camera is worst n processor not good.but battery backup is superbbb,2
Slow printer. Takes lot of time to initiate printing compared to other brand printers of comparable price.,2
"Bakwas phone
Bahut hang marta hai",2
"it is good for the first few days, but after 1 week. colors being shaded. Item is delivered only 2 weeks back and i don't see return option.",2
The watch stopped working after 8 hours of use. Nothing is visible on the display. It is not showing any indication whether its charging or not.,2
Router speed does not go beyond 100 mbps even though the literature claims it does so. Signal was fairly stable. I returned the router as it did not fulfill its claim oh delivering higher speed.,2
The print image is very dull. It appears that either old & dry ink cartridges have been sent with the printer or these ink cartridges are filled with duplicate ink and not the original one.,2
"I unit cable charging and I unit 1 fitness..

Accessories is not provide.

Missing part accesorios. I want to get video with inital packing and..I want to refund my product.....It is decive and cheating of customer ..",2
"It not worth for the money.
Sound quality is not good.
I think it will be delivered best sound quality but its like cheap headphones sound quality, really I am not happy by buying this product.
Even my old headphone give me much better sound quality than this and it's just of 3k price.
I get very disappointed.",2
I suggest you people please don't buy this kind of products not even value for 500,2
I am.changing my review as it stopped working after months. One side is of speaker is not working.,2
"Build quality is average. This is my 5th earphone of same product, and always they got defected from wire joint near audio jack.",2
Don't like but do you all note 9 pro have to all buy the mobile is a best,2
"5 months usage update - microphone stopped working and with the ultimate careful usage the speaker seems to be shaken.. product is good but the quality and reliability is not so good for the money .. I could have gone for a skull candy which was reliable for more than 2 years ..

after these many months usage even the battery seems to drain faster than the initial time period ..

Awesome quality product.. using it for straight 9hrs of my working hours and I charge it three days once .. mainly using to connect with my mi4k audio while connecting to Bluetooth audio video lags on 4K and by aux audio is extremely low .. not sure if it‚Äôs Bluetooth issue or the mi4k tv issue.. hope I figure that out sooner ..",2
Phone security is best but camera aand battery quality is poor,2
"So I ordered two of these, one in white and another one in red. The sound is not that loud as with full volume I was able to hear people talking beside me (my way of testing how loud the headphones can get :P)
Strangely the white ones sound better than the red one on same phone on same audio.
The white ones have more bass compared to the red ones but don‚Äôt know why such thing should happen. The JBL ones are much better which I have been using and cost ‚Çπ200 more from this.",2
Looks poor quality. Very thin wires. Sound quality not that great. Looks like any other street product and not a jbl headphone. Highly dissapointed. Made in China. So you get the picture,2
With 3 antenas it still works like a regular router on a 100mbps line.,2
"Box delivered in open condition, battery backup ver low, Connectivity is very very poor",2
The ear phones have already stopped working and I need a new pair. Did not expect such a short life span from a JBL ear phone.,2
Good mobile at this cost but slow,2
Not as good as expected,2
"Uncomfortable to wear it in ear. Sound qaulity is good. After leastening song for few minutes, starts pain in ear, also while mic is far, so every time during calls We have to keep close to mouth, so always one hand to hold mic near to mouth, there for we couldn't say it's as handsfree. So I am considering cost is high with these draw back.",2
"I didn't like this printer. Only you can print of color 15-20 and then is empty.you can't scan in this. Printing permomce is very bad. 1 page print in minimum 1 minute color or black.
You can't use without smartphone.",2
"Product is fine,but the prices dropped the very next day i received tge package!",2
"It is not that good product, Boat has reputation of being quality product but my headphones started malfunctioning within 3 months of purchase.",2
"Hi Team,

Product: Am facing heating compliant and performance and camera quality is very bad.

Reg Amazon : I tried to return the product but they were not ready to take the product back even it's not working
and amazon customer care disabled the return and call option without completion of the return date mentioned before ordered the product...

i suggest everyone before ordering any product please check with customer care about the return policy and keep the evidence with you, because amazon people not maintaining company standards to return the product",2
Green tint at low light on grey backgrounds.,2
"Photo printing is an issue as I select printing photo on glossy photo paper it says select different configuration. Else it's good but I bought it for photo printing and that's not working so I'm disappointed. Ink consumption is too high and you can not refill cartridge as printer driver director sets no print if refill is empty it consider ink cartridges empty, thus no more printing. Sad.",2
Stopped working 6-7 months after purchase. Invest in better product or buy cheaper of the road for 100-200 bucks,2
"Not the best watch , but has some great features ..",3
It is very easy to install it just by following any YouTube video. Very less Wifi range. Other than this it's Good.,3
"Sound quality is not good like other sony headphones have and i understand that ""itne pese me itna he milega"" q",3
"The product quality was good. However, Exchange not applicable, disappointed",3
"The overall watch is very good . But their is an problem to connect to your phone .....
The watch is disconnected easily and disconnected many times....",3
its good,3
Everything is ok but camera quality is so bad,3
Please go for JBL & not this one from Sony. It fits loosely & half the sound goes outside!,3
"Pros:
1. Speakers (Hardly any others have)
2. HDMI ports 2 (No other in this price segment)
3. A good screen and sturdy stand
4. Auto brightness adjustment sensor

Cons:
1. Useless VGA cable (after 2019 which laptop comes with VGA port??) HDMI cable is must.
I tried using type-c to VGA adaptor, monitor works but speakers do not work.
2. Not so great speakers (don't think of using it as TV)
3. Backlight bleed all over (typical IPS)
4. HDMI ports are very near, cannot put a cable and fireStick together (2 cables will work easily)

It could have been really handy if it had USB ports, but no !

I bought this on sale, costed me Rs. 6750, worth the money, I am going to keep this despite of cons but due to the pros. I would recommend buying if you are ok with these cons.",3
"After using it for a month, I thinks this kind of equipment is essential, but I also thinks it‚Äôs highly overpriced, since you would use this for interim power supply, mine is connected to inverter so I have it only to avoid switching, however I purposefully tested its power backup on my airtel Wi-Fi router, it lasted for only 2 hours, there are other alternatives available for less than Rs. 1000, would recommend those instead.",3
"Just a couple of days latter, the phone started behaving abnormally. Application would open on their own randomly. Seemed liked some spot on the touch screen remain pressed and it kept opening up apps. Had to reboot it everytime to sort this out.

The phone otherwise works smooth. But this above problem has occurred a multiple of time which has soured my experience.",3
"Product is ok. You can't change bass and treble from main deck. And also there is no equalizer settings for aux. Equalizer will work only in USB and MMC. Sound output is above average. Good product quality. Dancing LED on main deck is attractive.
Delivery from Amazon is worst. Took another 2 days for delivery after they promised.",3
Description is not matching with actual product. Description mentioned as IPS. Couldn't find any where mentioned as IPS in manual or product. I found as LCD monitor.,3
It's not working in noise fit app,3
Not a good product,3
One speaker not working time best,3
Overall performance is good but the only problem i am facing is the battery draining even though i don't connect the bluetooth it is getting drained in 3 to 4 days,3
"That's a very nice product but here we can't receive the calls, only we can disconnect. First time it's very difficult to set up the settings I'm not so much satisfied with this features but product is working tq... Amazon",3
Nothing good Artis E400 best and better than JBL this headphone I'm not happy with this,3
"I would have given 5 rating if wire quality would have provided in non tangible.
Because in this price this headset is worthable but it is disappointing for wire quality.",3
By looks it is really good. But not accurate at all.,3
"App is very poor when you receive a call on display it seen new call no, number or name display",3
Fingerprint reader quit good battery life is also good but camera quality very poor.,3
Bhai camara quality bhut khrab hai is mobile ki jyada khraab h,3
"All the functions are a little iffy when we synching the data on the app. The sleep tracking, SpO2, Heart Rate, Temperature, all of them show gaps. Of these SpO2 is the worst, even though, I have kept, temperature and SpO2 continuous tracking. BP is alright, as it only measures, when I want it to. The watch itself seems to work fine. It is the syncing that seems to be issue. The app may need a robust update",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I ordered this product. And i got it in time. I used it for a day and realised thta whenever i try to adjust the headphones the volume on either side of headphone will discreas and gets distorted. I applied for a replacement. I got my replacement in time. And same issue occured again and the side cushion was not stiched well and was damaged.I think the volume decrease problem is in evey product.Now this time i have applied for a refund. Not worth it. The previous version of boat rockerz were far better than this version.
Thinking of buying sony or maybe JBL headphones.",3
"The 803Bk Cartridge prints over just 100 Pages , Hence buying a cartridge for approximately Rs. 800 and and printing just 100 word document pages , surely tell you high your printing cost goes up. So if they suggest you should use this printer only if your printing is approximately 250-400 pages per month i would again say no as , would suggest this printer only if you have 100 pages per month.",3
"Steps: not accurate.
Sleeps tracking: 80% correct.
Now I am using this tracker for Alarm only.",3
Okay not that much satisfied,3
Camera quality is not upto the mark .. very bad as per mentions 48MP,3
"It is an average product. The call receving/rejection button is not there, nor it is convenient to adjust volume level.",3
Basic feature is the step count which is not accurate i wonder from where and how the step count goes up. Not sure if other feature is working accurately.,3
I wanted to increase view time of watch but there is no option. There should be more options in settings of mobile app D-fit.,3
"Product is good in every aspect .
Noise cancellation is so so.
Durability of product is worse ,one seide of wire doesn't work after 3 months .",3
Does this laptop comes with free MS office...I am having trouble using office related stuff,3
"Pros:
Light weight
adequate screen brightness
call and notification alerts works flawlessly

cons:
Error in stress and other measurements most of the time
Watch face options are limited
Build quality could have been better
not meeting the value of the money paid",3
"Have been using it for a 10 days now , the Canon Support Team was quick to come and set it up in 3 days after booking the slot. Overall product looks fine and it is not fast as the new line of printers. Scanning a simple text document takes upto 30 sec. Printing B/W doc takes upto 15-20 secs. But the pain is in the color printing , it took almost a minute and half to print my son's birth certificate.

Hope this issue gets resolved in advanced versions of this model.",3
"The earphones which I received were not new, i.e., already used. Sound clarity is good upto some level but at very high sound it is not that much clear. Wires are too delicate. Microphone and in-line button are working undoubtedly well.",3
"You will need to restart the model every day for it to give full speed.
Has bandwidth control",3
"The sound Not fulfilled upto the expectations. Anyway the built quality of the product is good enough.
Thus can be a budget headphone",3
"Received with DARK Blue color.
Made in china.",3
"Really disappointing... Heart rate monitoring is not working, very poor performance...",3
It is a nice product in such a range. But if you want a faster phone rhen please don't buy this. It's reaponse is not quick.,3
Just received the router. The services of amazon is five star. The router was installed on the very first day of receipt and i am using it for the past three days. It seems the range of the router is less and is not showing signals as expected. This has been installed in a room but outside the room the signal strength reduces to half. So in case you are looking for a better signal reqt pls do research before selecting this product. Since i has bought this now i have to live with it..Only a ok product,3
"Not comfortable for long use, but complete value for money",3
"in this price sound quality is good, all speakers work.",3
Very average soun quality. One of the side is not working already.,3
Okay. Used for one year. Now using jio fi router,3
I was using a friends MI router and was looking at replacing it with my own. But though its costlier the range is lesser than a MI router.,3
"Fingerprint OK
Battery life no good
Camera quality is good",3
"Bass Is Not That Great But It's Ok ..
All Over Nice Product..",3
"Good battery , very slow charging, very heavy to hand",3
"Temperature, Heart rate, displayed are not accurate. While travelling by car without ac it showed 104.5 F and when I put on the ac temperature showed 97.1F. The Heart rate shown is also high. I croosed checked the reading with a BP monitor, the watch showed 118 and the BP monitor showed 95.",3
Not really worthy at 600 INR. received a damaged piece.one side of this headphone giving larger sound output then the other one which starts creating an headache just after some minutes of using this. can't return this as i don't have enough time to waste so using as it is .worst experience with JBL .,3
"Purchased in August, Left Speaker stopped working in Jan ( 5 months old exactly ). The Product says there is 1 year warranty but when I Went to Sony Service Center, they said they don't repair/exchange Sony products bought from amazon. I had bought JBL TS250SI for 1000 bucks a couple of years back, it worked really well for about 15 months! I Really doubt the genuineness of this Sony Product.",3
Sound quality is not as per brand expectation,3
It‚Äôs not compatible with MacBook Air 13 (2015),3
"Absolutely nothing wrong with the aound, but it stopped working after two months and after that I didn't get time to avail the warranty so...",3
"HDMI cable not provided.
Power supply cable not given with the product",3
It's overall a satisfying product. If u wants to get clear sound then it's best but if u get louder sound then it's not to a suitable product..,3
Audio is not balanced. Right side speaker slightly more sound than left speaker. But just it's very slight difference that's why not replacing. Overall the product is good.,3
"Music is not clear, Good bass",3
Phone camera is not worth the quality mentioned and the device is also having more weight... Rethink if you want to buy this... Not sure why amazon removed return policy it's better to check phone locally in shop and buy,3
"New phone is also getting hang
Ram management is not soo good",3
Sounds good,3
"Pros:
1. Lookwise is a spider and seems to be pro in market
2. User interface is smooth and of new generation unlike Tplink, tenda, netgear
3. Dual band enabled and gigabit port available

Cons:
1. Biggest con is range is not at all upto the mark. Tp link router with no antenna provides wider range.

This is the reason it has 3 stars from my end.",3
good product,3
Overall product is good. Sound quality is great. But microfone is not up to the mark. Sometimes my voice are not audible to the person who is on the other side if the call,3
Better quality,3
i like the product very much what was bit disappointed the way specifications were mentioned please clear the point of connectivity of dsl port to avoid inconvenience,3
Sound quality is good but the wire quality is very low,3
"Good but , too much treble sound. Not not satisfied. Bad to hear. Otherwise all are ok. It will be an better product if treble is reduced.",3
Its good but cannot wear for a long time,3
"Sound and built quality is nice also durable..
But i was ordered a JBL headset with it at the same day , i found the jbl is better in bass and sound quality than Sony",3
"It was working good but stopped working within a month, dead now total waste. Quality need to improve....",3
Printing is good but use too much ink,3
Functional,3
Speakers plastic are very Ruff,3
"Packaging in which i recived was not at all good. Overall product is decent good according to price but if you are looking for bass oriented headphones, it's not good but if you are looking for music clarity, it's best.",3
"For somewhat the product is Ok .
Camera Quality is osm.
Battery life is also very good.
I think in 12000 u got
Redmi

48 mp quard camera
It is amazing
Should buy",3
Good range....but data transfer rate low...,3
"Lagging while connecting, long Lasting battery life",3
I bought this for my grandparents. According to its price this phone is a good choice but then it can't be used for a longer period of time as it gets heated up within a few time of usage. The camera quality is satisfactory. This phone is not for gaming brats as it gets heated up way sooner.,3
Good but not perfect don't take,3
Packing was not good.less then one,3
Average Mobile,3
step count is not accurate.,3
"At this price it‚Äôs a good buy
But why buy a product which inaccurately detects bpm and steps are counted even when travelling by bus.
Buy analog instead or if you want to collect data about your body buy Apple Watch or Fitbit",3
"Pros-
1. Feature loaded
2. Enriched app experience
3. AMOLED Display

Cons-
1. Average battery life
2. Activity tracking below par ( incorrect reading 7/10 times)",3

"Looking beautifulüíñ
Battery is so good
And camera quality is not good
Comfort in hand",3
"Base is overrated and average sound quality.

Base is not that much great we can get the same in any headphones. Prefer other in-ear headphones if you want base clear sound. Not comfy",3
"Not worth it
Money not well spent",3
"I am giving it a 3 star because the build is soo bad my headphone got broken after 1 year approx
And sound quality is best in the segment. Bass is perfect and instrumental differentiation is amazing.
And comfort of this headphone is also amazing at this price
The only problem is build. So keep in mind that. Importantly the wire inside was not broken the frame was broken.",3
Notifications are not working / pop ups. Sometimes I get them in Chinese languages & email notifications are not available,3
Not so happy with Audio out quality,3
"Sleep tracking is functional. Sleep data in the noise App should give explicit details of time between sleep and wake up.
Stress monitor is also functional.
Other functions like e- mails, call notifications are good.
Strap Material can be improved as continuous wearing can put rashes on your wrist.
Touch screen and look is good.",3
Gud,3
It's okie router but many times I see signal problem even though Internet is working but still it's a pretty good but in Terms on range..,3
"this product was nice but not best
If u want it for bass only then u must go for it
but if u want it for studio work like me.....

Bluetooth connectivity is very bad if u put phone in pocket it the song does not play clearly (audio lag)
comfort of headphones is just amazing.......",3
"Product is hyped. Bass performance is bad and plastic quality is bad too.. looks like a toy.

Spend a bit extra.. Go for better products.",3
"I connected it to my android phone via Bluetooth to listen the songs. But when I turn on the mobile's HotSpot to connect my laptop WiFi, sound started to break. If I turn off the Hotspot, sound is ok and as soon as I turn on the HotSpot again sound starting to break.
Not sure if it's manufacuting defect in all products or I just received a faulty piece.",3
Phone looks good but it is too heavy and lagging a lot while switch between apps.. Charging capacity is too good..,3
"Finger print sensor is good.
Battery life is just satisfactory.
The worst part is the front camera as well as the rear camera. Very dull photos.",3
"Camera disappointed, c type is missing,",3
"Updated after using 3 months:
Firs review was 1/5: Battery is super bad, it is just exhausting in 9 hours.
Nothing to write in detail, when it comes to battery life.. which is way too short comparatively.
Update : Support team called me after I have reviewed here, they first tried to troubleshoot on call support after few attempt they picked the item from my home and changed/replaced the dial and returned me after 10-15 days, since then watch battery is nice asit goes approx 20-25 days without reguar connection to phone.
Dial is small compare to screen ratio watch faces are very less, customization also have very less scope.",3
Everything is fine except Battery life. Not so great will run only for a day. You have to charge it daily.,3
Not original jbl,3
"Worked well for 8 months then it failed. So Rs 2500/ for 8 months. Well, it works fine, but not durable.",3
"Donot buy if you wish to play games and watch movies with inbuilt speakers and display has a huge backlight bleeding issues at the most.
All the above looks correct once you have it for yourself.",3
You buy it without spending too much so don't mind it all. Counterparts cost much more,3
"Prints and photo copies are very different from original. The Blue colour in original is printed as light black.
The ink also spreads often.",3
"Decent printer for occasional use. Its a bit noisy at every first use. Printer cartridge is a pain!! Black cartridge is around Rs.900 and Coloured one is also Rs.900 or so. If you calculate it will around Rs.1800/- which is pretty much near the pronter cost. I bought this printer few months ago for Rs.2600/-
So think twice before buying because the printer price is low but cartridges are very EXPENSIVE!
Overall the print experience is good in this price but if you are price sensitive post purchase on per page print then this is not for you! Cost per print would be around Rs.4-5 per page for black one.
Use it only in EMERGENCY!",3
"Liked the build quality.But sound is a bit low.Bass quality is good enough to persist for long.
Felt a little discomfort when kept on for long time,ear cuffs cusioning can be made better.
Over all a good product.",3
"1. First time registered in the app.After I bought a new phone when I try to sync it says you are not registered and again when you register it will ask do you have a mi account. I am still logging first with my email id then with the mobile # and Password. Still didn't get the logic behind this
2.Night before you go to bed the Watch will show you will have 8000+ steps on morning when you sync it will miss few steps and it will be below.
3.Sleep Tracking is worst of all. Always says my deep sleep is less, Even after I woke up fresh after 10 hours sleep. One day I didn't wear the watch till 12 o clock and it started calculating the time from 9 to 12 as deep sleep.",3
"Overall it is ok, but not satisfied about camera quality, and screen quality it is maybe more improved by Samsung, I am really disappointed about camera and screen quality and also processor.",3
Cycle tracking is really bad....app updation is same as older bands...the only improvement I could see is with the oled screen....I drove 25 KMS while enabling mi watch with attached gps(no purpose served) and it showed only 1.5 KMS as it loses gps signal frequently. Wasted money...go for bigger leaders if u are serious about tracking or else it is utter waste of money.,3
It is worth its price but nowhere near mi earbuds. If you have money go for mi.,3
"Wifi configuration is very difficult, please go with the printer which has display",3
"This phone, it has only one different quality that it comes with 4+64 ram and storage, nothing extra quality earlier i was using redmi y2 i believe it was better than this redmi 9 i want to give only 3.5 rating according to quality mark",3
"Good looking, light weight, easy to carry, good mic, sorry to say but not much good sound quality, rather boat 400 has better base and sound quality. Aux and charging cable are ok-ok!! Not much, easy to break.
Packing was really worse!! If want good sound, then boat 400; if want good outer look, then boat 450.",3
"I recommend this to noisy bass lovers but not for the true sound lover.
If u prefer ultra-clear and some quality stuff, well u won't get into this price range. But the company did well in the budget and the facilities are impressive.
Build quality is very casual(average), it's Bluetooth and aux connectivity are great.",3
"USB is not working and need to check SD/MMC card, other things are ok",3
"I have ordered these twice. although they are good in sound and quality.
But they don't last longer. Eventually one side will stop working.
and it will get broken with regular use.",3
Like very much this product,3
Print quality not good on normal 80gsm,3
The adapter you provided along with the router didn't work at all,3
A digital watch with accurate sleep and workout tracking but poor step tracking. Also the mifit app has to be synced several times continuously to sync workouts properly. Step tracking is very poor. Daily it adds nearly 6000 steps for my 2h bus travel. But at 2299/- it's okay. Battery is good too. Works 15-20 days on full charge and charge also doesnt take very long. This review is for 2 month usage.,3
"I was returned,due to uncomfortable in wearing the band,for long time usage ,it is bad,only for workout",3
"Just OK product for daily basic functions like browsing, Spread sheet and Word editing.

Comes with a Windows 10.
Doesn't include MS office.
Good resolution.
Battery backup for 4 hr max (if you are playing music and videos)",3

Inck catrage,3
Not worth Price,3
If you are a music lover then dont buy it guys. Bass is low .If you need budget home theatre in 3000Rs then go for it .best thing is all speakers are by wood .,3
Sounds are audible to outside up to 5m distance also.. So disturbing to others.. Wire is damaged in 4months and cant understand where is the problem. But quality is good,3
It's not the one for gaming Unless you are having a massive upgrade. It's a bit too faded for antiglare and colour calibration is your headache now. It's ergo is nice and in all its a sleek monitor with its looks. I got it in quarantine and it's been nice till now.,3
"The video quality is very good. The design of the product is also good with thin borders. However, the audio quality of inbuilt speakers is extremely poor. I have an earlier model of the same product GW2270. That GW2270 has superior audio quality compared to this later model.

Another small issue is that no HDMI cable is provided (mentioned in the desc). However, the VGA cable that is provided is too small, barely 1m long.",3
But for this watch is working. But I cannot change my phone because of the watch. That is why I gave it three stars. Other feature are working and might be useful. I had to use my discarded phone to make it work. So Iphone user beware,3

Overall good gor mobile phone s.",3
Ok jet satisfaction,3
Correct product received with good condition. The power adaptor 19V supplied with this is not working properly. Screen gone off often. Now screen is getting off after 10 to 15 minutes after getting on. Checked by the electrician and conformed to change the adaptor. No problem in the monitor. Replacement is required for adaptor.,3
Range not as expected,3
"I got slow speed isue, then I tried to costomer care very difficult to get costomer care because no direct option to call costomer care only after selecting nombers after call , After many failour last got costomer care after that they will become very helpful to solve the problem , by phone by their dirrection solved the slow speed problem .The reason for problem is black ink is finished so printer worked very slowly solution for this problem is 1. Only use any one cartridge which have ink, 2nd solution is if we use both ink cartridge then make shour both cartridge have ink.
After that they say they approve ink cartridge only not approve ink refill or not guarante will not get.
Product name : DeskJet 1112 , prise :2000 rupees
Ink prise from shop 803 code black :750 and color have more then 1000 rupees",3
Average  product.Bought it recently and working good,3
Ordered rose red but the band received is not exactly rose red. It's pinkish.,3
"Writing this review after using these earphones about 6months. First lets talk about its pros-
1. Best noise isolation in this price. As these goes really inside your ears due angled design.
2. Good bass.
3. Very good quality mic. And mic is at really close to mouth on right earbud. So you don't need to hold it to your mouth while calling. Also their is a button on mic whivh can be used to control music and receive/end the calls.
4. Good Loudness.

Now the cons for which i have given them three stars-
1. Treble is really high. And you can't listen them to full volume.
2. In some songs these gets very harsh u can't listen these even at 80% volume.
3. Not recommended for longer listening beacuse of harsh sound and also as these goes deep in your ears, so you will pain after some time.
4. Build quality is not that great.
5. No volume control given on these only one button.

Conclusion:-
I think these are ok earphones considering the price. These have good bass.
If you increase your budget little bit you can buy one more piston fit earphones which have better sound quality and treble and bass is balanced but little less bass. Jbl c100si has high bass and high treble and better noise isolation.
Also jbl c100si and c200si are both same there is no difference just name is changed are also price is high..

"I have used this product for a week, i found it good, very easy to install, it was plenty useful features such as Guest Wifi, Usb drive. But it does not give much signal strength as excepted from a double antenna wifi",3
I wholly like the product but I found that the one I received is not able to function properly with play and pause button. This disappointed me and the next thing is that the phone no. Provided to claim the warranty upon is said to be invalid or the services busy when it is called.,3
"I am big geek of fitness bands and the only reason for choosing this is for tracking sports. I play badminton on a daily basis and this works good in tracking it. How ever, the watch strap is of poor quality with in few days of wearing it, I had faced infection which damaged my skin. Also the screen carries finger print stains which looks messy.. in terms of functioning, sleep monitoring is decent but spo2 monitoring fails quite often. Similarly with the stress monitoring too.. although my stress levels were recorded high, it never alerted with breath exercise. Idle monitoring is good.",3
Batery backup also no good... And most important thing Back camera is not ok....,3
Pretty good for the price,3
sometimes watch doest not viberat or doest not give notification call even if the watch is connected with your phone,3
This phone is decent for an entry level smartphone. But camera quality is very poor.,3

"Received it early morning. Writing preliminary review post noon.
The first look and feel of the watch in your hands - It feels plastic! Cheap! Straps are not upto the mark.

Will share a review after a month's usage.",3

"I returned the product as it was not looking good on me. It's user-dependent.

Functions are good but sleep tracking issue.,3
"After using Tplink A6(v3) for last 13 days, I find its wifi coverage is same as to my main router. Main router has 2 external antennas only. Other features like MU-MIMO, air time fairness, beamforming technology are in theory only. I didn't feel them in performance of router! Nor internet speed has much improved in 5GHz band.",3

*processor performance is not great but good.
*presence of Finger print sensor would be great

worked for a year,3
"Worst battery backup

meh....it hurts my ear after wearing for 20 mins....bass is fine...good for price....and it started disfunctioning after a year and a half.,3
This is a very basic phone with good screen size. the phone is very heavy and there is no returns. You can only replace the phone. be careful before you buy.,3
This router is mainly usefull for those who dont want wifi in different rooms...speed on lan is great i have a excitel connection n having plan of 100 mbps n on lan i got 95-100 mbps....but on wifi i only 10 -20 mbps...n wifi is only cover my 1 rooms properly n other 2 rooms partly not even my upper floor covers...so if u want a good wifi router don't ever go for this router go for some higher range,3
"overall the build quality is good , TP-Link made sure it is ,product looked the same as it is displayed , but the only cons is the range is slightly reducing with in the movement among 2 walls , since it has 5 Ghz it is supposed to deliver the signal much better but the signal strength has reduced to 1 point post two walls . Infact 2.4 GHz signal is much better than 5 GHz , if you are having a 2 BHK with more sqft , would advice you to go after the next model of Tp-Link router.",3
Second space option is unavailable for redmi 9,3
"The headphones while they do work, work very well. Very good sound quality, would score high on volume, noise cancellation, bass, and most other sound metrics. However, it seems they're liable to breakdown, and are not very sturdy, as the left earpad which broke, no longer works.",3
Not really satisfied with the bass,3
"I heard a lot of very good openions on this headphones...
I don't know whom to blame..
The Aux cable is damaged..
And when I connect my headphones to my PC,the mic is not working",3
"Good headphones worth price. Noise cancellation isn't very good but its fine for a headphone at this price, must buy budget headphones",3
"The sound output was ok but the unit started malfunctioning within 10 days of buying, the bass effect has completely gone off. Before going off, the bass was unstable for some moment.",3
"From 2011, I have the Linksys EA4200 which i used till date without any issue through lightnings and rains. Since the count of wifi devices increased, i was in need of a better processor for a router with increased wifi coverage and device handling. Since commercial routers are more feature focussed i thought of taking the least risk buying this router.

Wifi Signal :
Coverage is really good in my 3 storied house though sqft area per floor is quite less. 2.4 ghz at a distance of 8 feet line of sight boiled down to 55 Mbps with which i am disappointed since i used to get the same with my 9 years old router. I was expecting 190 Mbps being my Internet speed in 2.4 Ghz since it promised a 800 Mbps in this band.

For everything other than this, i find it good with my 2 days usage. I will update if i find anything worth mentioning.",3
App is not user friendly.,3
Good printer but problem with print very less print out.,3

"Its a budget and okay stuff band. Visuals are too small for 60+ peoples. Do don't buy for elderly person. Rest is okay that price. 1 bad thing is for charging when you have to remove from band that sucks. Also, it makes it Vulnerable or porn loose and fall in long run.",3
"Earlier i was using tp wr841n router which is of 150 mb speed and of single antenna. so due to its low range which cannot even cover our whole house i then decided to get this so-called dual antenna which they says gives us a good coverage like 25-30 meter which is wrong. Now that i am using this, it only gives coverage to 2-3 rooms which means the dual antenna cannot penetrate through walls and other obstacles and thus as a result gives only 10-15 meter but other than this everything is fine.",3
Average price and phone,3
Good printer in such price.but printing cost is too high.,3
The product is very disappointed in the camera segment. Front and back both camera is worst. It is not as 48 mp camera .Battery backup is well as 6000 mah.only vedio can play up to 13 hours after that phone is dead.if you bye for a big battery only then you can bye this product.all so processor is not as helio g85.,3
Phone is not charging properly plz replace charger,3
"Comfortable and lightweight earphones with well balanced sound. Build quality is okay.
JBL should offer a tangle free or braided cable, even cheaper earphones have braided or tangle free cables.
Deducted 1 star for regular cable and damaged ""Ear Tips"" ( got a pair of good quality ear tips from a small local shop ).

I would still recommend it ( if your budget is under 700 rs ), the sound quality is better than the competition.

Reviewing after using for about a year, still working as expected. Build quality is good, if you can overlook the outdated wire üôÇ",3

Built quality is average, I personally would have liked more improvement in built quality.
You get MS office suite 2019 & antivirus (1 year) with this laptop.
This is not at all a gaming laptop. The ryzon 3 processors & intel i3 6th gen are somewhere equal at performance barrier. For the range of 25k-30k I found this is currently best laptop.
Note: I wanted to use ryzon processor over intel.",3

Products reaoly fast when ther are bo walls in between or you in the same room. Once you put a wall or 2 the 5g is not useable.speed drops to half immediately.,3
Overall i don't like this as a brand JBL it's not that much good and it can be because it's price is less so quality is cheaper,3

Not very efficient,3

And major issue is ads ... They are just disgusting",3
good transmission but upon continuous use of 4-5 days gets it to hang and deliver lower speeds than my bandwidth. so i had to restart and or switch it off for half-an hour for good functionality,3
It is best option under 1000. Believe me you will be happy after getting it.,3

Ok as a wired extender in AP mode. Brings down the speed of internet for the whole network in wireless extender mode.,3
Decent camera and battery life. You get what you paid for. Microphone seems to have some issue. It's not picking up the sound properly when using loudspeaker.,3
Good product. Range is fine. However internet gets disconnected sometime.,3
I bought this on sale. The build quality is pretty decent although its made of plastic. The sound quality is just plain with no treble or vocals. It has little bit of bass and thats it. You shouldn't pay more than 600 for this.,3

"I bought this mobile on the first sale 22 Dec 128 gb version, coming to the phone the miui is the same we find in other mi devices which is the reason I bought the phone but one this which I miss the most in MIUI 12 is the absence of second space(why Mi ‚ùì)
Pros: Good battery, 48MP back camera and MIUi 12
cons: front camera(my redmi note 5 does a better job), no second space, a bit bulky when you hold the phone",3
Front Camera quality should have been improved,3

The dialogue is not clear, even with good audio stream like from a fire stick. I verified the audio works well in other systems for the same video. The digital display is avg. It displays input mode and volume. All the 4 speakers have same length cord. I feel the back speakers should have longer cord.
Over all it is a very average product at affordable price.",3

"Sound quality was good but the plastic was too weak, poor design, I've used it for 3 months and it broke it didn't even fall on the ground, I've used it soo carefully but due to the weak plastic structure it broke and I couldn't use it now.",3
We can't take more than 200copies,3
"The overall sound quality is amazing, you could feel the bass in your ears if you played one with a good bass, the volume levels are also optimum but the ear hurts after 45 min-1 hr of use, you have to keep adjusting the earcup after that just so your ears don't get numb, but for the price, it's a pretty good bargain. I would now recommend these headphones to you if you like to listen to music for a long period of time at once, but if you need just for short terms, then they would be gold for you.",3
"Speed is less , but it's best for small area, less connection",3
"I would not recommend this router to anybody. Its been six months of using this router and I am still facing slow speed issues after contacting Tech support and optimising my router.
5Ghz Band has very poor range, I can't use my Firestick with this band distance between them is hardly 5 meters and when playing prime videos, its damn slow. technical support is not helpful at all too.",3
"It's an okay product, no external noise cancelation or any such stuff. It's good for regular users who don't care much about equilizer and stuff. This is the second time I'm buying the same product in past 3 years since I'm comfortable with it.",3
The wifi signal range isn't that great for the older devices. My 4 year old D link 2.4 GHz router had more range than this. Disappointed with the performance on my older devices. I don't have any devices with WiFi 6. I hope it works well with them atleast in the future.,3
Wifi connectivity getting disconnected again and again I think i have received faulty mobile please check and replace,3
Nice product but there is no bass and treble adjustable,3
Well i expectd the bass to b awesome bt didnt reach my expctation mayb ei expcted 2 high lol.....lacks cmfort cause its too sweaty if u put on fo rlong tym....and most of all its bass is alryt bt lacks clarity,3
Remote control and Bluetooth connectivity not bad but sound quality not good that I expected,3
"Build quality is good, treble is good, bass could have better but it is on the standard heavier side, mid range is poor, vocal will sound low, lack in crisp good for listening soft rock, hiphop and maybe edm's and bollywood remixes.

good buy price ....range coverage poor,3
Delivery time no card payment Soo bad.Very bad delivery,3
Good one but not best in this price.,3
"The print quality is good but I think it is too expensive to buy the cartridge once it get finish. One year happen that I brought the printer at my home but it is of no use now, because there is no cartridge in it......",3

"Everything is good with the product as a watch but the pedometer is highly inaccurate. It counts even while driving, and within house it shows so many steps. Even while running, the distance is inaccurate. Should have gone for honour 5",3
Nice sound,3
"It was delivered a few hours before the time given. I have just set it up and using the HP app on my phone to print, scan and copy. You can email and send documents on WhatsApp too. HP app is impressive. Responds to commands quickly.
Packing was impressive. Unpacking not time consuming. Setting up through HP app on my iPhone was smooth. All functions work well. Connected it to Alexa and the voice commands works too. The only thing to note is the gap between claim of speed of printing and actual printing time it takes. If you are using it for personal use and are not in a hurry the printer speed will not annoy you. It's slow, very slow. I believe it prints not more than two pages b/w in 60 seconds.",3
Bought this with cx180 sennheiser.. product is good but not a match for cx 180..,3
"Expected a better performance.
Built and make of the product is really good. And packaging was really good.
With respect to battery back up it meets the claim if you are not a heavy user.
Experience wise its up to the expectations I mean just friendly. But when it comes to accuracy its lagga bit. There are lot of room for improvements but for the price its really worth going for it.",3
Average sound quality,3
Hi after usage of 2 months all features are fine not that much good and major issue is allergy is on my hand very badaly because of belt of the watch otherwise fine product,3
As per my expectation.,3
One of the speaker producing noise.... What can i do,3
its doesnt have buttons or dial so uh cant adjust it manually theater automatically set bass nd treble if not a bass lover uh can go for this but if uh want bass nd set it manually you can go for zebronics samba or zebronics mambo if uh want expensive than this otherwise this product have good sound and bass,3
Cant see any thing in bright sun light. After 10 days band gets loose and it comes out while removing shirts or t-shirts. During sun light it's of no use it's a wastage of money. Battery gets discharge in a week. It's not detecting nap sleep when we sleep on chair for more than 20 minutes also. No accurate sleep monitoring.,3
My phone heats up so fast,3
"Using it for a few months now in a 3BHK 1100Sqft
Its placed in the centre of the house and doesnt reach the last room! Range is really Poor
the 5G band keeps dropping and is super slow (I have a dedicated 6mbbs line)
the 2G Range works fine
The router randomly does not recognize any mobile devices and needs a reboot to work again!
Not happy with this!",3

"Printer is good, however there helpline number for the installation does not work. Once bought, there is no assistance from Canon or Amazon for the installation.",3
"works only as a pedometer.. other fetaures were not accessible on Iphone. Also, the metal used in the strip was allergic to my skin.. Be careful if u have a sensitive skin",3
"The first thing that came into my mind when I look at the package was it's already used and damaged one. As expected all the items are dislocated. Pouches, thermocol supports were torn and broken. Then I tried to install and play some music. The connectivity is good and also the output was great but you need to put the volume up to 60. Otherwise, your TV speakers would give more sound than the sound system. The satellite speakers are barely useful. They are just normal stereo ones. The overall experience made me lose the trust on Amazon that we might not get brand new items every time. Have returned the item and got a refund.",3
Over all good not bad,3
If you are looking for some good surround effect with all proper channel separation then this is not for you.It is just a 3.1 with little upgrade called as 5.1 with very low surround volume from Surround Speakers.,3
The connection seems to drop a lot many times on this router. Its a good thing its cheap otherwise this router should be avoided.,3
"The earphones got spoiled after 6 months
The sound quality was decreasing gradually and then it didn't work at all.
Totally not worth it",3
"The phone looks decent, the customer service is spot on. Replacement was straightforward. Gud for me as the misses can leave her phone in coverage and the phone tells her about calls,msg or notifications. Without her moving her phone.dont miss and important calls. SpO2 is a brilliant feature specially in COVID times. BP IS NOT ACCURATE. BODY TEMP IS SPOT ON. CALORIES COUNT IS DEBATABLE.
EXCERCISE MODE ONLY SHOWS TIME ELAPSED AND HEARTRATE. SOMETHING NOT USEFULL. NEED TO ADD CALORIES BURNT TO THIS ALSO. WhatsApp msg don‚Äôt show once there is more then one msg pending.
I M NOT BOTHERED ABOUT ANSWERING CALLS AND SENDING MSGS THRU WATCH. I DONT SEE THE POINT IN IT.UNLESS IT VOICE CONTROLLED. THEN IT WUD BE PERFECT EVEN AT A HIGHER PRICE. Find my phone is a nice feature.
Overall decent phone. But this review is after using one phone for 14days and then it stopped working.started doing stuff on its own. The replacement phone is used for 3 days. Review should be done and considered only after a month use, atleast.",3
"It is not good mobile, if suppose we are using mobile data after half an hour

 UPDATE: The battery lasts me for only approx 10 days. And this is with HR tracking and sleep tracking OFF and 2-3 workouts of 1 hour each in a week :( Far below expectations. Also, the Bluetooth range is very limited. Keeps losing connection with the phone. Also has some bug that keeps showing previous days calendar alert from time to time esp. after reconnecting with the phone. Please DO NOT go for this one, Honor band 5 is much more stable and functional.

I have been using an Honor Band 5 for the past year. Now it has been handed over to the wife. I was in two minds whether to buy another honor Band or go for the Mi Band 5. I pair it with iPhone 11 Pro on latest version of iOS. My decision has been mainly based on two factors:

1. I do NOT need the SpO2 tracking - I hardly ever used it on the honor band and don't find any use for it.
2. The mobile app of the Honor band is really bad. You cannot change watch faces via the iOS app and need an Android phone for it. Luckily I had my old android phone and found a watch face I liked and used that throughout the year.

Now, things I liked about the Honor Band 5 compared to Mi Band 5:
1. Sleep tracking - the honor band has lesser battery life compared to the Mi Band 5 but does a great job at sleep tracking - even naps during the day time. Here, in the Mi Band 5, I get a warning that ""Battery life will reduce severely"" if I turn on Sleep tracking. And for some reason I cannot still understand, sleep tracking is clubbed with Heart Rate detection.
2. HR detection - Honor band provides the ability to have continuous HR detection or at a frequency or ""Smart"". Smart conserves battery and it uses some kind of sampling algorithm to do HR detection. No such option in Mi Band - either it is continuous (Battery draining) or it is off. And in the continuous mode, you can go only till max every 30 minutes for a sample. once an hour would have been better for the battery.
3. One thing I've noticed is the Bluetooth range - With my phone in the living room, if I visit the bedroom, the Honor band 5 used to remain connected and I used to get the notifications fine. With Mi Band 5, that is not the case. It gets disconnected within the same distance. Could be an aberration in my reading, but I've observed it multiple times.
4. There is a BUG with the HR detection or the sensor - See the video I've attached. It continues to remain ON hours after the workout has been stopped. This significantly drains the battery - the workaround is to sync the band with the Mi Fit app by going to the home screen of the app and pulling downwards to refresh. The sensor stops scanning after this step. Seems to be an issue.

So I've kept HR detection and sleep assist to OFF. It only kicks in when I'm doing a workout - I mostly use it for outdoor walk and outdoor cycling.

The display is better than Honor Band 5 - at least I find it to be more readable, the colors are great and the watch faces are simple. Weather app gives weather forecast - not that I'd use the band to see that. It's been 3 days and the battery is at 84%. So I have no doubts that the battery of this band will far outlast the Honor Band 5. The strap is ok. I preferred the latch and buckle one of honor Band, it is far more secure. This one, if it brushes against something, it will come off. Security wise, this strap is not all that great.",3
Ink finished in 10 prints only. The cartridges were out of ink very quickly. Something is wrong with the printer. Lets start from delivery. The packaging was not done from Amazon which was surprising to me. Installation was quite teasing task as it took time. The main problem came when I printed some pages and ink finished. 2000 price with ink finishing so quickly. I think one should go for better options,3

There are better options available.,3
"The product is absolutely perfect but Amazon service is not professional. Don't buy this if you are going to shoot videos bcoz it doesn't support mic, Amazon will not tell you this in their description of product.

"Product is good but i was very disappointed at the heart rate sensor it shows heart rate even in air !! Yesterday it shows 39 only and just after 120 !!!
The other factors of disappointed is twist to wake , sometimes it doesn't show the details when i twist my arm , so when i was riding it become useless to see time !! And also delay in income call alert ,and the worst part is step count it count even when i am in bus or car and sometimes it even ont counting, sleep tracking is best however it don't recognize the exact time when you awake in the sleep time.you can see whole whatsapp message one by one that is amazing.
Exactly after 360 days my bnd is not turning on , screen is dead no physical damage.and strap is so good I used it it for 11 months nad it's fantastic",3

"WAN input is 100 Mbps only - If you have a >100 Mbps internet plan, then you have to look for another router.
I am using a 100 Mbps connection and here are the results:

If the team can work on this, it'll be great.

Previous review - product idea is good as backup wifi during product cut, have been using for last 4 days but we have not seen good backup. the backup wifi through resonate is mostly no network or low network. i am not sure how is this helping as backup?? may be its not catching signal cuz we are on high rise building, i am not quite sure of the reason, but for us its not helpful",3

Better buy F&D speakers. Its no way near harman jbl standard . The product i received there is something rattling inside it so i decided to inspect and take a look at amp. It is made of cheap mdf, total 70watt . 15+15(satellite speaker) and 40 watt (subwoofer). Cheap subwoofer is used here .

1.Battery backup is good.
2.Option for custom background wallpaper.
3.Touch feels soft.
Cons:
1.Tracks steps even in bus/bike travel.
2.Display not wakes most of the time when wrist twisted to view time.
2.Band not fits me in medium tight.the holes in band fits my wrist in high or low tight which not gives accurate data.",3
I dislike its quality of product...Its speakers get inoperative in one year. The product comes with one year warranty but how can I apply for it and now who will arrange replacement for me? Can't understand. please reply of any suggestions,3
Overall my experience within this airbuds good but not best because not crystal clear calling & noise cancellation,3
Cheap product wire so cheap cut & curly,3
It's moderately good...sometimes the bass feels surpassing the vocals..but it's good for this price range,3
Good phone in this range but a bit heavy in comparison to other brands.,3
Useful for vital health records,3

And the ink is also very costly...",3
"Good but not awesome, battery life is OK. Though finish is good",3

Stable as been using it since more than a year. But only issue it won't support more than 40-50 Mbps which is an issue for me,3
Not so great,3
"I thought its good mobile use but finger print doesn't work properly i want to switch off and on for when finger print not working, and touch screen was not responding properly when attending the calls and using the apps. Atleast improve the touch screen its will worth for money.",3
When you connect Mi 4 with 1plus 7pro it can only get connected through Google fit. So when you want to see your run or how you are burning through out the day it shows both MI 4 & Google fit. It doesn't show separate burn or kilo meter you run. So the accuracy their is difference. Really confused which 1 is the right 1 to followüôÇ,3
"One side is not working it has 1 year warranty, what should I do",3
Those who want to enjoy music can own this.. but mic is very bad.. not suitable for work from home people who needs to attend virtual meetings.,3
Except to battery good,3
"Exceptional Adaptive Display
Top notch screen and brightness
The latest ui is great
Superb sound quality from both the speakers
Camera is good not the best
100 x zoom is nothing great. Even 10x optical zoom is not that great.

Heating problem. No excuse.. This is the worst experience using this phone. The camera panel heats within couple of clicks, forget about taking video.

Battery back up is not good too inspite of having 5000 mah battery. Can't survive the day.

Also, received 2 times faulty smartphone.
Quality check is an issue..
Had the problem with finger print sensor
Sound quality during calls to the ear piece is not good.. May be a defect.. The second piece had good sound but the power button was pressed inside when I opened the box..

Overall a good phone, nonpardonable heating issues not worth the money...whosoever is looking to buy samsung hold on.. There are other good smartphones going to be launched..",3
The laptop gets heated during charging and its too much,3
"Received on 18.11.2020 by 1030 hrs.
Wore after charging by 1215 hrs, eventually from 19th of Nov-2020 symptoms on my wrist skin started reflecting.
This is quite unusual as it never happened before ever.

Can this be returned?",3
Always connection problem. Everytime you have to install drivers.,3

Hi frnd.. Monopod is ok. But not able to fix the leggs or stand to the monopod.. It has the ball type screw at the bottom. Not able to fix x the bottom stand leggs whatever.. Pls help me,3
Not satisfied with wifi range. Not worth.,3
"Sometimes Does not detect twist to wake up. Detects 8/10 times. Needs perfect position and tightening of belts
Sometimes Does not vibrate or show notifications. 9/10
Low Bluetooth range
Excellent battery life. if not using continuous heart rate monitoring, it lasts for more than 2 weeks
Slow charging
App doesn't show km of cycling, even if location is active
Need to add more watch faces, especially some classy ones",3
All ok,3
"Sound quality in mediocre,bass isn't that great but for the price of 899 I guess it's ok if u need one ,battery life is great worked for 10hrs on full charge,build quality isn't great,i have a feeling it is going to snap qt any time based on its angle",3
"First of all there is plenty of bass. So no complaints on that. But the real issue is, there is nothing in this earphone other then bass. Sound is muddy. Not that clear in high volumes. So if you are a music lover and want crystal clear sound, good instrument separation. Stay away.
And by the way battery life is 8-9 hours on 80% volume. And charging the battery takes a little more than 2 hours

Now let's come to the design. It's good enough for the price. But 45‚Å∞ tilt in the buds do a better job. And microphone is good enough, most of the time the other party on the call didn't made any complaints about the sound .

Byr the real issue is durability, for me it lasted around 4 months. After that one day the left earbud stopped working, and just after three days the right bud also stopped working.

My suggestion for you is, you only go for it when it's available under 500. Otherwise there are better option out there.",3
"Bad network coverage want to use internet need to come out of the house that's very bad
1. Camera waste
2. No finger print

average mobile like basic mobile,3
Makes ear pain if kept for long time,3
It was a disappointment buying this and I have already initiated return. My D link DIR-816 did almost similar job compared to this which is 10 times more expensive.,3
mobile achchha hai parntu charger bahut low hai charging mai bahut adhik time lagta hai,3
Been only 2 months of use but so far so good. no issues.,3
Its okok product instead invest in boat earphones,3

"Redmi 9 powwer has the power of long battery life. Rest, MIUI will remove all the power so I am unhappy with the software. Also the camera is is ok as there are better camera available in same price range. I had budget constraints so had to bring the phone and others in my budget were out of stock.",3
"Very slow, hanging started form 1st day. Worst purchase better buy a samsung or asus smartphone.",3
5ghz range is good ( you will get on same floor ) and 2.4 ghz range is pathetic. I didn't get signal into my second room there was hardly 30 - 40 feet distance. My house is abt 620 sq feet and you won't get signal into every corner of the house on a single floor. On 2nd floor just forget it....,3
The battery life is very impressive of this headphone I could use these for more than a week as I m not a heavy user and the thing I didn't liked is when at high volume there is little distortion in the sound and also the charging speed is a bit slow and I missed the type c port,3
"Good router,but i am disappointed by seller because i received used router and router packet seal is broken.",3
Range is not good. It's not covering my whole house.,3
"There are really bad for gaming. I bought them not for the sole purpose of gaming but obviously when you buy ear phone you would use it for everything. For people who play games like pubg, it's a big no no. You wouldn't be able to hear how close or far the footsteps are when you are in a fight. I used to use the Apple earphones and they are the best I have ever used. While playing pubg, the sound that comes originally from the left comes from the right so it's extremely annoying. They keep getting out of my ears too. The only thing it's good for is music and movies. Nothing else. A waste of money for a gamer.",3
okkk but not best,3
no head phone,3

"Sound quality is not as expected and there is no noise cancellation as mentioned,overall it is average quality",3
The band worked fine for a few months and the display is no longer working now. I'm in the process of claiming the warranty. This might be a one-off issue. But a point to note,3
Volume low,3
Product is nice,3
Range needs to be improved considering the price,3
"BP is not accurate at all.
Except that a good watch but key parameter for which we purchased for my father is misleading when BP is around 130+ it shows 100.",3
Connectivity issue . Auto connection is not present. Call notification issue . Gets disconnected frequently and then one has to struggle to get it connected. Heart rate monitor is not accurate. Rest features and design are good . It has a feature of smart fitness band but with the connectivity issue it is merely a digital watch for me .,3

This router is good but sometines it shows problems like losing 5g network and having problem to connect network.,3
"It's a OK product for the price range. Battery life is good...lasts up to 12-15 days on an average after one full charge...SPO meter, pedometer & pulse meter seems almost accurate.

I did not receive memory card and bag with the camera. Now I am unable to test it. I can see other people have received both items along with the camera. My camera box does not have sticker mentioning the SD card. Canon should have included it.,3

"Read all the reviews but was still skeptical to buy a chinese product. After lot of research couldn't find a better alternative and bought this. It worked like a charm from Saturday till Wednesday and took its last breath on the eve of Wednesday. Suddenly there was no wifi in the house, router had no power light, no change after pressing power on button, reset, changing adaptor to different socket nothing worked. Finally i am placing a return request. Really wanted it to work and support me in this lockdown but it had other plans.
While it lasted, it gave me a good coverage and speed. I was getting around 144mbps on 5ghz in a different room and 149mbps on 2.4ghz close to the router on my 150mbps ACT plan.",3
Printer is priced low however the ink didn‚Äôt last for more than 8 - 10 prints. Had to get it refilled and serviced. Not of great use for people who want to it for major use,3

However, the case is not getting charged at all. I have replaced it twice but still facing the same issue.",3

"I have used this and compared with one of the chip one and found chip one is much better in terms of look and feel, brightness, functions, tracking, reminders and what not. This is unnecessary costly due to those celebrity paid advt.
I would not recommend as such due to lack of many common function and ""low usability"" /user friendly device.",3
"Wifi is the problem with connecting my laptop .one more thing I notice after a bit of print the ink becomes very low.
I think Amazon should also provide the customer care number so that what ever the problem is , it can be solved Immedeatly. Actually when my wifi was not connected, I had a problem to talking hp customer care .",3

"This Wifi router gives good range, enough for 3BHK. This router can only support till 100 Mbps from your service provider as it has 10/100 LAN port. If your plan is more than 100 Mbps then this router may be of no use. I am not sure why TPLink does not mention this point explicitly to customers before buying.",3
Phone speed is not good. Apps and internet taking too long to work. Ring volume is also low. Apart from that everything is ok.,3
"The smart watch drains the mobile battery a lot....when connected...
Its constantly requires permission to enable bluetooth, Internet, location etc.
I have 1+7 and i am facing this issue.
User interface is simplified and has lot of features in it.
Lag is noticable...but i think it can be cure through regular software updates....",3
Camera is not upto the mark,3
Material quality is good but sound clarity is not as expected. Very low sound and bass is poor. Average cheap earphones are equally good when you compare the sound. Only thing you spend money for brand name and wire quality.,3
Some time the volume will get down. Like automatically,3
Mobile app on android device is not able to record the daily activities. Looks like problem with app I have already got a replaced watch. After resetting the device also the app doesn‚Äôt sync properly with watch.,3

I have bought this earphones on August 12 th 2019. And it's not even 6 months the mic went off and the right earphone isn't working.Very disappointed with this.

This galaxy M12 is not upto the mark from samsung. It's just a average one this segment.,3
Good sound and bass quality,3

"Text print and large picture is good

It's get disconnected automatically with the paired device,3
"Been using this device as a secondary phone for my office purpose. Camera is not good, comes with bloatware every time there is an security update the bloatware apps are reinstalled again, have to delete them again and again.

Performance is disappointing, the phone is slow.
Display is Ok but there is a noticeable light leak from below panel visible on screen.

Device is very heavy, thick and long in length making it hard to use with single hand.

I am using it as secondary device, I only use for office apps like MS Teams, Outlook with office admin portal app which gives my company complete root access to device so I am using it only for office communication purpose and I am glad it‚Äôs not my primary device.

Save your money go for other device not this one. I would not even recommend this to gift to elderly as this is heavy thick and slow phone.",3
"The accuracy of the product is very poor. For a one km walk the error is 150 m and it increases proportionately with distance. This also has raised doubts about the accuracy of other measurements. The algorithm seems very primitive. Further, there is no user adjustment provided to set the step size etc which can aid in correcting the reading. The product also does not use GPS when synced with the app which can if provided improve the accuracy of distance measurement.",3
Sound quantity is low,3
Not at all happy it says the range is good but it is not the case a much cheaper product then this gives better out put,3
Remote is not working and Radio antenna socket was damaged,3
The product is not working,3
The picture quality is amazing. But the monitor heats up a lot for some reason.,3
"The sound quality depends on the phone that you are using it for. In general its a good earphone. But the bass and the sterio (sarrounding) vibe depends on the phone for which you are using .. It works well with MI , whereas for VIVO (U10), it didn't suit well (bass & sarrounding was not good)!!",3
The earphones are good but left side stopped working after 6 months i claimed warranty and got new pairs but the process of getting warranty claim was slow it took 15 days to replace the product,3
"Excellent product.No issues faced so far after 4 months of use. Mostly i am using this while travelling . But, if it uses continuously 3 -4 hours ,your ears will starts to heat.",3
Ok product,3
"It consumes too much battery of the phone it's connected to.

Accuracy is low",3
Nice phone ...,3
Sound quality is good.... But it worked for only 4 months. It warranty was given for year but it doesn't show any return policy. Poor customer service.,3
"The phone has charging issues. The phone doesn't charge beyond 56 percent after full night on power. I am struggling to get the replacement. Poor technical service. Be prepared to face such issue before buying. No easy replacement.
I changed the charger. No it is okay.",3
Overall sound quality is nice. I disliked the sudden jump in volume levels when connected to a new device. One needs to be very careful.,3
Durability is a concern. Rest all good,3
"Compared to band 3 there wasn't any major update except multiple screen display and multi modes in physical activity. The dsiplay was a little bit big compared to band 3. The shape of the band 3 was curved which has a great look, but band 4 was provided with rectangular shape which wasn't great. So overall it's not a successor for mi band 3.",3
Not that much good as expected...,3
The router operates at two separate bands: 2.4GHz and 5GHz which is definitely a plus point. The speed obtained via WiFi is great when on the 5 GHz band and is same as the subscribed speed. But the main problem with this router is the range. It is pathetic. Wouldn‚Äôt work outside the room where the router is positioned.,3
"Overall Good...
But,
Music Coming Outside at The Time of Listening (Other can Listen).",3
"Ok .......but only for individual purpose, can't be afforded for any type of office as ink lasts only about 100-110 pages. And the ink costs much ..... Think twice before buying it as it will cost you after every 100 pages...",3
I had purchased TL-WR841 for better range than my existing TL-WR740. I am still unable to get any wifi signal beyond 2 walls at home.,3

"First time expericened an issue with canon printer. Printer error light blinking right from the time I switched it on. DIdn't expect this from canon. I'm assuming this is a one off case, unless this model is only faulty.",3
Fitness tracker is good. But the charging dock is worst. It doesn't hold the fitness tracker properly and the tracker pops out within few minutes and charging stops. You will have to use rubber band to keep both together to charge it fully. Amazon replaced my first unit and the 2nd unit has exactly same problem with which I am sure that each piece will have this issue.,3
"I got the delivery one day before ..
Even courier delivery show me this product to open in front of me .. i like but I got ""made in china"" product..",3
Earphone missing please provide earphone argent base,3

"Writing this review after 4 months of purchase - 4gb 128gb varient. :- A value for money product ,but performance wise is a little slow,because of helio G25 processor ,if it had snapdragon processor itt would work much efficiently..camera is below average ,battery backup is amazing.. So if you dont do much of work and if you want it for your parents then its good ,but if you are a student then you can try some other option ...",3
Better products in this price range,3
Average mobile,3
Ok product. Even with two antennas signal in the next room is not that great. Stops transmitting sometimes. Have to restart again. The configuration is not user friendly. The status indicators are quite dim and you can only see them when you look down upon them. The product looks like it's made cheap plastic and antennas are quite fragile.,3
"Not as expected, Hence returned. Voice is not too good.",3
"Delivery by Amazon was awesome. The display is ok but the touch is not smooth as expected. The watch has health monitoring system which measures BP, Heartbeat rate, oxygen level. The reading of BP doesn't matches with the actual mercury BP meter. The price could have been on lower side.",3
"Mi band 4 faster
But noise very slow and hanging problem also",3

High price comparing with the same specs.",3
Battery not good and hanging problem,3
The printer consumes a lot of coloured ink. I had just printed 8 pages and it showed me a message that the ink is about to finish. In my last 2 prints the colour got changed. I had set green colour as background and it had changed to blue.,3
Display is too small I really disappointed with the display size.thats average product.,3
"Initially it worked fine. After an upgrade of firmware, it started showing SD card as problematic. But recordings are there on the SD Card. The TAPO mobile app is unable to playback.",3
It's my second purchase of the same product. The fist was two years ago. The sound was awesome... This time the sound quality doesn't match the first purchase.,3
Besphone,3
Good value for this range.,3
"I have not in mind to buy chinese phone, but samsung models are not good and costly too. So i buyied this. It has network connectivity issues. Lack of proper video call and network hotspot connectivity. Hotspot range is too low about 2-3 miters. Camera is also average.",3
Band is good but Charger was faulty. Didn't work. Had to buy a new one. Buying online is not advisable as in our case charger was faulty and so the discount meant nothing as for the same price we had to buy a new charger.,3
Nice watch with decent price,3
"according to budget not a paisa vasool device. on screen fingerprint sensor does not work properly. heat during charge and sometimes touch hang.
photos blur after zoom.",3
I am disappoint with cameraüò§,3
mobile look and battery is good..display too better to use.. both camera very bad.. mobile over vibrate on backside while call ringing,3
Phone is good but very poor packaging...,3
"It doesn't backup. I only bought it for the time between the generator and power cut. And it didn't even work for that 1 sec gap. Totally useless. Better purchase a UPS. I bought this about 2 weeks ago, going by the ratings :(",3
Camera quality good but not very good,3
It's not too acurate.it miscalculates the steps while walking and heart tracker is not too efficient,3
Damaged replacement product received.,3
"Sound quality is good, but aux cable quality is not so good.
Buttons only work if connected via bluetooth, and buttons don't work if connected via aux cable. That's one negative thing I can think of.",3
This is average. Spray bottle is not working....pen is not good it is fully dried.,3
"The range is certainly better than my Beetel modem/router that was provided by Airtel and the user interface is marginally better, but the downside is that my WD MyCloud HD has never worked on this router. It worked without a hitch on the old Beetel and I have tried everything I know to do since upgrading and have yet to be able to find my network HD, much less be able to back-up to it or access the media on it.",3
I don't use but I like it nice product and easy to use nice quality and excellent product so far and,3
The watch is over all good but the screen time us very less,3
Price high of such varrient,3
This time product disappointed - in the morning. -it takes -30 min to get signal - not good - may be I got duplicate - I bought with Good Hope - but mod good -,3
There are an issue in colour cartridge after 45 days installing although I didn't take colour print,3
Not bad !!,3
For a budget headphone this is good but vocal quality is not good as bass quality and build quality seems fine to me till now but i am worried because it breaks easily .,3
battery drain very quickly not last even for 3 hrs,3
Overall is good but it tracks your step even on clapping. So that's poor quality of step tracking.,3
Watch doesnt show correct notifications.,3
"Band is good.

But when we travelling in bus or car also, it is counting as steps while the vehicle shakes.

It is not calculating accurately.",3
"It was nice product but it was stoping some times , when we switch off and again on it works gud",3
"The product is not as good as I thought. Though it has double antenna which means a larger range, is working like a single antenna device. Not getting good connection from next room either! But still it depends on the price.",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Sound quality is awesome battery backup is excellent connectivity is good
But Power button not working after few day use I replace this product 2 time but still facing the same problem",3
"I am writing this review after 7 days of use.
1. App need improvement.
2. Heart rate monitor and SPO2 readings are not accurate.
3. Battery backup is not as mentioned, it's 5 days only. I have disabled real-time heart rate monitor & only call alert was enabled. I have never faced this issue with Amazfit Bip watch, the battery backup was 15 days after enabling all features.
I have switched to this watch due to SPO2 & Sports modes, but got disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è",3
"The headphones rather it‚Äôs mic is very average when it comes to online meetings or conferences. That is, the sound is barely audible at the other end.So I am disappointed with firebolt as I bought specifically to participate in online discussions.",3
"Everything is good except that , mic has glitch(radio like) sound, such that I have to turn off the mic while playing pubg.",3
The ink quantity is very very less,3
"Sound quality is good, balance and clear even on fully volume. Bass is average not good. Noise cancellation is really good and clear sound on voice call. Earbuds ear fitting is perfect can use long time no eritation",3
The dual band help and can keep my firestick and cctv on 5.1 seperate band with the lower band for mobile use. Unfortunately even the 5 antennas don't boost the range much. The upper floor still doesn't get decent reception and have to use a repeater still which was the case when i was using a two antenna router. The range on the same floor through walls is less than 10mts,3
I dislike this product due to noise in right side speakers after 3 months then I went to repair and it was found that iC has created problem and replaced it after that I noticed that AUX mode left side speakers no sound then I also replaced Bluetooth module then it was okay. If you think then 500 rupees kindly refund my account as repairing charge,3
"Even if you shake your wrist, it will count as steps and increase your count in walking.

It doesn't track the sleep.

App is total BS. It has nothing to do other than changing theme and it takes more than 10 minutes.

Pls don't buy unless you workout daily or tracking your workouts.",3
"The quality of the product is very average but for this price its ok.. After the use of 1 day.. It one side of the product stopped working, it kinda gave me a shock but after some time it was normal.. I been a boat customer of past 3 yrs and this is my tip for u incase u r purchasing... Keep the warranty card n invoice receipt somewer safe because it never last for a year!!!",3
Need improvement in steps count and battery backup in this device,3
Useful product,3
Not so good.. phone have hang problems.camera quality low,3
Sometimes it needs to be restart,3
It's average product . Not edge to edge display. Music next button tuch not good responsive.,3
"Four antennas is a gimmick,it is not suitable for broadband with morethan 50mbps speed",3
Very low volume in LH side. Its defective one. Idendified after returning time lapse.üôÑüôÑüò§,3
Nice picture OK price. But a horrible stand poor quality . No provision to adjust for height or angle. Didn't expect such poor quality from Samsung,3
"Not too much sound
Sound quality also very poor
But ok to hear with this amount
Don‚Äôt expect more with this speaker",3
"Sound quality is good, but mic quality is not good.
I can't do meeting calls using this buds. Very disappointed with mic.",3
Adopter is not quick charging it took more time as usual. Moreover warranty card and user manual is not enclosed in the box.,3
On product image and I receive product is different but quality good hope TP link provide MI 3 year warranty service,3
"I chose this router for ADSL2, USB, dual antena and reviews.
Set up was easy. Streaming handled very well,when you access it from same room, where router is placed. If you access it >15ft and Wi-Fi signal has to pass thru brick walls, you will experience weak signal and unexpected connection drops.

USB setup was very easy and I was able to access it, thru LAN in tablets and mobile phones. Able to play music and videos like internal storage. But sometime I do experience time delay, to access the folders in USB storage and I have to re configure the LAN to access it again and it works.

Able to connect 4 devices at a time and access within short range is well handled.

On laptop no problem in Wi-Fi range even at 20 ft range and accessing the USB storage files. It's reliable.

I reduced 2 stars only for WiFi signal strength and USB file sharing challnges thru tablet and mobiles.
I recommend this router where less walls and user acess it closer to router.",3
Product is good but price is very high.we can get ups by adding small amount ..,3
Microphone gives a hissing sound to my listner on the other side when i speak ... Overall product to the T .... Amazing sound and battery life ...,3
"so I gave all rate 3 stars but I gave
print quality 5 stars
Easy to install 4 stars
Easy to use 5 stars
BUT
the printer costs 3,299
with cartage
and after like 20-25 prints the black&white cartage is over & now throw that cartage in the garbage and but a new 800 rupees cartage.
same with the colour cartage but the change is colour cartage costs 1200 rupees",3
Average smart phone..easy user interface.. Normal battery and camera,3
"1. Pretty lightweight, which is nice.
2. Display is not as high resolution with clean edges like in the product images at all. So doesn't look as premium as in marketing materials.
3. Step tracking is decent although not totally accurate.
4. Heartbeat accuracy is ok.
5. Awful recharging maneuver. We have to pull the tracker out of the band everytime it needs to be recharged. Pulling out method isn't very clean either.",3
I like all things but camera quality is not Good as much,3
"I used to have Archer C9 AC 1900 which was very good in covering the entire duplex house without any signal lag or lacking the internet speed.

I got A9 based on the reviews and reviewing it after using it after a week. Signal strength is weakening if it finds any interference like wall which was not happening on C9. WiFi speed is reducing to half when using 2.5 GHz connection (which gets activated when we walk little away from wifi router) which is a big disappointment.

Nothing much to brag about it other than easy installation.",3
"I need to tell you guys one thing we cant trust its strap i lost the first band a week back,",3
"Call notification not working, tried many time to contact customer care but no response from them. Replaced the watch but same problem continues. Highly irresponsible service from noise.",3
"Bought it, for the high frequency sound the frame vibrating and creating a sound which make this speaker looks like a cheap one. thought it was an issue since only one of the speaker was causing returned it got another one same issue. Now I am stuck with it. I have Sony 80w which is much more better than this. Now I am stuck with this.",3
We have a two bed room apartment but unfortunately this router cannot provide good signal in every room properly.,3
"USB post is very bad place, Design is not good.",3
sound is too low and bass is also no there. disapointed,3
Very poor strapping pin type method. Already lost this watch in just 15 days after purchase while trekking as the pin type grip came out easily. Better buy honor band 6,3
Working fine,3
"I guess Epson printer is best than this HP 115, I have both Epson L805 and this HP 115 But I feel this HP 115 is delicate. Cannot print sticker in this . Don't buy",3
"1.Easy to configure.
2.Easy to use.
3.It will work with any broadband.
(Note:If your broadband has Username and password login, it has options to configure for it.
You don't need to call you service provider its very easy to do.)
4.Good strength. Faster than an adapter I used previously.

5. Signal Radius is not very large, I can hardly get any signal in my bedroom Which is not very far from where I keep my router.
(The reason why I gave it a 3 star).

It is a satisfactory product and works just fine. I am NOT disappointed.",3
Cartridge given along with printer is having very limited capacity.,3
"Okay kind of earphones. Simple sound, nothing extraordinary. Not the kind of plug and play earphones that will give the required bass/punch/wow sound right out of the box, however has the potential to handle extra bass and Treble. Good Equaliser paired with this can give good results, Haven't experimented myself though. My need was calls and sparing casual music/gaming and it's serving the purpose. Doesn't seem very weak/strong. Durability remains to be seen. Ordered from Appario retail on 23rd Jan got on 25th in Mumbai. Update (28th May 2020) : Stopped working one fine day during Corona Lockdown without any apparent reason. Not reliable. Had bought Soundmagic E10C, months before this and is still going strong, though it is 5 times costlier than this.",3
"Ease of use, good data metrics, many modes",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Noo, there's range but no speed wate of it",3
It's average. It lacks in catching signal nicely.,3
"If the purpose you need it is for short meetings e.g. kids requiring to attend their online classroom session which doesn't require long time of wearing or usage this is a good headset for that purpose.
The battery is small and charging takes long.
Sound quality from cost perspective is good.
Noise cancellation is passive and not that great.
Not comfortable for long wearing since the muffs are not very comfortable and material used is not suitable for long wear as you will start to sweat inside the headphones if you are not sitting in an environment fit for Huskies.",3
Battery is not as expected,3
For this price we cannot expect more. Little noise is coming. Product Quality is also according to the price.,3
I have got product Today and while using same got to know that screen quality as well as touch is not that much smooth,3
"This color is getting stains easily, within one month this color getting dark,footsteps and heart beat count tracking is also not accurate",3
"I bought these along with MI in-ear headphones in August 2019. These are certainly better styled than MI headphones, but MI earphones have a much better build quality and they cost the same.
MI headphones have a metallic body, while Boat has a plastic body.
The Boat headphones stopped working in May 2020 - started hearing a lot of distortion and noise for both voice and music.
I have raised a warranty request - fingers crossed.",3
"For the price it's just a basic dual band router. The range is very bad, the jio router provide better range. After this I purchased tp-link c80, which is much better in range (please note c80 doesn't have usb other it's very good router.) Other choice can be archer A9.",3
"The product does exactly what it is sold for. In times of frequent power disconnections in bangalore this helped my internet to be seamless. Working from home becomes less painfull. However after using it for 1.5 years the battery does not give more than 5 minutes of backup now. I might have to buy a new one now. The product is good, just use a long lasting battery.

I have ordered it again on 17th Mar - 2020 and it has become completely useless today - 18th Mar - 2020. The battery is completely dead after exactly 1 year. Product cost has increased as well",3
Not expected result as they say 1 week battery life but 4 to 5 battery become low,3
"Is a decent product but quite inaccurate with steps and workout...

Shows I've walked steps despite being on the bed sleepingü§î
It counts steps while driving or riding 2 wheeler which is highly inaccurate and messed up.
The band alone is bogus with the distance calculator despite it having my height and weight... Sure it can be a bit inaccurate but more than 500m in a 2km walk is seriously messed up.

I haven't been able to get battery life beyond 5 days on normal mode... Weird

It didn't capture my naps once but otherwise it's quite accurate for sleep analysis

Review date 21/10/20",3
If the produce is being used for short peroid then it will feel. Comfortable but if being used for above 15 mins then definitely tour ears will start paining,3
"A fine watch.
Accurate sleep tracking (short naps as well)
Step counter like every other watch do give false readings but when on any of sports mode through connected gps do give good accuracy.
Very slim nd light weight.
Those having a bit broader wrist Kindly Avoid this watch coz of bit smaller size.
Nice every day features. No alexa as of now
But to sum up all, now a days these features one can get at a lower price point as well. For ex : During sale honor watch ES was at 4999 which i guess is a much better deal, since we do carry our mobile phone most of the times so connected gps also works.
Amazfit seems to confused about its products nd their configurations coz which they keep on launching new products one or other day with same name nd negligible updates. Amazfit is like oh we missed this feature in gts 2 so lets launch gts 2e. Oh we have a competitor in 5-7k lets launch smaller one.
Else those willing to spend 7k on a smart fitness band, this is good choice overall.
Minimalistic features and good overall build.",3
Camera quality is not impressive,3
Not good speed too slow. Exchanged.,3
It's a really good phone.....for kid's and elderly people,3
Some times One speaker sound was chirping like brr brrr so I am not satisfied of this product but Bluetooth connectivity is awesome and remote controling is best,3
One works well (it's been two months now). The other one worked for just around a month or so. Both were kept safely.,3
After a two month subwoofer started making some kind of glitch while playing songs. I want to claim warranty over this product,3
"Ok Product only, not fulfill our expectations.",3
Good product but signal strength could be a problem if the router is placed in one corner of a more than 850 sq.ft area house.,3
"Bought it for my office use... found it ok & satisfactory.....

Although bought it as with my existing modem, my net connection used to get disconnect frequently but found still the problem persist but much lesser..

So I can't say it is either good or bad...but yes it is serving my purpose......",3
Other thinga are fine but Steps and calories not accurate not at all accurate,3
"Worst battery back up
Other features average",3
It's an good product with great sound quality plus good bass but when u listen the music at low volume it has an crackling sound which disturbs the whole thing,3
It is good only for plain paper printing. If you print on glossy paper its color spreads. Buy it only If you want to print on plain paper otherwise not.,3
"Its very comfortable ,and perfect for gaming in budget....but the bass was very average and it's definitely not a good headphone for basslovers.",3
"I didn't like this product,the sound quality is good,the noise cancellation is negligible iy just cancels very small noises which you even cant hear if you just play music,useless noise cancellation, sometimes its L or R earpiece stops working even its just 1 day after purchasing.dont buy it",3
It dont have noise cancellation,3
"Product is good. All the Cables are in the box, but they are useless as they are too short. You may have to buy at least one cable to use this product.",3
Only Good,3
"The main issue is inaccurate distance tracking while running outdoors and treadmill.

Please don't buy this for outdoor cycling tracking. It won't work without a phone. Also for outdoor running, phone is required for route map.",3
"We dont have option to return, if it is not matching our requirement. For this monitor size, Full HD resolution is not enough. Buy 24 inch monitor if you are buying for test related work/purpose",3
The Sound quality of Boat BassHeads 100 Earphones is awesome...however the Mic is a complete let down..i dont if it was my piece that was defective...requesting a replacement. Otherwise the overall product quality of Boat brand is supreme!!,3
Phone is little slow and sometimes it's hange otherwise good everay things.,3
Not good sound quality.,3
"Well a good product
Noice cancellation is good
But not worthy if someone want to go for it they can but you can go for boat rockerz 400 it's better then this.",3
The wifi signal is poor don‚Äôt go for it if you want better coverage,3
Sound quality was decent not as good as I was expecting well in 500 u won't get that obviously in big companies.....bass was not there if purchasing for specifically enjoying music with bass don't go for this....really u will regret,3
The product handy for not so small easy to use is it install and take support is also good and yes some advanced feature is also available here 4 ports for sharing two antenna are just show off the range is not good if I compare this to D-Link speed,3
There is no fingerprint detection,3
Camera quality is poor not so much satisfactory overall phone is good,3
Signal strength is average.,3
This mobile is nice but there is a problem in it when I call someone it couldn't call then I have to reboot it and then it works I have to reboot it at least three times in a day . It's the major problem in it but the camera and battery life are superb. There should also be a fingerprint scanner. I give the mobile three stars from five stars .,3
Day time nice view but not long distance night vision ok 1600 worth k,3
Built Quality feels good.. Smartphone feels bit heavy in hands maybe cuz of 5000 Mah (Samsung M51 have 7000mah weight is almost sameüôÑ) it's been 8 months using this phone on normal uses it do lagüôÑ and display turns black sometimes.,3
"Sound quality is good and bass as well.
But design is poor wire quality is not good enough very thin wire and can be damage if not cared about. Jack is not in L shaped
so overall not impressive headphone.
2.8/5",3
I purchased the device for measuring BP. But is not so accurate about the reading. Hence want to return the product and get the amount refunded.,3
Not bad ok ok produt it had scratch .,3
The adapter tends to get damaged. Router is working fine.,3
"Camera picture quality very very poor.
Overall phone is ok.",3
My coloured cartridge not working after some days not even printed 20 30 prints !,3
"I review it less because it's one ear speaker damage after some time
And it's wire also get damage",3
Response time is very high.4to 5sec delay in displaying time. Step and km is less than the actual.,3
"Good:
Price
6gb Ram and 128 gb memory in this price segment
Battery backup Ok

Bad:
Lagging
Front camera
Weight
Not a smooth experience.",3
"The battery backup only comes for 3 days thevstrap quality could have been better comparing with the amazfit verge the quality of this watch is very bad on the strap , battery backup
hope the team rectifies these mistake through some update",3
Bad product. I have been using MI band 5 for more than 3 months now but don't find it useful. The steps count and the calories burnt is not accurate. I was using MI band 3 prior to this and that was the best in every aspect.,3
ROUTER IS PERFECT THE ONLY THING IS THE COMMITMENT OF AMAZON NOT MEET WITH EXPECTION. WHEN WE SEARCH FOR THIS PRODUCT ONLINE ITS SHOWS THAT THIS MODEL OF ROUTER SUPPORTS THETHER (Supporting App for TPLink Routers) UNFORTUNATELY I NOT GOT THAT SUPPORT. ITS LITTLE BIT DISSPOINTING ME.,3
"I am making this review after using it for 10 days.
1) It is not connecting to my iPad at all.
2)I have to put in effort to connect my iphone.
3) LAN speed is just 30 Mbps for this unit. I get about 80 Mbps on other router I have.

The only advantage this unit has over others is its small size. I choose it for this very reason. I have to put up with these problems described above.

In a nutshell, please do not purchase this unit if you do not have size limitation. Besides it‚Äôs manufactured in our friendly neighbour country so I always have the fear of them snooping üßê (ü§™)",3
"Over all very good.
Only 1 issue I found unacceptable is poor battery backup. Lasts no more than 2-3 hrs",3
"Overall product performance us good only drawback is This is Made in China Product, which is not mentioned in description. I was disappointed to see that after receiving the product.",3
"sir,
i purchased the product 3 months back and the results were amazing. suddenly the microphone stopped working and as the product is under the warranty period i request you to look over the matter and kindly replace or repair the product as soon as possible.",3
"This product is uses last 10 days, it doesn't properly work, when I lift hand sometime it doesn't sens. And doesn't show time.",3
Worst camera quality those who want best camera result or quality from phone then dont go with this phone. And it dont have slow motion too,3
Sound quality is good but it is not comfortable on your ear as the ear pads are very small.,3
"What is more than enough:
Sound quality,
bass,
clarity,
Comfortable

What is not good
- air caps teared after few months of normal use
- few times mic voice wasn't that audiable to other side during meeting",3
Printer to acha he but cartridge bahut hi costly he. . . .,3
After 10 days any of speaker not working but Bluetooth was connected and able to play in my mobile phone,3
Wifi signal is very less on 2.4GHz.. it shouldn't be doing that right?,3
you don't able to refill your cartridge again... you need always buy a new cartridge after empty your cartridge..!!,3
Has a decent range and the speed is consistent! But the router get heated up in some time. Only Dlink 3G dongle can be used in the router USB port for internet connection,3
Printer is not showing black ink level after filling ink and often it does't print even after black filling ink.,3
Print installation and wifi signal is cool.,3
"I am a Samsung lover and being using the samsung phones from last 8 years. Some quick pros and cons after using the phone for 2 weeks are as follows.

Cons.
1. It is having a hybrid tray. You can insert sim2 or memory card(microsd). If you are a dual sim user with memory card than this phone is not for you. You will not be able to insert all the three (2sim + sdcard) at a time.
2. Charging phone from 0% to 100% takes more than 2 hours. Which is biggest issue for corporate users working on field.
3. Screen quality looks like full HD which is not acceptable in this range. M31 and A21 has a better screen resolution than it.
4. About snapdragon processor with 8GB ram it is not so much exciting. The processing speed you will notice is normal like other phones.
5. Microphone is very poor. During watsap video call you may have to speak little loud. It will not catch the sound at the distance of 2 feet. Similarly I did experiment by doing a watsap call from A21, the microphones result was far much better than M42.

Since I am using multiple apps I was expecting this phone to have a better speed. Honestly phone got Hanged and stucked during conference call. The apps got hang. Opening apps takes time.

Pros
1. Camera is far much better than M31and A21. Camera has many additional features like hyper lapse, slow motion and food etc which is nice.
2. Front camera is also good.
3. Strong and long battery life once charged fully.
4. Better in looks compare to M31 and A21.

If your are corporate user who needs to put two sims in one phone with memory card than you will have an issue with this phone. They could have provided fast charger. It doesn't come with earphones.

I am little disappointed with Samsung they could have done better on this price range. May be this is my last samsung buy. Thanks.",3
"This mobile security is very poor
& doesn't support Google pay
Behind reason security
Battery almost good backup
This mobile is ok ok
Only for normal use",3
"Battery backup is fantastic....

Front camera quality is not good...

Finger print is not working properly....

Dont buy",3
Very very bad..pls don't buy..now Amazon also saying not responsible,3
Good but it's ink is so costly,3
Spo2 measurement option has been removed and sleep hours is also not getting measured properly,3
"my ears paining after using 20-30 mins...need to improve in sponge used for headphone . and overall it was really good.
sound quality is awesome.
complaint is only with build quality.",3
"Calling issue on Applications like whats app video call is a speaker and when i turned on the speaker other person are asking me to speak loud, Speak clarity is very low, the battery is dring ..this phone is looking good..
Not to go for this item.. my view :(",3
Sleep tracking is good.,3
"Not gives effect,some what good, it makes my ear heat, go for another product... Bass low, Treple ok,",3
Not cheap on refills,3
normal mobile with powerful batery option,3
"This product is very good, l m satisfy this product.Good product",3
"Good mobile but its made in china manufacture not made in india, so I am not satisfied. I heat china.",3
Received it today. I have bought this for my father. Sound and base is good. Call taking button is rough. Okay okay product. Earphone are fat and somewhat inconvenient to hold while placing it in ears. Wire quality is good. Will post the long term review update later.,3
"The performance of the phone is Good and Great camera but the heating issue hasn't rectified in 5G model. I'm writing this review after using it for 15days . It's gets heats super hot üî• after watching 3 to 5 YouTube videos. I don't why no reviewers has spoken about the heating issues in 5G MODEL.

THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE .",3
"Although product is good and suffice the need for which it is designed. But, battery life is not good. Battery is dead for my device in 17 month. Price is not justified for the duration of battery health.",3
"average bass and average sound... but value for money at this price..i got it in 349
.. giving 1 year warranty.. while mi headset is powerful than this one",3
Looks good. But average quality,3
Print quality could have been better. It is not also able to print half of the claimed paper from the recommended cartridge. Good for occasional use. Not worth the money spent.,3
Good for this range,3
"Not satisfactory.Heart rate monitor and sleep monitor seems to be faking , also workout mode has wrong results.",3
"Not as good as Mi3 band. Sleep tracking is bad, usually starts tracking after 30-60 mins after sleeping. More features but lesser accuracy",3
Sound quality very poor,3
blacks are not as good as i thought. refresh rate is low it must have been 120hz but it is vey slow. when i pkay pc games screen flickering occurs. causing me to dwngrade graphics content to match screen refresh rate,3
Best build quality..bass is low but..ok .. if u'r improve bass quality.. one of the best air buds this price range..and improve touch quality..,3
Pixel density is low with macbook pro. If you want to read text then go for higher resolution. Good for video streaming.,3
"Product sound who like bass very high no doubt go for it,battery 5 hours nonstop using. Phn and music..Charging time 2 .30 hours extra eartips are not there ..Finally noise cancellation not good only in room it's good out side u listen all sounds ...Thank u",3
"Lacks accuracy when compared to Honor band 5......at this price point can't expect much ...sleep tracking is offbeat, step count is offbeat, heartrate sensor is offbeat.....it's good for alarm, stopwatch, timer & for viewing time & date.",3
Price k hisab se thik Hai,3
Bought it for 5Ghz bandwith and for larger coverage however it's good ONLY in the same room for fast speed rest of the house (2bhk) coverage is still slow.,3
"Using it for a week...pretty good....but probably its a returned router, since the way it was packed",3
Camera quality not as well as describe,3
Basic it's not for music lovers low base. For online lectures and phone calls it's good. At this price there are alternativs,3
"Very small watch and compare to it's features, it is not worth for Rs. 6k. Other smart watches with same features are available for half the price. I am not happy with it, and the problem is you cannot return it back. Seller/manufacturer somehow wants to sell/finish his production. Please don't buy seeing the Akshay Kumar's Ad. Not worth it.",3
Quality and all is good but it's expensive,3
This router will serve your purpose. Price being below 800 this is one of the good routers available. There is one cons that being such a small router it does not have awall mount,3
"I use this Monitor as a second screen to my MacBook. The picture quality is good and I haven't faced any issue. The only problem with is, you can't adjust the angle and it stays a bit tilted towards the front.",3
Good product but screen is very small accounting to showing photos on amazon good Battery backup,3
Nothing to add,3
Nice...But after printing 28 hd color print paper ..It got a grin tint isse...When it resolved then a new one arrived. Which is chrome color prints ... I don't know what it's actually happened and one time the scanner also stopped working again buy on your own risk,3
It's average product not so good not so bed,3
Sound quality is ok but have to keep the volume up to hear clearly. More than 60% on the volume scale then the sound is audible.,3
Good smart watch value for money,3
When I started using these headphones initially felt that worth for price...but later on during the usage I found that it's not...Sound distribution and quality are not up to the mark,3
Good Product but took much time for delivery,3
The product is good but the wire isn't as strong. Buy this if you don't tangle your earphone every 2 minutes.,3
"Not suitable for music lovers. Bass is very poor. Go for it if you are going to use it for talking purpose.
Noise cancellation is also not enough as i read in others review. People hear noise of far over call rather than voice of mike.",3
"WiFi range is not that good. Not able cover a single floor, when kept at one side of the floor",3
Good product for the price. Certain features could be better. Need to connect daily and the device settings does not have a feature to remember the paires devices,3
"At general, it gets heated very often even when doing simple daily tasks.... well you had better except this from SD662.... at this price range, I think you should add a 1000/2000 and go with redmi note 9/pro",3
"This device works as both a router and a repeater. It is easy to set up as a router, but as a repeater, you need to configure the wireless similar to the original connection, which was not very apparent. That said, the connection is stable for the most part, as in, devices connected to the router‚Äôs WiFi get a stable IP address. However, the connection speeds are a different matter all together. For devices connected to the router, the speed fluctuates, so even though the back end internet connection is stable, devices connected to this router get fluctuating speeds. This means that you will intermittently get low video quality on streaming devices and bad connection warnings during calls on your laptop which can prove frustrating, even with a stable net connection.",3
"Gallery,call divert options,Wifi hotspot etc features are not working properly.",3
"Looks elegant ..screen is not upto the edges..
What‚Äôs app and other app features not available",3
"Not for performance purpose..Though it has 1333Mhz freq overall but core frequencies are low and that's why it doesn't performs like a real 1333Mhz  RAM,not good for gaming or performance enhancement of PC.But can be used if you want to increase speed in general tasks or want smooth multitasking.Afterall its Hynix and u can trust it.",3
Bought the headphones in March 2021 and was working fine till April end and suddenly the right head phones stopped working there is no damage or incident,3
"It's base is one of the best under this price range but not for gaming purposes. If you are a gamer then in this price range,you should go for another cosmic byte headphones those are more good for gaming as compared to this one.I can listen the external sound very clearly in this headphone if not listening to any audio or video. Although the rgb lights are pretty cool but you should have a pain on your head after playing games for 2-3 hours and it's fitting is not good at all. When the otg cable will arrive I will write a review about it's mic. If you're a gamer then it's not for you but if you listen to any music it's sound is awesome.",3
The charging time is usual as in other phone. The claimed charging speed is failed. Standby battery life also less than claimed one.,3
"Good product. One can use it as fitness band, connected with your mobile and see notifications. There is no function to receive the call or make a call.",3
Sound quality is very good but some noise is coming from subwoofer cabinet. Like lose part hitting noise.,3
It good,3
"The mobile has turned out just as I thought, it is good",3
"Better don't buy
The body of headphones doesn't last long.
They are sensitive and are easily broken",3
Right side of earphones stopped working after 4 months. Now earphones are of no use.,3
Its value for money and bass super...,3
"The head phones are pretty good at low to medium volumes. But when the volume is raised beyond the medium range, the sound cracks and the song is not so nice anymore. It's perfect for listning to speeches or documentaries but not so ideal for music.
The body is durable and of good quality. So, overall it's 3 star worthy.",3
the product works as expected but every day I need to switch it off and on since for unknown reason the router signal drops to zero. I restart the router and after 5 minutes it gives out its usual signal strength,3
Guyz router looks great in design but it fails to performance. The range is worst if you have 2bhk then it hardly covers. It has major range problem but else is good. Speed has no problem.,3
"Not to happy but happy with this
When I wana see the time I think it's 1 sec late",3
Speakers are good. But 1 week later left speaker stopped working. (Maybe quality of wire.),3
Not satisfied with its sound quality.,3
Software installed misses couple of important things in property like maintenance and ink level etc,3
Thish product is nice and better proformenc is better than realme narzo 20,3
Printer is all good and gives me all satisfaction for my work but there is one thing every printer needs a software and there was not cd or any instructions about the software and drives which needed to be installed to use it i will like if you fix my problem.,3
"Decent purchase.Happy with Amazon's pricing.
Product is okay for normal usage(Calls/WhatsApp/YouTube).
Very good battery life.
No flash for rear camera is a miss.
Would have preferred a non Chinese brand although.",3
"Watch design, size and brightness were good. They said 10days battery back up but it drains absolutely in two days. Though mobile was beside often gets disconnected and automatically connects. Delay in receiving notifications. At times though we accepts the call on mobile the watch still keep on vibrating. Noise app has lot of improvements to be made. Overall the watch will be stunning if Noise works on battery, connectivity and app issues. Otherwise it's not at all worth that price. However would like to retain the watch assuming Noise will fix the issues with an update.",3
Its been barely 2 months; since i brought this products after it being recommended by my Internet guy. so far its been functioning perfectly. suhaskatti,3
Camera is not great. Wasgood buy at that price,3
Item was good but this product not given to the calling option it's only smart and sports watch,3
As compared to other phones in this range this device is pretty slow...,3
Sound quality is good. Reduced stars since have issues after using it for more than 3 months for calling. Media playing also has issues. There's lot of distortion when someone is hearing on other side of call. Have operated on multiple devices with same results. Either the firmware is buggy or has issues with the drivers. No updates from company for firmware. Lot of time only one speaker works when listening to music in low volume.,3
"This product is not original.However for the price of RS.350 it's working good.When I wear this for few hours I slightly feel pain in my ear because of the earbuds maybe.Other than that the sound quality is fine and too bad.If you're looking for a cheap earphones with fairly decent doing quality ,you can buy this.Also I would like to mention about the colour which is not the classy red as shown in the pic but the usual bright red which I'm not satisfied with.",3
Really good sound with economic price. Very handy to use .best deal I received ealier..,3
Budget phone.Ok for limited usage....my old remdmi 7a has dual apps but not this....why would they remove it !!!,3
Phone is good in this price range ...,3
"Display quality is very bad, camera is not so good, i did not get headset.",3
Is a good watch but not upto the mark,3
"Let‚Äôs start with the colour, I ordered a beige one which looks horrible and nothing like the one seen on the pack, so avoid this colour. The headphone otherwise is decent, that‚Äôs the only reason I kept it. The device is of Chinese origin and the bass quality is okayish. It‚Äôs comfortable for usage up to an hour for me, the noise cancellation depends on how high is your volume. For its price, it‚Äôs a good headphone.",3
"I highly doubt if its tracking my steps accurately coz I've been using this band since last night 12:30 AM till now, that is 3:34 PM and it shows 2383 steps and I know for sure I haven't been doing anything than just lying down and walking in and around my house!
So kindly fix it please!",3
The printer is ok to use from cell phone but a huge challenge with my windows 10 laptop. Multiple times reached out to the HP cust care and the engineers keep suggesting options which is mot really resolving. One of the supervisor from HP cust care called up and tried to divert the issue and his tone was not polite. It has been 10 days since the purchase and it is Unpleasant experience until now.,3
"When we play game, some time it hang, also bettery is not good.",3

"The Earpads got worn out within a month. The material is not good enough to last at least 6 months.Moreover Sony India doesn't sale Earpads for this product via online or any other online channel.

Sometimes, Sound gets dropped while Bluetooth is connected.

Not a satisfying buy!!!",3
"I bought it 6 months ago. Overall, its a good system however, there are a few issues. One, like some earlier reviews said, bass is really not good in this. Two, sometimes when I'm trying to control the input (fm/aux/BT) the volume instead, increases and decreases, from the remote. So the remote control is not helpful at these times. Three, every time you switch the system on, after switching off, the volume starts from the highest so it starts blasting music.",3
Watch is pretty decent. Battery life is superb. Touch is a bit laggy. Walk & heart rate monitor works smooth. Recommend girls/women's to buy green teal belt. It's ultimate.,3

Sleep tracking I‚Äôm not using otherwise touch and accuracy good one,3
"Fingerprint sensor to me seems pretty good.
Battery life is awesome.

"Difficult to install on wall to guide into screws, but doable.
Poor antennae quality, need care with handling or might break or loosen from housing.
I bought it to replace Zyxel ADSL modem which seemed not to hold stable and would retrain every 5-15 mins after 1 year of using it (BSNL won't confirm it was their fault ever!!)
This one stayed for few hours on link.
But later on kept retraining/dropping link every 15 or so minutes when it does that.
Sometimes is works fine and achieves 3.6Mbps download (I had to lower my BB profile to 4Mpbs with BSNL)
Since this is almost continuous on I observed :

Power-cycled in morning...
In morning 7-8am, it shows good SNR
by 9-11, SNR and attenuation goes drastically down to 13/8.
And either it will stay holding line or keeps fluctuating throughout the day and frequent line drops.
I use corporate VPN almost all time, and it (modem) seems to need a reboot everyday for some reason otherwise VPN has very low bandwidth (8kbps to 63kbps), to almost stop working.

WiFi range not tested much, it is satisfactory for my usage. However, neighbouring WiFi keeps showing up more often as high range than this house one to fool windows os to take time to reconnect upon power loss/restore.

Modem is very slow to boot... 3-5 mintues to lock broadband and show up webpage after 3+ minutes (which shows line not yet trained).

There were no much alternatives in market, thus bought this one!!",3
Getting headache if we use it for couple of hours. Otherwise value for money,3
Reviewing after an year of purchase. The battery life is great and the charging time is the major advantage of the phone. Camera is fine. But the most concerning thing I am facing now is the speaker of the phone. Although I am yet to take this to the service centre . But getting an issue in the speaker in an year is little unexpected.,3
"The Band is very Nice, awesome display and feature loaded. Amazon service is super fast. But charger is disaster. MI should give good quality chargers, band is nit getting fitted in to charging slot properly, when you put it on charge, band automatically gets come out from slot.",3

Not user friendly to install,3
Speaker is good but microphone is not working properly,3
Download speed may were varies suddenly low.,3
Need to improve buds quality and pattern. Also not water resistant. Sound quality is ok. one have to increase volume to high while listning music to get better effects. Low volume you will not enjoy the music.. need to improve bass quality. Overall average quality in this price range...,3
Build quality is not good. Voice quality and finishing touch is also poor.,3
"I bought 2pieces back to back and in one of the two left side earpiece stopped working within couple of days.At this price the product is not bad and we can compromise on the average performance of the headset.But as I lost one headset ,my overall experience with this is negative",3

"I am new to this fitness band culture, so if anyone who is planning to start with this one it‚Äôs a good product, but i beleive it fakes where it tells you that the device can do sleep tracking, how did i catch that ?, as i work in night shift i sleep during the day time so it doesn‚Äôt even catch the record that i have even slept, you will have yo add manually that you have slept,
Most important glitch of the interface you will realise it when yiu use the activity tracker the time when you ride a cycle and you want to us the watch to take click or change music or just use the normal watch, it doesn‚Äôt work.
Once the activity tracker is started or even if it is paused you cannot use otger feature that‚Äôs a real turn off.",3
Nice for gaming and song (avg),3
camera quality is not as good as they presented üòî.. this phone is not for clicking good picturesüì∏,3
Product not worth if u are looking for quality. Uncomfortable experience won ears. I wont suggest to buy. If you dont care of comfort and quality then you can go. Please note you can decide later as there is only ‚Äúreplace option‚Äù . I didn‚Äôt notice and now its waste for me,3
"Phone is ok,it lags while multi-tasking tasks,
Actually at this price range, it's ok",3
Very good to look at but sound is low according to my expectations .,3
Do not waste your money,3
what do you expect in this price range?. mi has bundled pretty much everything in it. plus blue is also my favourite color so if you are planning to buy it just go for it. good phone at this price range.,3

"I use it for about a month now. And I would say it's an average watch. Better than bolt, amazfit bip and all but not up to the mark.
Battery is not as per company's claim but will give you 2-3 days for sure..
Overall I would say who want a decent smart watch with big screen they should go for this, but if you can increase your budget then go for better quality.",3

It stopped working in August, and had to be sent for repairs, the company took more than 1 month to ship it , repair it and then send it back. In March this year, the ears skins begin to come off. I would want an item to last longer perphaps.",3
The wrist sense is utter waste and it's not working all the time and the app is draining the phone battery very fast. The good thing on this watch is that we can get message notifications and we can reject unwanted calls while driving or without taking phone in our hands.,3

New issue with calls: calls will be notified after we lift the call. Sleep tracking is bad. I requested for return.",3
"The screen is very small. The bezels are too thick. Its disappointing to see such a limitation.
The app is not storing the data if you unpair the watch. You have to keep the devices paired all day. This drains the battery quickly",3

"If you want to buy to track your workout it is the worst band. Just have a look.
I do walk 4 km. approx. 4600 steps daily morning, km measured by car and step count by my self. Using this band given a horrible result.
Day 1 in workout mode band used without mobile means without GPS it showed my walk 2.6 km and 2600 steps
Day 2 in workout mode with mobile showed exact 4 km but 3400 steps
Day 3 normal mode showed 1.6 km and 1600 steps. Can u believe 3 different type of result in same type walk. 1600 step instead of 4600 steps is horrible.
So if you want a notification band with heart rate and stress monitor its good but not for work out. For workour you should buy a GPS watch.",3
Works good,3
A white spot at display bottom.,3
It is a good phone. Only defect is its getting hanged at times,3
"It is good but not the best, at this price range.",3
It's nice but cartridge is less,3
Monitor stand is longer than regular monitors. It should have been adjustable,3
Just sounds like rest of the normal earphones. Nothing special about this. I have used other boat earphones before which were too good. But this is the worst.,3

Only just okay,3
"If you know how to remove a few pieces of sticky tape and follow pictorial illustrations to slot in the ink cartridges, the initial setup is easy. What is not so easy is getting HP's Smart App to work. It's an utterly senseless interface with ambiguous prompts and instructions. Once you have figured out that you don't need to 'add' the already installed printer, then you run into a regularly freezing app. Thank goodness for Ctrl-Alt-Del. HP offers no advice or good solutions for their Smart App's freezing problem. There is a workaround though, which I finally discovered after trying umpteen number of things. Terrible terrible 'Not-Smart' app. Print quality is OK. Scan quality is poor.",3
Dont expect good performance unlike flagship phones.,3
not nice,3
quality of mobile was good... but for usage not much worth product,3
Sound quality declined after 8 months of purchase. After around a year right side lost its functioning. Same thing happened with a friend's same model headphone . Sadly I was the one who recommended him to buy it. So durability not good.,3
Wi-Fi range not good otherwise product is good,3

"One-Button Universal Remote with Mic
Quick Launch Access to Google Assistant / Siri

These two features are not there in the model. The specifications given in amazon page is not right. The box clearly says this model C50HI doesn't have any other features other than microphone. By seeing the body of the microphone i dont think there is any noise cancellation inbuilt. also.",3
"This product is good in this price, Battery life is awesome.
Only concern is, it is China Product don't buy.",3
It's very easy to install and tech supports are good but signal coverage are really very poor. I am not getting coverage more than 15 miters. I was very happy with the WR841N 300mbps router.,3

We were not able to connect to Samsung TV due to no option in tv as told to us by tv representative,3
Camera has very bad quality.,3
It's been a week or two since I am using this product....The sound quality the product offers at this price range is commendable...The quality of the wires is also good... Don't keep high expectations for noise cancellation....The last thing is that I don't know it is just my ear or the earphones shape...but after certain time of usage my ear starts paining...That is the only negative thing I have observed about the product....Thank you,3
But the ink provided runs short immediately,3
It looks too small for adults. Automatically disconnects And shuts down if nothing played for a few mins. And sound is nothing great just works,3
sound not split as per 5.1 channel,3
Not up to the mark... Step tracking is pathetic... It shows 140 steps just after coming out from my room (hardly 6 to 8 steps).. Mi band 2 was comparatively better in step counting...,3

I purchased this ear phone about 1¬Ω years ago.. This Earphones do have nice bass and sound quality and i was pretty satisfied with this.. But after 8 months or so..Left side of the earphones stopped working.. As this product comes with a 1 yr warranty.. I issued a product replacement and I got a pair of new headphones of same colour. It's been about 5 months since I got this new headphones and now the left side of this earphone too have stopped working.. I don't know what to do..I checked wheather I could claim warranty for this new one.. But there was no option for that... Now I'm stuck with this earphone ans as lockdown has been imposed in the state I can't buy a new one. ‚òπÔ∏è,3
The picture says it all... Good for the money üí∏... Think before you buy!!,3
"The watch is OK, but the touch is not upto the mark. All Call receiving are not shown in the watch. Battery life is good. Watch strap in summer irritates me, while sweating,as its silicon strap",3
"Look-wise its excellent. But overall bass delivery is poor. But for this price range it is ok. Loud enough, speaker and central system design and quality is good. Only drawback is its poor sub woofer performance. Rest every feature is good enough to compete with any other leading brands. I am using it with philips DVD player for the last 1.5 years. For home, small room it can provide decent sound but never expect a deep bass from this model.",3
"It is Just Ok If you Get this around 500 Then Buy it otherwise Buy Philips Headphone Because Philips has a Good Sound.

"PROBLEMS IN THIS PRINTER :-
IF you use TNPL paper , the paper would get jam very often. Printer is a bit noisy too.
The cartridge placing area and when you load
and lock the cartridge it automatically unlocks and black cartridge which result in paper jam and ink loss. If you do ink flush to fill the pipe with ink in case of removing and re inserting cartridge it would consume 30-40% of your ink within each ink flush .
ROLLER JAM is a common issue
PAPER LOADER JAM is another issue
errors that i received are E02, E03 , E04 etc. This is my replacement product for first G2012 .
It is solely for WINDOWS
No good ink tank printers in this price range other than hp 310 but their services are bad but Canon i think its better but I'm not sure . If budget is around 8300‚Çπ there is no other options available than hp 310 and Pixma G2012 . Overall its a great choice for Students and Office work . Print speeds are slow but decent",3

There are few points I want to mention
Packing is very ordinary compare to previous model of mi band these are just packing like cheap item.
Charging cable is very different from mi band 3 and earlier model causing difficulties when you have same company products.
Battery is not that much optimized battery percentage drops 20 percentage in 3 days of usage I've got at 44% charge now it's at about 20% in just 3 days with ordinary usages and no continuos ‚ù§Ô∏è rate.
The difference between screen and display is clearly visible made it looks like cheap.
Screen is difficult to see in sunlight

All good old school but there was huge difference in price so I had to return. Also don't buy from this seller (appario) not a sport.,3
"The mobile is not getting charged since today afternoon..the return window has also closed,what am i supposed to do??i need to get it replaced with a new phone.kindly look into the matter at the earliest.",3
Heating problem in Phone. Camera very poor. My previous phone was note 6 pro. Camera quality of note 6 pro is far far better than note 9.,3
"Camera quality is not as per the expectations, with 13 mp you get better camera quality but this phone has bad camera quality pics along with phone volume very less. Average phone i would say for regular use but doesn't justify it's specifications.",3
Everything is fine but camera is average not good performance is very nice,3
Whatsapp notification not working.,3
Damaged product was delivered.,3
The product is fine but the sound quality is poor. I am very disappointed by the sound experience. The cable of the earphone looks very poor in quality. The product is fine but I have doubts about its duration of working. Better don't go for it.,3
The ink down in 40 pages of print,3
"Look wise good, will see and provide more reviews on this",3
AUX cable quality is not good works intermittently not expected with the good brand like boat. Bluetooth is good,3
"Sleep monitoring is bad. I woke up for about an hour in middle but it's not tracked. I woke up at 7:30 and removed the band, the heart rate monitoring is enabled, even then it shows as sleeping when I even turned off an alarm at 7:30. I haven't tested others",3
"The product says 75hz but you can get 73hz max with nvidia control panel, backlight bleeding is a problem too, atleast the cost is low that is main pros.",3
Was a good printer...But bad app ui and fast ink consuming,3
Modem is good. But range is not enough as expected. This modem can't be hacked.easy connectivity to bsnl.,3
All are good but it doesn't have a split screen,3
"1. Step count is not accurate
2. Doesn't sync with Samsung health",3
I purchased this product from Amazon at the time of sale. I get this for ‚Çπ549. But the product I received was damaged. After replace I got new earphone. But after a month its earphone jack was not supporting in my mobile. I tried to plug it into the laptop but their also it was coming out easily. It was only working when it has to be hold it with jack in the plug. Sound quality is OK but the product is not durable.,3
It's a good one after 5 days of usage.,3
"Step counting is only depending on hand movement. So, count increases also when u r in car.",3
"It is good, but the range not as expected, I have seen someone use BSNL Rampal
300 mbps wireless router the range of which is just like this and at a lesser price",3
It has been just 4 months but it got broke several times in those four months. I fixed it many times but it again cracks from another side. Finally it got seprated and now I have to use like this because 1400rs üòÖ.,3
I'm using railwire connection only but you have to do configuration. You might need help from Railwire support person.,3
"I used one day delivery and it came on time. The bass is average. It fits good in ear. The noice cancellation is good. Good for the rate. If you are a music lover and you don't need microphone, then i suggest you to use Sennheiser cx180, which has very good sound quality with amazing bass.",3
"The watch is good & does things as expected. But the app is real bad. I guess it shows data on its own will. There are lots of unexpectedly behaviours in the app. Most of the app shows one data & watch another.
One of the major bug is with the sync, let's say I've completed a walking goal of 10k steps& sync my data the next morning, my data is lost & it will never show up in the app.
I've finished 10k everyday, but no data.",3
"Only Cons: No mobile connectivity using USB-on-the-go.
Pros: Good quality printing. Cost-effective and very fast printing. Fast booting, Micro USB 2.0A.

Only A4 and letter size scanning. Good quality photo printing when glossy paper is used.",3
I didn't like it,3
Falls easily nlt suitable fof jogging or running... Noise cancellation is next to zero.. Not worth 2k,3
"good price , ok ok range over all good",3
"Colors ink is not useful, only 30 Page's are print..",3
"When you're in emergency and need a bunch of photocopies like imagine you need 15 photocopies, speed of the machine goes down gradually. When you're at 11th photocopy, job takes at least one min for each copy further. I used office printers before but this one is too slow. Rest everything is fine with this.",3
HDMI cable given as not working,3
"Cost is low but even with low cost, better products are available.",3
"I had a Dlink 1 - Antenna device and wanted to extend its range so bought this 2 - Antenna device but range is quite same, could not see any extension of the range.",3
I purchased this product in August. Now the one side is not working. Even I used it very minimally. I know it is very cheap in the market. But it worked only for just 2months. Very worst,3
It is heavy weight not a slim phone. Looks like an old phone.,3
Giving error of cartridge within 15 days,3
too bad for pc users,3
Camera quality is poor,3
Recieved with damaged package. Product is good despite booting time is slow. Device wifi performance is commendable.,3
Product received 31 Oct box open today due to Corona sefty..one screen scratch found on display .,3
The stand is not stable and it tilts a little towards the front. Really LG needs to look at this because this is a monitor with a high price with all its ranges.,3
"Worth for money in this price range, good sound quality,
Not up to my expectations.",3
"It's a normal ADSL router. Nothing too much special. Range is only a bit more. ... IF range is not an issue, any cheaper ADSL router will do.

Thanks",3
"Bought the monitor(GW2480) for wifey when she started working from home. She is not into gaming, and just needed a big monitor which is easy on eyes. Had the monitor for almost two months, she could stare into the monitor for hours without complaining (and that's a win in my book)

Deducted two stars due to the customer service experience, and not giving us a cost effective repair solution which resulted in more e-waste (we had to request a paid service since the LED panel cracked due a mishap, s**t happens when you have an unsupervised toddler running around the house).

BenQ customer service is a joke. Usually, there won't be any response when you try calling their toll free number (once, I got the message saying that the incoming calls are not allowed to their toll free number!). None of their local service centres listed in their website answers the phone. They have no record regarding the service request I made via their website (I got a confirmation mail). Finally when I did talk to service personnel via his personal phone, he quoted a repair charge which is almost equivalent to a new monitor price since they have to import the LED panel from Taiwan (or was he trying to get rid of me since it was a Friday evening :D The monitor is going straight to recycling eventhough it‚Äôs less than three months old and still in warranty period :-|

Below are some of the takeaways:
* Very nice monitor for your everyday use, BenQ got it right with their ambient light settings and low blue light technology
* Unlike some of the Samsungs and LGs out there, picture is not very vibrant
* Don't expect too much from audio dept; you are buying a monitor, not a sound bar
* When you buy this monitor, you pay for the hardware and not for the customer service

ps: we already ordered a BenQ 27 inch monitor",3
This is perfect for me‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞,3
Camera quality really bad,3
"Itz been a 3/4 days I used this product
Product external quality is good
Voice is clear
Bluetooth 9/10
But when I wear this I always feel like kind of heat in ears well that is not comfortable",3
I have connected my watch with my smartphone but I couldn't get call alerts......I got call alert only for a day since after that j didn't receive call alert.i have also checked about notification settings but still not working üòî do something about it,3
"Its a medium sized speaker, not as displayed in photos, sound quality is Good, not too good. Bluetooth gets disconnected automatically
Sub woofer is good",3
"Product not too good
Wifi signal is low",3
Ink cost is higher than the printer... I but it worth 1500 and original ink cost is showing 1600+ lol...and after using bottle ink my cartridge was damaged fully and it's showing unrecognised after putting in cartridge bucket ...,3
Front camera quality is poor,3
I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR GETTING HIGH RANG. AS IT IS HAVING 300MBPS AND TWO ANTINA BUT IT IS NOT GIVING RANGE AS COMPARED TO 150 MBPS ROUTER OF OTHER BRAND.THIS IS THE ONLY DRAW BACK.,3
"The sound quality and mic quality is not good when connected to bluetooth, it's a bit better when connected to aux. I ordered a replacement for this product because the original item that I received had issues with mic and the voice would not record clearly with several disturbances and noise.",3
You have to keep using it otherwise not work,3
It don't have fingerprint,3
Overall Good for the price but don't expect it to be super responsive and extra features.,3
Product is good but refilling of ink is very coastly and there is one issue in coloured prints and that is lack of white colour printer use yellow colour insted of white in background and that spoils my experience,3
Made in china I thought it was with made in india tag phone is overall good being a budget smartphone,3
Normal,3
All are good but camera is low quality. Poor picture quality. & rest are good.,3
"Little heavy , camera have focus ,screen looks gorgeous, but its has limited function compared to other sumsung product, better phone for parents .",3
On lower sound bass is good. But big sound bass is not good. Unable to connect it to my TV,3
The catridges are too costly,3
I don't feel it's accuracy. And bluetooth also disconnects often. Stress monitoring is also not true values,3
"REVIEW-

You would get better headphones in this price range honestly.For eg,the boat bassheads 900 seems like a better option to me.As for these sony headphones,one side of the headphones stopped working at certain times where I had to hold the wire in a particular way to make it work.I would also say that these headphones are not loud enough for my liking.The sound quality is pretty balanced but I could hear it getting distorted above a certain range.Its a really compact piece of headphones and is perfect for travelling.They would always be in my bag whenever I travelled.They look pretty minimalist too.But as I said, one or two hundred rupees more would give you much better products.These can be pretty good secondary headphones in my opinion.",3
"WiFi signal is so... weak
. only with in a range,and some times is automatically disconnected, I am not disappointed by it, but cable wire works fine",3
"This product is Execelnt for its sound quality but too bad for its plastic quality. The headset got broken quickly because of its bad quality and I'm looking whether it can be replaced or not.
It's the only -ve side I had found.",3
There was no head phone,3
"Gives great strong signal while i'm in my hall/living room. However if I go to my 2nd floor, then signal doesn't even come 1 bar. So take caution before you purchase it",3
This band has very low accuracy rate. Whether it be outdoor walk or indoor treadmill run the stats data is poorly measured. I know this band can't be compared with iWatch but the data which it displays is of no use if it is not accurate.,3
"With just 4 months of usage, product has started malfunctioning after few minutes of operation. It has been working alright earlier. But now, either some component gets heated or some malfuntioning inside box, renders its function unstable after few minutes of powering on. I need to power it off and let it cool down for 5 to 10 minutes. It works for few minutes after power on and then slowly gets unstable / slow or totally non funtional until another power on / off cycle.

Is it possible to get some help here",3
Disappointed with camera quality,3
"Though Redmi advertises make in India, the product (3GB, 64GB) I received is Made in China. Also, there is no finger print reader. Otherwise, till now the set is working. Overall, average.",3
Nice at its price point,3
"Ok product
Not good as expected",3
The watch is good but I face problem of qatch syncing with the app 10 times a day. I have to keep restarting my phone to sync the watch with app whole day.,3
"the ink cartridges are just too small, one black cartridge just gives ard 15 prints. and the noise the printer makes while printing is too loud.",3
Product is not good the IP keeps fluctuating.... It shows internet error every 10 mins..... First i thought its my service provider but after many checks it was a fault of the router...... My connection is working fine on my secondary router this is crap dont buy it...... Plus there is no option of refund... They will only replace the product!!,3
I was happy at first but 5ghz band stopped working...i returned the router. Sad about the defective piece delivered to me but again i went with to link router different model. Let's see how it goes,3
Good printer for occasional house use. Satisfactory print quality as well. Only problem is number of prints per cartridge. It is very very less that what is claimed in the description.,3
Signal drops many times on Universal Repeater & WISP mode,3
"Speed is slow
Camera okay
Battery life too good
All over features not bad",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 So satisfied",3
The sound quality is actually reasonable. The build quality is bad. They claim it to be a stereo system but they didn't even mind to indicate which earphone is the left one(or the right one!!). It's pretty okay for a 500Rs Bluetooth neckband. The battery is pretty good too.,3
Not up to the mark. Display could have been better.,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 working super fine getting good speed also
with you broadband cat 6e cable and 200mbps plan check the video i kept and i got it for 1699rs and cat 6e or 5e both support ghz support but 6e has more ghz speed than 5e and bought 6e for 350rs on local electronics store",3
Awesome headfone bass is good treble is also great but sound is little bit low on full volume,3
"There is a problem with this product. The Whatsapp videos or clicked videos do not open/play in the Gallery. I had to take to the Mi service center and they said that the software needs to be updated. I am unable to understand why such a new product would have such problems. Again I have to backup the files and give it at the service center for updation. They also said that I could have got the phone replaced within 7 days of buying, but how would I know that this is a manufacturing defect?",3
"Pros: cheap price, good noise cancellation, sound quality is average, earplugs are decent fit properly in your ears.
cons: not good bass, length of wire is small

Conclusion: if you are low on budget, then go for it, but if you can go little higher go for Sennheiser CX 180(i had previously, it was awesome)

Songs compared with my current headphone(Motorola Pulse Max): Nucleya - BASS Rani - Aaja feat Avneet Khurmi & Guri Gangsta and Swedish House Mafia ft. John Martin - Don't You Worry Child

Not doubt my current headphone is better(sound quality wise), even after using 2 years.",3
Battery charging processing is too slow,3
I am doubtful whether product is genuine or not. Because sound quality is just as that of average 100 rupee local quality headphones. Wire gets tangled quite easily so that's another negative part.,3
Range is about less than 10 metre. It should be more.,3
Had to return...was fine but I didn't like it..no bass at all..it seemed trebble heavy and made hearing the music anoying..replaced it with similarly priced Phillips base plus and Mi Basic earphone and they work like a charm,3
"Pros
A very good buid and design
Lots of option in sports mode
Battery life is excellent, runs for about 10 days with full brightness on.

Cons
Incorrect steps tracking
Limited faces
Heart beats measurements is also not trust worthy
Sports mode screen goes blank sometimes.",3
Not very useful,3
"The watch may be good at such a price but the refined functioning is missing...
It feels like a kid's toy.
The features are good but the edge is missing.
Will suggest to add atleast 2 new exercise modes weight training and free style training.
The alarm doesn't have snooze,
The watch features are just avg compared to its competitors.",3
"The product is good for this budget. Sound quality with noise cancellation is above average. Bass is average but good. If you get this product within ‚Çπ1000/- then it's not a bad deal. One minor drawback is the build quality, it's not that strong, you can hear creaks when you put it on your ears. Also my ears started hurting in about 30mins of use even though with cushion.",3
Good for a low budget headset. A little flimsy.,3
This app not properly working,3
I found display is the main issue not bad but not upto the mark.,3
short speeker wires...no baas n trouble jack...quality Ok type..looks decent,3
Not,3
The watch is good but we can't pick up the calls when we get connected to Bluetooth earphones. That's the problem in this except that everything is fyn,3
FM was not working when plug in.,3
"How to claim warranty can any one let me know, after 3 month it not working",3
"Its good compare to price. Camera clarity and display very
law",3
Without opening the box I returned it.,3
"Good amount of IPS Glow is there at left bottom.
As well there is noticable screen bleeding, mostly at top bezel.
It's picture quality is exceptional but due to that ips glow it is quite annoying experience",3
Battery lasts very less. A single charge lasts for a total of 4 days.,3
The range is quite good but m experiencing very slow speed compared to the speed i was having with my old bsnl modem!,3
Sound is not good,3
"When you consider its predecessor the 8A/8A Dual, this one is a major downgrade. A sluggish Helio chipset, Type B charging port, an unnecessarily tall screen, bad camera all combine to deliver a not so VFM product. I am saying this coz I have the 8A Dual as well... Not impressed. With every series, there are too many compromises which is very much unlike Redmi",3
Speed is low compared to Tenda D303.,3
Better than LG xBOom 2.1. the draw back is starts with high volume.,3
Tp link has better connectivity,3
Battery backup poor,3
it's not for broadband only for telephone connections,3
"product material quality is very good but, bass not good , and battery backup is excellent...no doubt.",3
"Regarding the delivery, the retailer wasn't responding initially. However, when I found that there is only one day left before the estimated delivery time and order tracker showed that the delivery was yet to be shipped, I contacted Amazon customer care. They reassured me that the order will be delivered within the stipulated time and it really did. It seems that there was a problem with the tracking system, however since the order was delivered within time, no complains are there really from me in this regard.
Regarding the product, it's a simple no frills 300mbps router. I live in a small apartment so haven't really got any scope to test its range, neither do I have any intention to do so. Since its working well within my apartment, any further range will only be an added headache for me. It comes with upto 4channel wired connectivity. So far I have used only a single channel and there is no issues as yet. It boasts of 10/100/1000 mbps transfer rate but I highly doubt that how many domestic users will actually be benefited from a 1000mbps transfer speed since 10mbps full duplex is enough imho. And in commercial uses a limitation of 4 wired channels and 300mbps wireless transfer rate will anyway act as a drawback.
So, far only used it for 3 days or so. I have an apathy for D-link routers since they tend to develop weird problems compared to other routers. I have used a TP-link router previously which was damaged due to a surge. The installation of TP-Link was a breeze. With D-link however, it was again a headache. The router tends to refresh its configuration even if there is a slightest flicker with the broadband. Accepted, having a flicker in the ethernet connection is not an ideal situation but we live in India where everything is far from ideal. I had to replace my RJ-45 plug and after a gruesome installation, the router is working. With this same connection, TP-Link used to create wonders. Currently the product is working without any issues and satisfactorily. But I know, after the monsoons are over I will have to again beg to the LOC to mend the lossy line otherwise the router won't work. In a nutshell, its hard to botch such a cheap and basic router and D-link haven't botched it either. But you will find better products within the same price bracket and you must think thrice before purchasing this product if you have a lossy incoming line.",3
The wifi range is not good. The wifi is not available on 1st floor of a 2 room set. Overall its okay. My previous router from Italy used to give me a really good coverage compared to this one,3
"Battery is good, camera is ok.",3
"One ear stopped working in 6 months. Also, there's a slight grainy sound",3
"I Kall 4.1 channel system delivered, found all the functions are good Except Blue Tooth not working. We have tried with different mobiles also. Can you advice other method. Send 4.1 Manual. Thank U.",3
"All that mimo tech, beam forming, only for advertising. Wifi signal is worse than old simple routers don't know why. This only for close range high speed.",3
While playing video Phone is heating sometimes. Camera quality is not upto the mark. Battery life is good. Sound is extraordinary.,3
Working Good...Nice product,3
Bad but not bad,3
"The description said that if we give a print command, the printer will sense and switch on automatically. This does not happen. Otherwise, everything is okay today - the first day!!",3
"1. I have seen reviews informing that step count is accurate. I am using it since last 21 days and find that the step count ( pedometer ) is not accurate. I am sure about it because I stay in an Apartment Complex and know the exact number of steps in one round. Even the pace of walk ( speed) is not accurate. I am walking >20k steps / day and feel that there is no chance of a mistake in step count through other device/ manually.
2. I am not sure of the blood oxyzen count or the heart rate as I have not verified it with a pulse oxymeter.
3. I have not been able to track sleep duration.
4. Calorie burnt measure is debatable, therefore will not comment. I have found different treadmill counting different calorie count.
5. One may may need to charge the battery more frequently.",3
It's nice product but sometimes I am sad because it has no fingerprint sensor,3
"Exorbitantly priced but has served the purpose in the last 24 hours. Had to go for this only because traditional PC UPS were not getting delivered to my location. UPS is cheaper than this and can support laptop as well. So go for it if you can get it.

I am surprised to see that the date of manufacture of this product on its box says July 2020. How did I even receive it in June 2020 then? That is a trust buster. I only hope that the product performs as expected and has a long life.",3
"Worth the amount
...... Today after 2.5 months my boats one side got silent...... Go for mi earphones.. They are far better in case of wear and tear and durability... My mi earphones had durability for abt 2 yrs",3
"The phone itself is Handy and feels stylish but the camera is not upto expectations to 45mp. I have realme 5 pro with 45 mp camera and it is far better than this ...
Upset with camera quality... fingerprint scanner is slow...",3
I like printing quality but no use for commercial purpose.,3
"It's 3.5/5 overall (considering the price point)
Music - 3.5/5 (not great, but fine, not good for bass lovers though)
Functions - 3.5/5 (remove from ear and put in case, still connected to phone which is bad)
Build quality - 3/5 for case and 4/5 for earbuds. (case rattles a bit).
Call quality - 3 (noise to the other person, keep your volume very low to resolve this upto some extent).
Range - 3 ( can't go above 5 meters if wall is obstructing).
Gestures work fine. Giving 3 stars to lower the rating because it doesn't deserve above 4 star",3
Wifi signal Ok,3
Product is good.Initially looks good ! But can ask me after 6 months ! Will apreciate if SNAPDEAL can arrange for the testing strips at discount !Anyways thank you si  read more,3
Features to be added more,3
"It is good, but if you wear it for like 1-2 hrs you start feeling pain also I choaks up your ear and your head starts paining as your body equilibrium gets distorted I would request you to envest on a good headphone rather than earphone.
Thanks",3
Sound quality is great and bluetooth connectivity is good too so far..Hoping the battery life will be good as well.. overall Gud product..,3
"Overall the product is Ok, but I need to reconnect my phone a number of times to use find device option, that's really annoying.
Even the phone is next to the band some times it says couldn't connect. I need to open the app and sync again",3
I received this earphones today. Sound quality is good but build quality is not good. Its sound quality and bass is better than mi earphones basic. But build quality is not better than mi earphones. Both r same price range. Choose one.,3
"I don't think it's accurate, calculates steps when am in traveling to work. The exercise mode hardly shows I burnt around 100 calories after an hour of rigress exercise but next day tried MI band3 n it shows close to 250 calories üòü",3
"Very good quality printer in this price,most impressd me all in one printer in Rs 3000 I am very happy. Cartridge price is very high, but I will manage.Thank you Appario Retail Private Ltd.",3
My charger is not working and it's in warranty and I want to replace the charger,3
"Looking so good . But not show sleep mode on watch. And some one call me but name no show on watch screen. I am very disappointed this watch , waste of money..",3
Worked perfectly fine for 4 to 5 months. It's unable to completely power the router now. It just is able to power up the router but internet doesn't work. Battery seems to die gradually. My internet works perfectly fine if I disconnect the ups and use direct power input.,3
"Bass too much, cant enjoy in that bass, treble bit low .. Cant judge by the reviews, you actually have to listen to its quality before buying. Some may not like it.",3
Camera quality of front very poor,3
"Sound quality is good, but remote is perfectly not working.",3
"It's a fair sound. The price that I paid Rs799, I thought sound would be better than other competitors but thats not true. I wish I had purchased Boat brand earphones with similar sound effects and best part is that it's cheaper.Rs499.",3
It is awesome products. The sound quality is great and I enjoyed listening songs thought it. Thanks to Amazon that they let their delivery boy use it before and not letting me post a direct review.,3
"I am using this product from 6 months.
It's sound quality is amazing especially it's noise cancellation.
But if you are a BASS lover don't fall on this because it has poor bass quality.
Otherwise it is good product.",3
Onely two months use the phone touch some time not worked Amazon Very poor product onely sales & 2nd product is mixed so no purchase any product by the amazon,3
Amazing phone this price range,3
Is there warranty for this product,3
Battery is drain fast,3
"Ordinary earphones. Serves the daily purpose of watching videos etc etc. Do not expect much just because the brand is jbl. If your sole purpose is listening music with a very descent sound quality, then don't buy.",3
It is slow not responding,3
It is very small and its coverage is also very limited. It was okay as I am using as an extension from my first floor to 2nd floor.,3
"Nice product. However dirct wifi is supporting.it should work with any HP app .
Gett print from phone is a bit of pain
Specially pdf documents.",3
Overall good and works fine. Bluetooth connectivity is difficult at times. Other features ae working fine. Battery life will be around 5-6 days with continuous usage.,3
"Signal strength is very low. Doesn't even support a full 2BHK coverage. Wasted my money buying this, N300 ranges far better and covers 3BHK without any problem.",3
Not good wifi range and packet loss please don't buy,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 it is good",3
Less Price.Very Good response,3
Not that great I would recommend to put in some more money and buy either sony or skull candy,3
Print quality is poor,3
"It's range is same as single antenna router.
Speed is good for up to 10mbps broadband speed, you can have full speed at one bar.
Sometime wall can be problem for getting signal. i'm getting signal on first floor as well, you just have to put it in right place and you can have full coverage in your house.
But for general house user India, I say go for it than any other router for this price range.",3
writing this review on same day of getting product. Immediate observation is used router as SSID WAS BHUSHAN@YOGA_5G than default SSID. WIFI signal not as claimed. It needed extender to get signal on another floor and overall height difference is just 11-12 feet. It was easy to setup. However have to repeat installation for both bands. Not yet needed tech support so more once I use it for few months.,3
Very scratchey screen it catches tooooo many scratch in just a few days Battery backup is good heart rate is ok sleep tracking is good i will rate it 5 out of 10,3
"The reason I bought this earphone was because of the highlight on it's bass quality by many reviewers. Extremely disappointed to find just an average bass out of the music. I tried mp3s with rich bass but it was not satisfactory (not enough pronounced).
The sound clarity otherwise is found to be overall good. But I guess most of the earphones these days are clarity wise alright.",3
Very nice prouduct for office and home but delivary is not good,3
"Although the product has some real cool features which includes the bass, power back-up and passive noise cancellation but the company failed to provide a good quality wire. In the place of a flat wire they have replaced with a normal wire.",3
Scanning is easy whereas printing is nearly impossible as it doesn't connect to wifi,3
"Just 15 days have been passed and it's charging point has been useless,, it's not working. Kindly Change my phone asap.",3
Need to add some more features like apple smart watch to compete the market...!,3
Not As Expected.I have seen such non-responsive app in my life.Even Apps developed by Govt. Of India works better then this App,3
Average product. Frequency of reading could have been better.,3
"Nice phone
But somtimes there are glitches lags
And the fingerprint sensor is decent not very good

Not so good camera but if u swith to hdr mode the camera is awesome",3
It's okay,3
Good printing but catridge is very low to produce more printing.. need to change or fill the catridge after 50-70 paper copies,3
Good but not so useful. Small Screen size .,3
Very Good Headphones by JBL! Only Reason Why Im Giving 3 Stars Is Because Of The Noise Cancellation. It Doesn't Work That Good.,3
"This product stop working after 2 or 3 months, and due to lockdown we are unable to use our warranty facility. Product is not for usage of long term. Maximum 2 or 3 months.",3
"I like this headphones but,this headphones are not able for noise cancellation.. sound quality is good but its very difficult to usethe functions of the headphones",3
"Definitely not the best....it's good at this price...
I feel like the sound quality of the left ear bud is not quite good. I could feel the difference. Sometimes it causes discomfort.

Bass quality is average .
Sound quality is not that good",3
Good bt not value for money,3
"So for its doing good. Already I used beat hr fitness band.
Design is good.

Customer service is very poor.",3
Must contain oximeter features.,3
Printer is fine but it's not possible to get toner.,3
Excellent printer,3
i can't my wifi router since last one week it is does't connect network so what is your service about on this,3
"1) It has nice display. its much brighter if u make it full u will feel irritation in eyes. its that much bright.
2) battery is good will last around 7-10 days as per usage. its not bad because we daily charge our phones so will not be issue to charge this one in 7 days.
3) Software Mi fit is ok good but many times it goes in connecting mode...but its much more optimise.
4) Lot of mi band watch faces. biggest plus point. u will get few third party apps and they hv much more variety of watch faces so big plus for this.
5) in step count i feel its hit or miss..its about 90% accurate
6) sleep monitoring is good. but its risky to sleep wearing band as it cud damage your band.
7) i feel locking mechanism is worst. while driving it got off twice in just 3 days. in and while sleep it gets off once. so it makes me awake.
8) quality over all is great. build is super fine.
9) lift to wake is also hit or miss many times about 15-20%. which is bit annoying.
10) Spo2 is missing which is very important in current situation. Even Honor band with same price category has it.

Over all its nice band. with few compromises.",3
Good product. Decent reception. Looks good. Easy to setup and use.,3

One of my purpose for buying this was not solved, I wanted it for calls. Mic piece is not functioning as desired. It some how distorts my voice.",3
"The modem provided by BSNL along with the connection used to pose problem with multiple devices. I used to get ""this IP is being used by another device"" and couldnt connect to the internet.

This device has cleared that problem, but sometimes when my phone, Tab, iPad are connected to the wifi, my Macbook doesnt log on :-( This requires a restart of either the modem or the laptop. But happens once in a way, though!",3

Average.Normal bass,3
I have 2 BHK only and with my old router (actually that was new) TPLink845 i was not getting good signal in my bedroom corner on my desk (50MBPS connection was showing approx 10-13MBPS) - so my net provider suggested this one with dual band. With this I am able to get very poor signal of 5GHz band and good signal of 2.4GHz signal. But in i am getting 35MBPS. And when bedroom door is closed it falls to 10-12MBPS earlier it was approx 5-7MBPS. Hence not much benefitted.,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.

"Since I do not feel well when the WiFi signal is on for too long I prefer to use the wired connection. When I need WiFI occasionally it is easy to have a button to switch it on or off.

"I have 2 hp printers. Very complex to setup and configure. If you are tech-savvy you may be able to install and configure drivers , still it will be pain . Need to add and search for printers and drivers every now and then, Please keep this in mind before buying. See if there are other options which are easy to setup, else will give you a nightmare",3
"WiFi signal range is very less, it doesn't go beyond the leaving room, I don't get connection in any other room",3
"when you use the router for couple of hours, the speed decreases by half. I realized this mostly on everyday.
I need to restart the router to get the full speed rated by internet service provider.
The hardware of the router seems to have problem in keeping up the speed for long hours. Not sure why....",3
pricing ok but quality needs improvement,3
Phone is good but front & rear camera is not good photo clicked by 48 mp camera is look like 5 mp camera photo.,3
One side ear piece not properly fit in the ear design problem. Not for sport,3
"Awesome product, I still use it through my daily workout session, I Love it‚ù§.",3
"Got it for decent price. But the printer as a whole is not meeting our expectations. While the brand quoted that 1000 color copies can be printed, but in reality we could print around 200 copies and by then the colors would reach the bottom.",3
Touchscreen,3
I like this headphone but it's not very comfortable and now I can't return it,3
"This review is after usage of more than 6months. Surprised that watch beeps for high temperature(fever) when in sunlight(very irritating). Now its hard to charge as microscopic dirt below the watch change pin point will not allow charging. Spending 6K and now feeling hard to digest as even coating on the straps are peeled off. Irritating to check Blood oxygen as it takes time, and Blood pressure doesn't seem accurate when compared with a medical device. Feeling its not a good decision to buy this.
==========================================================================
Gifted by wife as she was concerned in me going out for Job and will be posed with the Covid-19. Selected this product mostly because of Akshay Kumar and used by police personnel who are front line warriors. Happy with the decision to by as i am using this watch for a month and i stopped using watch for last 5yrs as mobile was handy all the time. Cant say economical could have been under 5k but the product is life worthy. I would recommend the product who are prone to covid-19 which gives Oxygen level/BP /Heart rate. Also post covid scenario its helps you in Walking step count/Yoga and multiple exercise model. Mobile app also helps you track sleep/BP/heart rate/Oxygen level/sleep on a hystorical basis(Refer snaps). Product really triggered me to more healthy habbits",3
"Compared to other watches it's good with lot's of functionality but I think I'm unlucky in regards to battery üîã consumption... For my watch it's not long last more than 2-3 day's... Which is claimed for 14 day's... is anyone getting this time period... I think have to improve on battery part... Also if have inbuilt GPS then must track moving activity from one place to another place like NoiseFit NAV. .... Some time it gets hang...
I'm not sure is I'm only getting these issue's or others also facing it...",3
Overall a good product,3
Battery charging time the 2.30 hours. Charging back up not good,3
Not worth buying for INR 700.. Noise cancellation feature doesnt work.. moreover it's a made in China product.. Rather buy a Samsung ear piece directly from samsung website @INR 400..,3
"I wasn't expecting it to be this bad. It is just an average in sound quality. I would not recommend anyone who wants an above average experience. They are okay for everyday use, but for good music experience, they are not the right choice.",3
economical,3
Not repairable if damaged. If warranty then company replaces the whole product. If out of warranty then you can't repair you have to get new one. Local shop or companies can't repair as the parts are not available in India.,3
It's awesome ‚ò∫Ô∏è product,3
Please not buy this broadband for your home,3
Not that good buy this product for 699 rs and its sound is very low,3

Cons;
1. BP monitoring is not accurate, having huge difference.

4. App is having limited watch faces, no option to export/email health data.",3
"This was a great product but it is only a fitness monitor and doesn't come even with the most basic of call and message notifications...since I needed this most importantly, I returned the product...",3
Printing cost is very high. A ful tonner print only 30 copy,3
I thought it would be a gem buy for me. But it is a pain buy for me. My ears starting to pain after few minutes of usage.,3
3 antennas but low range.... That was just like my single antenna d-link router...,3
"While the Bluetooth is good, the FM is terrible. It is scanning too many stations without any reception. And even then, the FM is worser than the FM gadgets you used to get for less than ‚Çπ50 a few years ago, Made in china. I had 3 replacements and still the same FM problem.",3
"I don't think the calories burnt measured by this device is correct.
Last day it showed I had burnt around 1400 calories in a single day. Which I don't think is accurate. Although I had played squash in the evening and gym in the morning. But including all of that my count could not have gone above 700 or 900. 1400 was way above the scale.",3
"Trying to register product on HP supports. But showing serial numbers is not correct.
Seems that not genuine product of HP",3
Nyc mobile for normal useing,3

Technically product works but problem is it stopped working within 6 months and bad part is that you have to courier it to banglore to claim warrenty.. which is not very convenient.,3
Wifi signal is not strong enough,3
Range is very less,3
"I have bought this not a month ago , but one side of the head phone has started to sound lower than the other side , there's exactly now way to increase sound of each individually ... So looks like I will have to return it if possible.",3
"Product is good at this price. Meets my expectations. Delivered on time...as always! :)
Thanks amazon",3
"Cheap and okay product. Size of ear pieces is small, suitable only for kids/teenagers. Sound is ok.",3
Using these headphones for the last two years. Sound quality is average. People around you will start complaining if you play some song on higher volume. Product life is good. With this price range they are good,3
Poor and low sound quality. Not as Expected.,3
"It is not working properly üòë

"Nice product with less cost..this product is not available in the market with this price..
It takes less space and good reception response with dual antenna...",3
Good for home use,3
Very disgusting app .sleep tracking is useless.,3
"Cons:

1. Gets heated up even without using it . (While just keeping the mobile data on)

2. Charging is quite slow. Even after charging it for more than two hours,it was at 90%

3. Adapter gets heated up quite a lot .

Pros:
1. Cost effective for simple usage eg for senior citizens
2. Screen size if wasy to grab specially for senior citizens.",3
It has only good battery life other all are bad,3
It's a nice modem but doesn't covers the range or area as expected rather it covers the same as my old 2dbi modem covered.,3
"As per Discreption on this product i have not received the Warranty card in this box..
Please confirm..",3
Expected life of this headphone is 1 year till it's warranty lasts. It's my experience when I used it with utmost care. Otherwise I was satisfied with the product.,3
Printing is rediculously slow.. feels like printer sleeps and forgets it is printing .. so slow,3
I am writing this at 6:00pm 27 May 2020.I received the headphone on 27 May 2020 around 2pm almost 10 days after I placed the order(as expected due to Covid 19).I used it for 1.5 hrs(in total) and the experience I had was good at the beginning and everything's seems fine.But just after 5 mins I noticed that the headphone on my left ear was not working well.It wasn't clear and was sounding low as compared to right.I don't know if it's a defect in the product but that's the issue I was having so I requested for replacement at 5:30pm(just after 2.5hrs receiving the product).,3
bass is good but need to more bass,3
"Not happy with the battery performance of the product, As compared to its earlier version, I have exchanged it with my old mi phone, Chinese company cheating the Indians, don't buy it, be local buy local",3
Some time Feel Echo. Delayed while playing Video.,3
Value for money but accuracy and sensors not working properly and then touch screen activity not work properly all time,3
Single band so not much speed but reliable,3
"The aux pin and usb sockets are very poor quality. When aux pin or usb is inserted, socket dismantle from it's position.",3
It's performance is not uniform in nature .... Not satisfied completely,3
"The product was good initially. The User Interface was really user friendly. You can set it up on your own without any hassle.
But as the days passed by, I have started facing issues of constant network failure whenever I am in the middle of the game or having a chat on video call. Either the game lags like hell or the video call has constant reconnecting issues. Similar disconnection problems occur while streaming anything but YouTube.

Can buy this item if low on budget or just for streaming YouTube. But if your livelihood is based on a stable internet connection, my advice would be not to buy this product.",3
for me it is not usefel,3
Not that much good size of the watch is too small,3
"The product is overall very good.Has accurate measurements and good display also.Its been 1 year since purchase and the band strap broke into 2 pieces ,other than that no issues",3
Very nice & velou of money but I miss to low prize I bought to 8299 rs. Prienter is very good print quality is very good,3

"First of all, I Requested to return this product but they said return is not possible and replacement was made. when second order was received that was empty by than time period for returning this product was over .so neither this product returned nor replaced.
Anyways using it..
It looks good...",3
Very poor quality as compare to old routers range is poor range in only one room,3
I bought it in July and by September its right ear has stopped working.,3
Nice sounds,3
okay product. bass quality is not upto the mark,3
"I'm writing this review after using the speakers for one week. It must be noted that it's best used with TVs, not for general music listening purpose. First thing you can notice is it's shape - it's massive. It's really good in this price range. Next is the bass which is quite deep and consistent. The quality of the output is entirely dependent on the source. If you are playing from usb/aux you would get it's maximum output quality. It's really bad with mobile via Bluetooth, the quality is really bad with respect to other cheap devices in the market. The most worst thing in this speaker is it's treble, you can't believe - treble is horrible. Also you can't adjust it. Overall this is decent speaker and I would recommend MMS2160B instead.",3
Speed is not much. I went for this model and paid more for N-300 but its the same as N-150. so no use of wasting extra money.,3
It is good smart watch.,3
"Battery and camera is very average and it's lot of hanging while playing games, battery backup is very poor",3

Picture is uploaded the other and i have received other one. Model number and everything is same but device is something else. I have selected the device because of the picture that I saw in amazon. But the product I received is differetn from the picture I saw. So returning back.,3
modem is good and is everything what is described by dlink but only one problem parental control feature does not work in this model. i think it is due to problem in firmware. well hope dlink rectify the problem in new updates of the software.,3
"Laptop doesn't have Lights in Keyboard, So you can't work in Night if you don't wants to switch on the Light",3
"Printer is working well, but provision for two side and odd/even printing is not there. This leads to wastage of paper...",3
This phone is good,3
Phone too heating,3

"It is not a great product. Looks really cheap. Sound quality is alright not great. But for the price it is okay. Battery life is decent. Fairly comfortable.
Overall Good Value for money",3
I didn't receive cable to transfer data from camera to laptop,3
The sound quality is not that great . Overall it looks good. I would rate as 3.5/5,3
"Cons:
1. Front Camera 13MP has lower performance like very noisy pics, low light problem,...

2. Back camera is not much stable, taking money for fake Quad Camera, 48MP is like normal 16MP camera...

3. Fake Fast Charging, it takes much time to full charge...

But still it's a nice phone at price of 9,900 in October, 2020.

I'm still happy... (‚Ä¢‚Äø‚Ä¢)",3
"I bought juts 1 month before, the product was broken then I exchanged after receiving the new one, the problem with new one is same as before. Left speaker is not working properly, sound is breaking, feels like wire is disconnecting.",3

1. With a price of 10k this mobile is quite good.
2. Camera is ok.
3. Fingerprint sensor sense the finger quite fast.
4. Battery is quite disappointing. I'm not playing any game or watching any movies still the battery is getting low. Maybe it'll be fixed after few updates.",3
Average gaming headphone. One can not expect anything best in this price range but it works for emtry level gaming.,3
Camera quality could be better..phone gets heated up while using any moderate application like maps etc,3

then restart mobile and solve issue. & after some times same issues face",3
Quality,3
Everything is good about this product . the price is reasonable and affordable to buy jbl ear phones for such money . but within a short time the base of ear phones wire has been damaged . i feel like company must improve the quality of wire. except the wire there is no disadvantage with these earphones .,3
"Well , I received it the next day which is wonderful.
Nice packaging and all but the product..
It feels good. It looks but it doesn't work good.
The sound quality is average , when I tried different equalizers through my phone or pc I couldn't find any difference between this ‚Çπ600 earphones and free Samsung earphones.
The fitting it nice and easy and comfy but the sound the bass are disappointing.
I prefer to raise your budget and buy sennheiser products. They will always amaze you",3
Camera is Good But Battery does not like 6000mah said by seller or manufacturer it's is very funy,3

Good productüòä,3
"I reviewed this product after 1-2 months. Worst build quality. Price is cheaper but not so worthy product to buy. I used it every day and in a month it's not working properly, sometimes it is not started after a long pause. Connectivity issue in a laptop while you working meanwhile it's stopped in the middle of somewhere. Sound quality is decent. Noise cancellation is working average. Bass is good. Alternatively, battery hours is so good for long time usage along with charging is fast. it takes 1.5hr to full charge.",3
Installation was difficult,3
Nothing wow about this pair of earplug. Very average sound quality and noice cancellation. One of the ear piece stopped working within 3 months of regular use. Expected something better from Jbl.,3
Sleep quality worngly displayed,3

"Great band, if you have Mi smart band 3 then don't go for it, but if you don't then you must try it. Awsome battery power.
(Edit): It stopped responding to touch in March 2020 and order was placed on 13 December 2020.",3
"As it was gifted to some one, later when used it was seen that the cable is broken. Resulting not compatible with many PC applications as it is pausing the music or meeting.
Quality of the cable is not good at all compared to the previous cheaper headphones purchased",3
Hanging issues,3
Good stuff! Especially Really good at the lightening deal price of 599!,3
Quality is not good,3
This band is very good and best in the market but charger is very poor you have to put a rubber band on the charger because grooves on the charger are very poor and they can't hold the band in it and charger cable is very very short and because of charger gooves you can't hang the band with charger or place it on it watch my pics how I charge my band.,3
"According to price not much functions. No GPS, No wifi, no alarm when disconnected from bluetooth. Bluetooth range is very less. No camera in the watch. BP is not correct. Watch faces are less. Band colour is not good except balack one. Not able to read whatsapp messages.it counts steps when I am driving or I am clapping",3
"It‚Äôs very cheap looking and Noise-cancelling is just next to not having, I can hear the celling fan running ü§£ and the mesh covering the speaker are like a piece of cloth just sticked for the name sake. And the worst part is I can‚Äôt return or exchange it even if I asked for a return on the same day of delivery.

26th September 2020- now all the plastic on my headphone band broke up with just the pressure of removing it from head. Don‚Äôt buy it.",3

Speakers and battery are good remaining features not as expected,3
"Sometime automatically it's signal drops.
You need to restart to resolve the problem",3
"Sometimes router is getting hanged and need to reset, frequently.",3
"Flicker sound, some times when i start it the sound cut and nosie in the sound. But restart fix the issue.",3
"Battery -good, Display -Avg, camera-worst,",3
"performance is good, design is not bad, battery life is good, camera is very worst",3
It was nice but after 4-5 months i m not able to take calls from it,3
Stability not up to the standard,3
"Why don't you call my review inappropriate, I don't understand? The watch given to me is monitoring BP and other things from the age Factor. While in the review, the watch has been described as more than 90% accurate, which is incorrect. On setting my mother's age, my and my mother's BP measurement same shows and when I set it on its age, then it shows the beans of both. All images att for your records please.",3
Audio output in case of music is excellent. But very disappointed voice quality during phone calls.,3
"the product is not so good, after 10 days the wireless problem start. but its good luck that i bought it from amazon, they help to resolve the matter and provide me refund without any question.",3
Reasonable and good but the cartridge is very expensive. So it's a false marketing.,3
"The product looks good also it has a very good AMOLED touch screen but the sensors are not as accurate as company claim.
Without wearing it shows heart rate and sleep data.
But the build quality of the strap and screen is just amazing...
Overall it is 3/5",3
"Good product. Good for light use. But it doesn't fit properly in ears.
1st I received damage products but got replacement without any hassle.",3
"For home purpose, printer is good. But ink cartridge becomes empty very quickly. Which makes this printer overall cost to costly.",3
Can buy for using inside home but not outside... Noise cancellation won't helps,3
"Product is good
Signal strength is OK
Been using for 7 Months now",3
Its a good product for its price point. Heats up quite fast and this affects the performance as well as any attached usb dongles. Its not dual band. Has poor range.,3
"Product was so good , but issue with the battery , I requested to return and refund but still I didn't get my return and refund",3
"This router is very good i liked it alot in speed,looks and UI. but its range is like shit i compared it with my old single antenna router and i am amazed that it can't even beat a 4 years old single antenna router in range. my routers are in my room i live in 2nd floor and my main router can reach 1st and 3rd floors with a very little signal so i bought this but it cant even cover whole floor i am not getting signals on other floors thats why i refunded it.",3
I can hear clearly but when using Mic the other person says voice too low,3
"The Boat rockstar has stopped working after 10days, I had taken 2piece one has stopped working",3
It's built quality is not that good but nonetheless worthy product in its price segment. I am satisfied with it.,3
"Average product, think once again",3
"Easy to install and has one of the easiest to use interface but the 5gh band fails sometime,the customer service said they will address the issue in the next update.also it still doesn't have onemesh support so doesnt cover my entire house.",3
Good headphones for the price it is available no issue with connectivity connect very fast but sound quality is not that good but will do the job.,3
All is good. But 1 problem is that when I hear the music with my jbl ear phone. I feel some ache in my ear. That's why I dont like to buy more jbl products. Next time I'll try boat ear phones and Bluetooth ear phones.,3
"The first thing you notice is its sleek design. I loved it.
Its so light weight that I even doubted if it's good quality. Sometimes you want weight to get a feel of something. But yeah, it's a good product from that point.
The screen display and the feel is crisp. I like the colors that show up.
Steps and heartbeat seem to be working fine.
It frequently fails to measure spO2.
The sleep tracking is pretty good. I like the data it displays on the phone app but it gets too frequently disconnected and takes eternity to connect despite Bluetooth and app restarting.
The biggest disappointment is battery. With always on turned off, the battery lasted 76-78 hours on full charge (after unboxing). The heart rate measuring too is set to 30 Mins refresh rate. And off for sometimes during the day.
The skins are limited but I'm not too bothered with a large variety. A few good ones are just fine.
The reminders to frequently stand up and do some exercise are good and come in handy.
I'm yet to experience too many modes and try out several sports that the watch claims to identify and track.",3
Just ok.,3
Bought this router to improve my wi-fi range but sadly it is the same as before ( was using a budget router earlier ). I still have to use the range extender for my house. Only buy if you want the 5ghz signal.,3
"Music sound is good, but phone call sound is very low... Forward / back track sound button not working.. sound increase/ decrease also d same.. that's why I return this Bluetooth ...",3
"What the heck today got a damaged panel monitor! Applied for a replacement

I'll update the review once I recieve replacement.

Update: Ok today I received replacement and it's good, need a month to review",3
This product was brought by me in Dec 2016. working good in initial days. Now a days the internet connection is keep on disconnecting and reconnecting. And i have requested the D-Link to replace my modem.,3
"I used this to extend my wifi signal, but its wifi antenna is not powerful enough to give decent coverage.",3
Sound quality is good.,3
While touch the icon for open app screen is minimisizng often.,3
PRODUCT QUALITY GOOD AND 60% NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION,3
"The product was doing good... Suddenly the ri8 ear pod has stopped working.... Itz malfunctioning.
I wold really appreciate if u guys can get it changed",3
Sound output is More treble heavy than bass. Expected better from Sony,3
"I had a JBL ear phone before this. I bought this as a replacement for my worn out JBL Earphones , and was seduced by the colour and the price. But wouldn't go for this product again. The sound quality leaves a lot to be desired.",3
"Purchased MI Band 5 a few days ago. Noticed that the step count is totally wrong. If you take 10 steps then it is counting 56 steps. Or if you run for 5 km it is counting as 10000 steps and sometimes more. Not sure if customer service is listening. The band needs to calibrated correctly. How to correct this? The purpose of this band is not fulfilled
Other features such as heartbeat, breathing, stress are a good touch",3
For lowest price it is ok.otherwise it's not worth a bit.you can have a Bluetooth headphone for this price but don't expect sound quality.if you want sound quality then go for any other.i will rate negative marks for sound quality..it's ok as a Bluetooth headphone for this money that's all,3
All is 3/5,3
Slow mobile any time hang problem,3
Somewhat Good,3
Nice watch üôÇ,3
Some issue with OS optimization. Phone restart when using some apps like telegram. May be due to 1GB ram also this issue May be after update it will work well,3
Camera quality isn't good as expected but overall nice mobile in this price range with 4 GB ram and 5000 mAh battery life...,3
Not a value for money product,3
product is not good and very poor camera quality and mobile heating while charging,3
"Watch design is ok but software is not up to the mark like:
1. No touch screen. Only face and button press
2. Vibration quality is poor
3. Breathing exercise quality is very poor
4. Sports auto recognition and stress monitor is not available
5. No own screensaver choice

"Good phone for android beginners bought for my grandmother
Pros
Giving descent battery life
Descent quality of screen
Good speakers
Nice low end camera

Cons
Battery heats fast
Small screen as compared to today's phone
Slow charging 5v only

Though it is a descent phone",3
Doesn‚Äôt extend range,3
Highly inaccurate step counter. Defeated the purpose of buying it. Now it's just serving the job of a digital watch.,3
it is not working properly.,3
All is Good but camera quality is not to as accpetion,3
My phone is heating too much and Lacking,3
poor packaging,3
"The product is ok.

But i wonder, what happens if any trouble comes.

How to claim warranty for this product.",3
I'm ok but not satisfied vth bass,3
I m not like because it is display very bad.,3
"The installation with the cd provided was a very long procedure. The instructions provided with are very limited.
The wifi installation instructions made me reset my router which ultimately ended the internet service.
Finally made it...but the wifi connectivity is not good. It takes a lot of time to connect.

The price difference is almost 3000 rs between USB & WiFi.

The plastic looks very cheap.

I have had hp & epson inkjet earlier which was quite strong.

After considering all the above issues I decided to return the product.
Thanks Amazon for processing the refund.",3
"No complaint on device. Device works as expected. When there's no power supply to ROUTER it gives backup to ROUTER. However, not recommended for ACT fibernet users, since the LAN Cable is connected from router to ACT junction box which again requires power backup. If internet source in junction box is disconnected, this router UPS alone doesn't help. Disappointed that, i need to buy a separate UPS/power backup for junction box.",3
Paper jams most time,3

"audio + bass quality is average like other normal headphones/earphones. but the tight fitting hurts, wouldn't last even for minutes on my ear, that makes it completely useless when you want to relax on some good music.",3
Became useless in 1.5 years. Mic is gone. Also it spoiled my phone jack. But I enjoyed in the beginning. Better go for philips or sony.,3
"Automatic call recording not available.
Front Camera poor.
Rear camera 48mp but quality not good.
Processor a bit slow",3

I am not very happy with this product.it‚Äôs my second earphones n same as the previous one it gets less audible after sometime,3
Happy,3
Sleep tracking is average but it's ok for price and about battery in basic use battery drain very fast so i am disappoint..,3
Very good.. But it can work for hardly 1 year or for few more months maybe..I am writing a review after exactly 1 yr. And currently the earphones are not working.. But I think all earphones have the same issue so u can go for itüëç,3
"I've been using the mi band 5 since the past 6 months. Here's my review:
1. Initially the band was giving 10 days of backup but now even after using exactly the same features since the past 6 months the backup has dropped to 5 days since the past 2 firmware updates.
2. Steps are not very accurate, again initially it was working fine but inaccuracies crept in after the firmware updates.
3. Sleep tracking is a hit and miss. Most of the time, it records wrong sleep time. This has been a issue since the beginning.

I brought this band with a lot of expectations but after the initial excitement, I feel disappointed now. The firmware updates have caused all the trouble. I'm not sure if other users are facing similar issues but mine is definitely causing a lot of trouble.",3
"The headphones are good. Quality is ok, not great. But at this pricepoint its acceptable. Value for money product. Just the balance between base and treble is not properly tuned. Should have a little less treble.",3
It is good but smaller than i thought.,3
It has a three year warranty but it stopped working after 8 months.,3
"I have 3 BHK flat, range is not great, it is fitted in lobby and trust me with just one wall you van't get range at 4 meters. so be careful.",3
"Good Enough.

Update after 2 years :
This printer is only suitable for light home use.Not close to office needs.Cartridges are extremely costly and thus refill kits are recommended.Driver issues may be present.

Overall,buy this ONLY if you need to print at home.
There are far better products with a little price hike.",3
"Pros-
-Stylish design
- Range is good

Cons
- No physical button for Wifi turn on /off
- No physical button for Router on/off
- the difference lights doesn't show whether their DSL is working or not
- I don't know why they make those lights even when they doesn't show anything

Overall I must say if this product is under 1000 then go for it else try another product",3
"Received the router before mentioned delivery date. Great service by amazon.

But the router is heating up unusually (Adapter is not heating up.). Didn't connect to broadband. Tested wi-fi for 10-15 minutes and the router was hot. Don't know if it will work full day. Will update here after fully testing with broadband.",3
So much shake on printing..print quality is good..,3
Sound quality is not that bad but gets disconnected sometimes. Also noise cancellation is not that great,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I have problem with my new few days before headphone which was my 2nd headphone but same new headphone suddenly stop working both side no sound and also note I don't have received invoice bill when opened package üì¶.
This was i buy on 2nd Dec 2019 and i was ordered received by 4th dec 2019..",3
"It was easy to install and it took less than 10 seconds for me. Checked voltage and current ratings well before buying, and installing the device. Firstly I missed to find the on-off switch, and without turning it on it will not provide any backup, but the router will work because of passthrough mode. When I tried it for the first time the router went off in less than an hour(not sure about the exact backup time). Checked it the second time for 14 minutes, and the router provided backup without the mains power. This is good enough for me as I needed it for up to 10 minutes between the power cut and starting the diesel generator. Hence, it meets my requirement. I would change the rating to 5 stars later if I see it providing back up for 2 hours. Also, need to check if this device is reliable and holds on charge after a couple of years of use. I bought it to save space, but I think I could have bought a UPS instead. If you haven't bought it already please give it a thought, because you won't have to worry about the compatibility between the UPS and the router.",3
"Overall product is decent only, 5Ghz coverage is below my expectation though performance within the range is good. The other 2.4 Ghz band can not reach beyond 2 walls or barely reaches in best possible condition. I need to reboot the router every 2-3 days to work. The Biggest letdown with this router is NO bandwidth control option!! I was looking for my first dual band router for my FTTH connection and after researching on Internet and YouTuber's recommendation I bought this one. Initial setup and other things are good. mobile app provides easy access to router setting, this all good but NO Bandwidth control, I'M regretting my purchase. I would say it is just overhyped router..",3
Good as aspects,3
It‚Äôs good but after a year the wires became loose so one works and other side doesn‚Äôt,3
The touch is laggy as they say but one thing is that it‚Äôs not how it looks in the photosüòè The size is a bit small and it doesn‚Äôt look grand on your wrist. Moreover the accuracy is not much so I suggest go for some other smart band instead of this.,3
"Bass quality bed but good product . Over all good , sounds is good , bed bed good good
7 out of 10",3
"Pros:
Compact and light
Hangable on wall

Cons:
Atleast I didn't recieve the signal in ground floor after placing this on 1st floor in 1200 sqft site. So signal strenth is weak.

P.S. Amazon need to update the image to match new version C6 Archer",3
"Colour quality is very poor. If you print same page two times, it prints two different colours",3
Selfi is very poor,3
Sound quality is good but the earpads are very bad in quality. Mine started tearing off almost after 6 months and also I didn't use it that much.,3
The button near mic area only functions for receiving calls and not disconnecting them. I have to touch phone to disconnect calls. It is so annoying,3
"Writing Review after 1 month use:

Over all mobile is quite good in this price range but camera quality is very poor.

I would suggest don't buy this phone, go with Redmi 9 Note.

Poor camera quality.
Bettery life is very good.
MIUI 12 (Android 10) is very good. Smooth performance, don't hang with normal usage.
Screen quality is good.
Finger sensor is very quick.

Amazon's 7 day replacement policy is very poor. If your phone has really any defact then only it will get replaced with same model. You can't return & buy another better model.",3
"These headphones just lie in the middle ground they sound just ok, less bass and empty sound stage but good connectivity and usability.",3
"If u are buying it for using it in 5ghz, then waste of money but in 2.4 ghz it works perfectly",3

Battery is discharging badly. It was not expected from Samsung so I rated 3 . The other features are fine.,3
Go for wireless in place of it,3
"Side Fingerprint is not for all user. Battery 6000 mah good, Selfie camera just ok.",3
Sound quality and build in quality is too bad at 70 to 80% volume left ear's speaker starts shaking and there is too much distortion it seems like someone is hammering on you left ear and not at all comfortable. One good thing it's very light because they have used only plastic which can easily break.,3
"With BSNL, this router works for 5-6 hours and then disconnects completely. After that you cannot even access the 192.168.1.1 page anymore. The only way was to reset the modem and reconfigure. After that it works for 5-6 hours.

Planning to return this

UPDATE 21 Jan 2018

The ink given is finished very soon with a print of 50 copeis.,3

"This phone redmi note 9
2nd time display not working so I have new phone or replacement",3

Unable to change watch faces.... did factory reset multiple times and it shows loading and does not change,3
Overall very good phone. But the name Redmi etched on the face at the centre affecfs the visibility of content. Surprised that a reputed brand has done such a foolhardy thing inconveniencing the user,3
"Please do not buy it if you use iPhone, data synchronisation is not correct. Lot of difference when you compare MI band and any apple specific watch. And if you compare it manually Apple is accurate and MI is far lower than the accuracy. I do not recommend it for iPhone users.",3
sensors are working well.but less features are there,3
ROYAL LOOK AND BEST FOR HOME AND SOUND EFFECT IS BEST,3
BP & PR Not working,3
packaging is not so good and they Inculde carry case in bill or product but doesnt provide It,3
not that good,3
"Interface is poor & cryptic. Manual does not explain what the icons in display mean, nor it explains how it must be used.
The companion app Mi Fit and the Band coordination & Syncing is very poor.
Thinking of Returning it !",3
Nice watch. Touch screen working properly. Bt accuracy is plus/minus not working accurate,3
ink gets over very fast,3
It's wire is pretty long which is a plus for me. It's mic is also good it gives clear voice. The only thing I don't like about it is its volume. Is there a bass? I don't think so. If Compared to other headphones like beats then I can say it has almost no bass. You can hear clearly but its volume is too low even at max volume set in my pc and on the headphones.,3
Signel is not too long but previously I used D-Link it was better,3
"It is working fine. My only issue is, as you increase volume, sound quality gets really bad. If you use it 60-70% volume it will work perfect.
It didn't bother me much because for me 60% worked pretty fine. But for its price it should hv worked better. üôÇ",3
"Don‚Äôt expect the earphones to last long as they have very thin wire, also the sound is kinda okay, at this price point you can‚Äôt complain about sound. Also note that mic is just for show and it doesn‚Äôt work",3
"Do not go for it, the priting cost goes too costly",3
"The camera part is horrible.
Only selfish is good.",3
Meeting expectations,3
It doesn‚Äôt have wifi connection should include in this so air printer and other options goes off,3

"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.

This earphone does not cover every type of sound to play as the sound start cracking when certain rock songs are played which makes the quality of music very bad and mic is also little lower which makes the person to caught the mic in one hand and talk not satisfactory product from boat and this is my first bad experience from boat as i always use to buy only boat headphones and earphones.....hope this would mistake would not be repeated from such a reputed company,3
Mobile phone good but hanging problem.,3
Though the printing quality was good for the first few pages. But I have not even printed 20 pages and the cartridge seems to be over.,3
"Every thing ok but scanning problem
Scanning time is too high and not scan every time",3
Unwanted background app this unwanted app use RAM and mobile slow down continually..üëø,3
sometimes its WiFi is disabled itself but lights is still on.It's happened twice in with in a month.Every time it's happened I restarted the router and works fine,3
Band is displaying my HR at about 150 bpm at any time I check. Also 1026 steps in just 4 mins of walking within room. I dont know what to do with this now.,3
You can not set bandwidth limit of your connected devices only you can set device priority. This is a very basic router feature. Don't know how TP link launched this without proper bandwidth control,3
The band is pretty decent but one thing i noticed that heartbeat sensor is not accurate coz it's showing same data if different persons wearing the band and also it's take long time to count but in the it wasn't accurate.so my suggestion is that go for band 5 rather than this,3
Very sturdy phone,3
Nice products on low price,3
Decent quality sound and Comfortable on the ears,3
I decent for the price. But they are not very comfortable if you wear these for half an hour your ears will starting to get pain,3
Colour print is not coming properly want to call for service,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Very basic quality, feels like china headphones and not durable also",3

Not very good quality. Sound volume is comparitively low. Bass is not powerful enough even for with this range.,3

Uuc,3
it is best but it is not satisfied me because it covered miniuam area range,3
"Below expectations sounds muddy but ensure that thumpy bass along with vibration, it depends on volume above it tends to distort and sound start throttling and beg for mercy.

Below mentioned score will justify the Headphones
Bass : 4/5
Treble : 2/5
High : 2.5/5
Low : 3/5
Battery Backup : 4.5/5

In my usage i found this to be average and quite surprised with bass",3
This is overall a okay product,3
This is an average router. Wifi range is quite weak. It's just normal. My earlier Huwai router good range. Please go with Ausus. Or go with c6 will less money,3
DISLIKE,3
Cannot wall mount this router is the main draw back. Speed is good but still does not cover whole of 1bhk,3
Camera Quality not good don't buy this phone.,3
I disappointed with charging everyday and my mobile always in bluetooth enable which will impact on battery cahrge down.,3
No USB connection is biggest flaw.,3

Nothing special.... Bluetooth connectivity is really good....in this part only I am happy, then nothing else.... Somewhat I am fed up only....",3
"Looks great, working properly, unlike fitbit varsa which I am using it for more than 1 yr., If you move your hands bolt is not counting as steps.. at this range, product offers gr8 features.",3
It is the best phone in this price....,3
"The sound quality is really, worth for the money.
The bass is quite OK,but the noise cancellation is not good.
All over the product is worth for money.",3
"I like face unlocking, i didnt like camera picture quality",3
Sound quality is not good.,3
If you have a Mi band 3 don't upgrade! There is no big difference except for color display and music control. I returned the product because the adapter which they are giving to charge the tracker is too bad! I felt frustrated to adjust the tracker on that adapter. It can easily come out of it. At least for the next version they have to provide USB charging! Overall this bend is avarag,3
"Like
Last four year I use",3
"I ordered this phone day after today and it has been delivered to me. I did not like this phone at all because this phone heats up quickly and the sound of the phone speaker is also very low. Therefore, I would suggest that you spend more than 2000 rupees. And buy other smartphones of Realme.
But in this MRP it is good",3
used for 2.5 yrs . for 2 yrs it worked just fine. Circuits can be easily damaged with slight power fluctuation. nowdays its working very badly takes 2-3 min to connect. one of LAN light is always on(even is not connected),3
"Ok ok ,not soo better go for samsung ...
Nothing about this product 3.8 rating
open light camera is good 5 rating
But inside house camera 2.5
U decide",3
"Sound quality too good, however mic creating issue after 15- 20 days, the person on line can't hear you also too much disturbance arises, raised complaint at boat, nobody turned up",3
Ink charging problem is showing.i have charged the ink more than 3 hrs but not working,3
Wires frayed within 9 months near the Mike.,3
"Bluetooth connectivity is good.
Soundd quality is OK",3
"Its ok to buy this for 499 sound quality is average if you are a music lover sorry this is not for you..
And worst part is you can't put it so long after certain period of time your ears start complaining about that. So go for over ears",3
"delivery was pretty good.
printer is good, print quality is much better.
single paper struck inside printer, not holding a single paper.
can print every type of paper.
but cartridge problem.
after filling my colour cartridge 4 to 5 times its showing that cartridge is not working.",3
Good but not meet our expectations,3
It is good but not best,3
"Pros:
1. C type charging
2. 5000 mah battery
3.soild build& in hand feeling
Cons:
1.Camera could be little dissapointing..
2.Display isn't tht great
Verdict:
If u r looking a phone which has to be performace oriented u can consider this one.
Otherelse.",3
"Amazing device good sound quality..
Rear camera is good
Battery life is better",3
"Previously, its range was very good. It converted 1 MBPS to about 25-30 MBPS. Now the range is reduced and speed is reduced. It could now give max speed of 5 MBPS. After about one month, the speed and range are reduced. Other than that, the router is good.",3
The Charging Is Not Upto The Mark.. Without doing nothing calories are increasing..,3
Battery Backup is disappointing. It only stands for 3.5 days. All other features are good. The product is good but the battery backup is the main reason for returning this product.,3
Waste of money plz don't buy the item no bass and satlight speakers is no bass and dirstbance the sound,3
"really worth mobile for the price, but charging port issues, still now 2 times servicing done.....very delicate mobiles.....",3
Touch not accurate. Lag while app's opening. Front camera is average.,3
Battery is not good. Disappointed,3
"Everything is good but it will stop functioning in right or left side in just 3 months coz it did to me, it stopped functioning on the right side, the company has designed the product in such a way that it malfunctions in a short time so that u buy a new one, advantage for the company.",3
Product is good. Sound quality is nice. Noice cancellation is ok not great. My main purpose to buy this to take office calls uninterrupted with noice cancellation. Unfortunately very annoying thing is this gets disconnect from laptop abruptly. You have to switch off and on again to connect back. Very uncomfortable while taking office calls. With phone there is no issue it‚Äôs great. For long hours bit sweaty it would be,3
This product fits well. It does some level of noise cancellation. But sound quality is not up to the mark or even does not do any justice to the name of this headset. The name Blast sounds really funny once you start using this headset.,3
Using for last 2 months. Overall good performance except limited watch faces and music control was poor... Accuracy getting average,3
"Sound quality is too good.
But don't support noise cancellation
Body finished is not good",3
"I can't give more than three star for this product.
Because the sound isn't very well for this much price.
But in charge it is best.",3

"Looking good but slow slag , waste mobile dont buy high ram starting price 7000 better 9000 price is waste dont buy",3
Phone is very heavy and becomes uncomfortable to hold during a long call.. camera quality is also sub par,3
"Slightly overpriced. Comfortable, even when wearing spectacles. Microphone doesn't work all the time, stops working suddenly.",3
"The earphones by themselves are really good in every aspect but, mine stopped working after three months.
Luckily they were under warranty and the customer service was really good, got a replacement immediately.
Unfortunately got a colour replacement too.",3
Display is not working properly and blood pressure is not showing correctly if possible do something,3
Look is quite attractive but features not up to the mark in 3000 its a good deal.,3

"Good product
Not able to select color from the cart, it's automatically adding black color to buy the product.",3
Packaging was worst..,3
This item was digital,3
Thermometer üå°Ô∏è give wrong informations,3
Battery backup is not as promised. It last for 3 to 4 days. If we turn off all day tracking features off then it last 5 days only,3
NOT bad,3
"It is not upto the mark.
The biggest drawback is that it starts to say low battery continuously below 30% battery and we are not able to hear the audio of oir system application.
This mean effective battery = 100-30= 70%",3
I will not prefer this earphone because boat say 1 year warranty but when I claimed they have accepted and send a message that they will come and replace it but no one came and the earphone after 3 month was not working so I will prefer to buy mi earphone please buy mi earphone,3
"Router is good but there is no return option available. Before I open this router, i got another one from another source. Thought I would return it but there is no option for return. Too sad",3
Surpeb all things,3
i dont know anybody notice or not but the dial is not 1.69 its 1.45 cuz of chin its only visible to 1.45 so lets be in mind otherwise decent battry life and some time notificition is come late,3
"Headphones worked well for about 6 months however now I don‚Äôt hear any sound from the left earpiece. It‚Äôs very irritating.
Looks like it‚Äôs time to buy a new one",3
Valuable price and good product,3
Good so far. Got it from cred. Will update with a detailed review once I use it for a month.,3
"Awesome mobile, performance, battery and camra all are Jabardast.... But an arror found in mobile.... When I connect it to head phone.... One side speaker does not work.... This arror is from factory manufacturing",3
Better printer for daily use,3
"Only disadvantage of this ear phone is that mic is situated way below, during call you have to lift the mic near to your mouth or else your voice won't be audible.",3
"I used it for 2 days and realized that it not for me. I am a big fan of mi and also kinda biased for MI. But this watch did not fulfill my requirements.
the custom watch faces are good but I didn't really like all of them, the features are good, workout trackers are very good in this but there are 2 problems in this band that I can not ignore.
The first one is the sleep tracker, it works only in the night, if you are sleeping in the day it will not show any data of it. All though you can set it up manually for the day in the app but it didn't work, it failed to give any data about my sleep. I tried to uninstall and install the app many times as the customer care suggested but still facing problems with the sleep data, so I am returning it.
another flaw is if you go out in daylight, you will see a violet color tint (like a color strip) at the bottom edge of the band all the time and that is very distracting",3
average product.,3
Not easy to fix this painter I face so many ERROR like E04 E03 E02 but print quality is good and peint speed is awesome bcz less than 30 second you got your colour copy,3
quite good,3
Good buy fit and finish is not that good at the level of price and quality is poor but signals strength is good. Improve the finishing of router as the level of price.,3
"Cons: No fingerprint sensor.
No Widevine L1 support.
Not a good camera at all. Photos captured are blurry and unclear. Totally disappointed with the camera.
Too many MI built in apps which reduces the usable memory in hand.

Pros: Premium quality design.
Feels good in hand.
Corning Gorilla Glass 5.
Type C port.
Fast charging.
Dedicated Memory Card slot expandable upto 512 GB.
Super Class Audio Speakers. Sound is very good. Listening music is very much enjoyable.
Not heating up while charging.
Display not bad at all.

All in all a good phone at this price range.",3
"Pros- good for laptop un interrupted connectivity.
Cons - this I noticed after approx 1 month of usage. once in a while (1 week approx) , I have to reset power of this backup to work smoothly.
Wifi calling drops frequently on phone, without using this backup, I hadn't happened before.
Verdict - I find it ok for laptop uninterrupted internet connectivity while working from home and while you are on important discussion.",3
Bluetooth connectivity range is very less. You need to struggle to connect Bluetooth.,3
"There are many bugs in app
Sleeping tracker is not working in app
Not getting notifications many times",3
Camera quality is poorer,3
Not very extra ordinary..!! But good to use..!!,3
"The watch worked perfectly fine for 3 days and now it only shows 1 sports mode. Tried all the troubleshooting steps. Had to get a replacement issued.
Apart from this the watch is perfect.",3
If you‚Äôre looking For voice calls do not buy very bad quality spend more and buy one plus Z,3
"Almost all features are good, but call volume is very low, this is really necessary, hope samsung will fix this in next upcoming versions.",3
"Phone is good..
Only problem is with Touch ,
Left side touch not working properly..
Replaced with new one.. but still same issue..
Never expected this",3
Only sleep tracking is good. Step count is kuch bhi... Even step count increase tonight when you sleep. Yoga is not tracking in my case. Show only light activity in the chart when I do yoga.,3
"I'm return this product.
I'm got a defective product.
When i install battery. It's got very hit. that why I'm returned it. But camera is ok best for beginners
And it's picture quality is very good.",3
Good product but basal too thick as compare to other watches. Font small not able to read easly.,3
Aux cable and Remote control is missing in the packet. What to do,3
Doesnt have a strong enough signal when compared to my single antennae dlink 150mbps wifi modem router. I had bought this to extend the range but sadly this wasnt upto the mark at all. So trying to return it is proving to be a nightmare even after asking to do so within the return period. 45days later Amazon still trying to pick up after numerous calls and chats with their call centre.,3
WiFi coverage is average. My old Belkin 150N router used to give better coverage under similar circumstances and position. I am not able to get more than 45mbps with 5ms ping.On my old router I used to get 50mbps with 2ms ping.,3
"Screen is very small. But handy product.
Two problems are - battery drainage very fast and becomes extremely hot after 15 minutes for just normal use like WhatsApp chat, facebook.
Don't suggest to buy.",3
Phone is nice for normal users. Battery life is good and phone is smooth to operate. But camera quality is not upto mark.,3
"Look & performance wise good, even camera also good but only problem is that company not provide fast charging.. it is take 3.5 hours to charge battery form 30 % to 100%..",3
Price is too high,3
"ok but not good..... bad quality of plasitc,,,,",3
"I can sense some fault on my product. on the right side verge of my product that is the adjustment area, I found the product lost its grib which is very important part in it. so I would like to replace this product asap.",3
"Product is good, very good price but ink costs you almost 1/3rd of the product cost. Not recommended for long term use, very good for events, small events, short term use.",3
Disappointed,3
Paper alignment section is not working proper,3
one of the best monitor i used ever ...,3
"I liked:
1. Looks
2. Display
3. Battery life
4. Sleep tracking is very good

I disliked:
1. I chose this over many because of the oximeter function it has. But I am disappointed. No continuous monitoring of SPO2, unlike normal pulse oxymeter.
2. Watch faces are useless. Only the default face is good.
3. Wrist tile function is very laggy. For checking the time, I have to twist my wrist multiple times or have to press the button.
4. App not that user-friendly. Many times, it gets unpaired. And sometimes it is difficult to re-pair them.",3
"Sent catc5e patch cable , not cat6.",3
No live visions,3
Sound is good but there is considerable video lag (latency). There are also problems with Bluetooth connectivity when switching between devices. It is ok if you are only listening to music on the phone but definitely not recommended for watching videos or movies. I returned it immediately due to these reasons.,3
"I am using it to track my steps,looks good .but it's very light in weight.",3
I got the product which sound quality is very low... really i m very unhappy.... i dont know whether it is defect or not... its my personal experience,3
Product is not good and it's got damage in 2 months not have Clare sound while talking not get disconnect call after pressing mic button. Every time need to place the mic next to your mouth so that other person can hear your voice properly.,3
"Battery üîã backup is not so good. If you activate all functions, it will last maximum 7days. All the activities are not recorded automatically. If you have to activate it before activity.",3
Average quality. Speed is very slow despite very less apps installed. Just okay to receive calls,3
"Earphones on one side stopped working after 5 months of use. Then I had them replaced after speaking to JBL customer service, since there is one year warranty. The replaced ones have also stopped working on one side now after 1 month use.",3
please provide driver cd for printer,3
I slept say 3 pm to 10 pm and it records only 3 pm to 5 pm. Most day time sleep gets cut off as short naps of maximum 2 to 3 hrs. The whole purpose to buy this watch was defeated for me as I own AmazeFitBip already. Don't understand y the sleep tracking needs to force a person to sleep at night,3
I like display,3
Battery backup is less than they claiming,3
The acoustics of this headset were sub par. The build quality is good.,3
"Shipping was super delayed.
Also the splitter inside wasn't working, I used the ood one I had",3
"good one, good for the price",3
Bluetooth range is less product delivered in very bad condition satellite speaker was open like second hand product I had to fix it but adhesive,3
Would like to return this product and need a booster not a router. Request ur help in this regard.,3
Purchased it for regular use. Its an average quality product. Good buy if you get it around price around Rs 300.,3
I have one copen my have cash back.I called cusTomer care u are cust mer tolled  I want u ditkzgm,3
awesome value for money,3
Mobile Phone too heating,3
"The wifi range is lesser than my 2 antena ZTE Wifi router which I got it for free with My ISP. I don‚Äôt understand what is the use of 4 external antennas and one internal , may be just for show. If you want to upgrade for range this is not at all a good option.
The 5G band is the only upgrade I got, but the range is so bad for 5G . Just inside the room.
If you have an Internet connection with more than 50 mbps then only 5G band is of any use.
Amazon delivery packing and everything was very good.",3
Value for money ! Sound Quality is better the boat and sony.,3
"Strap has torn apart. I wonder that MI have made it like that, so customer can bough new straps. i having huawei band has well. But Strap is working good till now. which i bought 2 1/2 Years back.",3
"Gettting low speed in wifi,but in LAN cable its fine",3
Print quality is good but the cartridge performace is so poor. Just print 75 paper and cartridge empty.,3
"After a year, i am writing this review. i have no words to say about Bluetooth connectivity. bluetooth connectivity with phone is not fast, not quick, when i connect this headphone with my phone, first three times it automatically disconnects and then it connects. battery backup is OK, considering the prize point but audio quality is not that promising, No bass, no treble, just regular audio like old Nokia BH-503 Bluetooth Headphones. it gives 5-6 hours of continuous battery backup but volume is not high. call quality is ok. That's what i wanted to say about this product.
i bought this for my wife. she said where did you find this pretty junk?",3
Good option to go for!!,3
"Very bad camera, battery backup is good.
No 5Ghz wifi available.",3
The quality of the product is not good at the hinges and getting ear pain if we use for longtime.,3
Good but catrideges finish fast,3
"using these earphones from last one month....clear n crispyüëçüëåsound delivered....but problem is only with button on microphoneüëé. It delays 2-4 second(sometimes more) for answering call, playing next track of music n pausing the same and no control for playing previous track as said....üëén we can't expect better build quality from JBL in this price range",3
There is no headset is with the mobile.,3
It is quite good.give satisfactory result in the budget.,3
"I have purchased it yesterday. Screen resolution, touch screen sensitivity, look, Other function accuracy is good. Battery can last upto 5-7 days as per literature. As automatic stress monitoring and real time heart rate monitoring , SPO2 monitor is manual. Actually there should option for automatic periodic measurement. It will more useful. Also temperature and Blood pressure measurement option is not included which are available in same range smart watch.",3
"Sleep tracking ok, battery bqckup not good only 3 days bqckup.",3
"overall it is a good product. but its been only 7 month the product mic got spoiled, its not audible to the second party. but I can listen to music. however right ear is again got spoiled. now only one side can be used for listening music, but cant hear anything on call or while talking to the second party",3
Good products at affordable price,3
Good speed at near range. But worst when you have on other floor. Not good in range coverage. Support dual band that works good and smart switch work smoothly. Then need to work on signal strength as coverage not good.,3
Good printer,3
Bass is less.i didn't expect this from Sony.,3
Average pair of headphones,3
"Battery life and display is very good ... Other than this everything is not so accurate ..
And the worse part is the stape tracking....",3
Sound skips while running. Never happened in boat 400 which was cheaper,3
Gets slow sometimes. Gets heated up after 12 hours of continues usage. Signal coverage is not too notch,3
"Product is good bus . if you give more bass in product so it is golden product to anyone..
Otherwise this product is very good in low price.",3
Accuracy is not ok,3
Device has pairing issue with app. OEM should work on it.,3
WhatsApp notifications not working. Only normal msg work. Other msg notifications not working. Disappointing.,3
The product was good and has a good range. I was able to get one point wifi in my third bedroom. It lasted only two years. It was hardly used and only my mobile was connected to it regularly. It goes well with Airtel service provider.,3
The Ethernet port what should be given with this router is missing. The Yellow coloured patch cord is missing from the box. I have faced problems of buying the Ethernet port from outside. I paid Rs.100/- extra for this.,3
Ink consumption is way too high! Won't recommend.,3
"Battery life very worst, because im using only Feb 15 to Feb 21 only charge going to 8 percent, company is telling 10 days battery life, totally upset, and one more step counts and calories burn calculations are little wrong.",3
Whenever print it is making to noise,3
Good mobile phone,3
"Although the build quality and design are great..but , unfortunately the sound quality is bad! and I mean it..I have jbl and skullcandy headsets of the same price range and their sound quality is just at another level as compared to this one.. won't recommend at all..",3
good product but not with bass quality as claimed,3
"I think its second quality.i'm not satisfied,sorry",3
Wearing this head phone long time it pressuring the ears so my ears are pained and sweating,3
Touch screen not working after 6 month,3
"This was a gr8 wired earphone but i did not knew that it would not even last 1 year..
You cannot claim its warranty easily and why will you even waste your time on such a cheap price product...i would prefer Go for JBL if ur budget can be extended by little more otherwise it is overall average...i m very disappointed by Boat and i m only giving 3 stars bcoz of its sound quality nad one more thing it is not durable and one of its side (left) is not working now...",3
First I received a used one. Upon exchange I got another one which looks new but the backup is very poor. Use it for 30 min and you get a low battery alert. Not happy.,3
Has no bass control nor is its bass that great. FM did not work for me as the speakees were kept 10 feet inside the room from window.,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Purchased it on 1st October 2020. Got delivered very next day.

In the box you get a magnetic charging extension and the band with few reading materials.

Everyone knows the pros but I would like to clarify the main con here.

Mi band didn‚Äôt try to improve from past 4 generations. The step tracking is pretty inaccurate. I traveled through my bike and it calculated 2500 steps. I thought Mi would do something of the step counter. However it is pretty inaccurate.

Rest all is very good.

So if your sole purpose is step counting then you will be disappointed.",3
This is ok headphone for the given price. Don't expect high quality for this price range. I feel volume is too low for the headphone as I always need to keep my computer or mobile volume at high to hear anything properly.,3
Boat Rockers 400 is much better than boat rockerz 450 in sound quality,3
"The item is not as expected, range is low hardly covering 800-900 Sqft. poor signal",3
"My head set stopped working after a 5 monthsÔºå
Jan month i bought this headset and its working well up to may month then one ear phones are not working , june month totally spoiled and finally tended to me fed up

Kindly refund ear phones",3
"The app is glitchy, it doesn't connect to Google Fit properly so you can't track your health in any third part apps like Fitso or Nike Training app. This was why I had wanted a band in thw first place so for me it's pretty useless. It tracks your heart rate, sleep and steps alright but if you can't really use that data how you want to, what's the point?",3
Ink gets dry problem,3
"I was hoping that this routers range would extend far beyond my 10 year old belkin router that I was using, but that is not the case. In an open area this router has a good range but when it has to pass through walls the range is same as my old belkin router. If there is only 1 wall to pass through, the router is able to accomplish that but if it has to pass through 2 walls in case of multiple rooms then the network strength is very low.

Pros:
The router provides good download and upload speeds. No complaints there.
Looks good and is compact and lightweight.

Ethernet Cable and power adapter are included. Set up is easy.",3
"It was a good product i was really happy
It has good futures it emwas good for working and it is also good for online ne classes",3
"Charging doesnt work .
Charging doc is loose. Need a rubber band (see attached pic) to get it charged.",3
Overall good product,3
"Putting display part on charging dock is a real headache.. it doesn't fit on charging dock.. every time i try to put, it just pop up..",3
"Certainly great looking with the rgb but not at all comfortable...Seriously dont buy it (LargeHeads), u'll get bored with the rgb after a wk or 2 but for long duration usage [> 1 hour] its not reliable. Go with the cheaper i-ball or simply buy a comfortble headphone and plug in a F--->2 M AUX adapter for PC users.
Average sound and Not a PRACTICAL headset.....precisely not good for gaming either.",3
Good but a used product delivered.RAM works well with laptop but it appears to be used one and not new one. Didnt come in company package. Still does the job what I purchased it for.,3
It's good but price is high according to this product,3
The range is very poor .. It is not even covering 2BHK room and also the the led that are given in the router has very low brightness and you cant get to know if lights are on,3
"No bass, no surround sound, no stereo sound not good for gaming, buy it at your own risk thank you",3
"Headphone is no doubt good, but it stopped working after 1 year 4 months of usage. What can i find is that the jack is not working properly and left side can't release any sound from it. I bought 2 at a time, both of them have the same issues. Really disappointed and please anyone let me know if they can repair it.",3
Not recommended for calling purpose.I bought it for calling but person on other side was not able to hear anything as mic is not good.,3
Watch is all okay.. No issues till now.. but the app for this watch which is Noisefit app is just worst.. it was good only for 2-3 days then it started creating problem.. my watch record my every activity but it didn't showed up in the app so many times. I do workout daily in 4 sessions so i want proper record and sometimes it doesn't show 2 or 3 sessions and some i lost the whole day activity.. i complained about that to the app costumer service on whatsapp. So they came up with a temporary solution that is uninstall the app and reinstall. And when i did so in the middle of the day i lost all the data.. from app and watch too..,3
"Ok for a relatively cheap pair.
Nothing great, but not horrible either",3
"GOOD FOR REGULAR USAGE.
CANNOT PLAY HEAVY GAMES ON THIS DEVICE",3
Office Working,3
You can see ......while you not walk but shake your hands it can show your steps.....false step reading by this watch...no gps...mi simply fool you...while global version have gps n all.....,3
"After reading the review that it will work on first floor if I placed it in ground floor
But no its not working well I only get a single point and that's not expected",3
Although product was fine. But when it comes to warranty support it's pathetic.,3
Not very good range. Ok Ok to use. Currently using with Airtel ADSL Modem.,3
The headphone was used with care bought as on 4th june and 15 days back one side of the ear piece stopped functioning .. Can something be done about it,3
"Amazon does not have a mobile headset in their product details. The quality of the camera is very poor and the product is priced at Rs 10,990. It is mobile for that. Amazon product details need to be updated.",3
"No noise cancellation
Not comfortable",3
This is only useful with bsnl internet connection.,3
"I am writing this review after using this band for almost a year.
PROS:-
1. The sleep tracking is really good and with the help of the mi app you can also see the ranking and quality of your sleep in comparison with th other band users all around the world.
2. Quite light weight, you will not even feel that something is wrapped around your wrist.
3. Water proof, can easily handle a splash of water.
4. Durable. By mistake I have dropped it twice from the height of almost 5 feet and nothing happened.
5. You can control the song playlist via this band.(For this you need to keep the app installed)
6. The heart beat tracker and calories burnt through out the day is pretty accurate. It also has various exercise modes and recent update even included swimming.
7. The battery lasts for almost 3 weeks and charging takes 50 minutes.

CONS:-
1. The strap, which comes along with the device is quite delicate and short lived. It started to break into pieces and left the band of no use. I had to order the strap again separately.
2. The charging dock also has a very delicate, thin and short wire. After few uses, the device does not fit into the charging dock and keeps on bouncing. I had to put some weight on the device while charging so that it remains at its place.

Apart from these, I didn't find any other issue. I would recommend it!",3
Camera Quality is not as aspacted. or some time lag problem are created,3
Camera quality is poor.,3
"Looking vry odd, head band is vry big size, & Bluetooth connection automatically disconnect after few minute of playing song.",3
JUST OK,3
"Not recommend, for music listeners.",3
"The phone is well built and works well. However, it comes loaded with ""bloatware"" which may not be worth the Rs. 500 or so saving compared to other phones. Not easy to remove the bloatware!",3
Good for home usase.,3
Overall its a good product in this price range and boat is ensuring the equality of product eventhough its upto jbl or sony which have a much higher price.,3
"It's worth buying, but it's over ear headphone, so make sure you are using it for a short time(< 1 hr) orelse you will feel pain, primary otalgia on your heart. Sounds are clear and crisp.",3
Ok ok,3
"Ok type phone but in same cost you may get good deal in samsung now.
No fingerprint reader,camera is ok ok",3
Very good performance,3
Print cost high,3
Display touch problem,3
Product is good but would have appreciated if wired headphones were a part of the box. Quite disappointing.,3
The jack is very fragile. It has started to crack in less than 5 months and now one of the earphones is barely giving sound output.,3
Good one. Go for it. But sound of creative is better than this.,3
"Good but not at price
Flexible , design and
Battery awesome
Don't buy modifying review after 9montha
This is darriable instruction of paring come frequent after it is connected no much buitl quality it was broken my me too",3
Nice product to buy,3
Km duri pe bat krne m bhi problem deta h,3
Very good design. looks awesome. but product detailed did not mentioned that it works only for static IP. i have broadband which has dynamic IP. SO I am unable to use this router. The second most annoying thing is that this product cannot be returned. It can be replaced that too with the same product and model.,3
"Audio quality is great but build quality is very bad
It broke after just 1 month of usage",3
I am using this past 3 months. But signal is weak.,3
"The strap broke within 3 months of use.
The sleep traking is bad. Shows sleeping even when awake & vice versa.
Step count is overstated",3

Not good waste watch plzz don't purchase,3
"Average quality, Bluetooth v5.0 is good but no vibration motor!",3
Battery is draining like anything and too rapidly. 6% loss in 5 hours this is not acceptable. This drainage of battery is observed after turning off all the features of band even the raise wrist wake feature there is something fishy with these bands. Many users around me have been reporting the same problem throughout.,3
Material (Plastic) used is very poor quality..,3
The earphones are great but the mic stopped working after some usage.It has a one year warranty.I don't know if there is return policy.,3
Offcourse the sound quality is very good but not great . quality of material used is complete plastic not that much great and also wires are round not flat so it gets tangled sometime.,3
It is ok . Not better. Unhappy only chalao system .,3
"Print quality and print speed is not good
I am not satisfied with this printer",3
I have a 100MBPS connection.. but the speed on the router is not that great. Also.. the onboarding and set-up process can be improved and made more user friendly.,3
"So o bought this router an year ago from Amazon . The process of installation was very easy and setting it up from TP-Link UI was very easy as it is automatic and there is lot of information available .
The signal strength is also really good and i could use internet from every corner of my small 2BHK flat without any kind of speed or wifi strength issue .

Now , 1 year later
It's an absolute mess and i can barely even send a whatsapp message from my bedroom . On running the speed test the download and upload speed barely reaches 1mb/s even though my speed is 100MB/s up and down . On running the speed test in my study room the speed is 92mb/s but when i go to my bedroom i can barely send a whatsapp message. The speed is highly unstable for some reason and it is pretty annoying at this point and I'm considering switching to D-Link or Nethgear .",3
Sound clarity is good but there's no bass. Ear pads are also not much comfortable so I suggest you all to go for Jbl c300si or t250si both are same. I have t250si and it is lot better than this sony product. Bass is much more and padding is good too.,3
"Product is good. For tikona,ACT users they should switch on tikona adapter and dlink router . Router link with tikona adapter. It is wireless without modem.
Packaging is worst. I ll give 0 star becoz cloudtail simply fold the single paper. Amazon is always good in packaging but this type of packaging means amazon will reduce the values.",3
Camera getting poor day by day.. it was not clear.,3
"It is good if you regular buds user . But it‚Äôs hurt your ear which is not good for your ears. U can not put it in your for long time . Even 5-10mints. The main thing it falls out from your ear regularly which is very awkward ü§®. I don‚Äôt think soo it has noise canceling feature too it‚Äôs not working good.
The bass quality is awesome . Appreciated for that.",3
Worst mobile when iam using more than 1hour phone temperature will be highly increased and hanging also.No one is responding,3
Good product.. I have ordered 15 days before.. worth for price..,3
Don't buy this product the sound is a bit sharp which irritates your ears put few hundreds more and better buy a nice one.,3
bass was very low but sound is ok,3
Not like,3

Made of plastic, quality is not so good
However headphones are very soft to ears",3
It's OK,3
Printing quality poor,3
"Its doesn't have Gigabit ports so it can support uptown 100 Mbps only, I'm having 150 Mbps connection so its waste of money for me.

5 Ghz band range is very less,
If you want to upgrade this is a BAD choice.",3
"Sleep tracker sucks.

After 5 months the battery has started draining out. It last for 5 days only even after activity minimum features.",3
"With 6gb RAM expected high performance, rather there is too much of lag which is really frustrating",3
"It was supposed to be made in India as there is written over there i.e. manufacturing : india.

But i got this made in china. Why? Someone in comment box has the same problem as mine. I think they do it deliberately.

If i talk about the earohone, build quality 4.4/5
Sound quality 3.5/5
Base 4.2/5
I got it for 600INR",3
bass incre. decr. not avilable and bass is not comfortable,3
Product was expected good but the thing what I found awful were cartages . In year warrnty so bad cartages were installed in it,3
"I have bought before only one boat product, it is boat rockers 400 Bluetooth headphone. It is very high quality sound device. I have expected the headphone will be like that, but sound is not good as compared. Samsung headphone has better quality than this, only plus point is 1 year warranty in this budget. It has also mic that works good.",3
Router sent was not the same as shown. It looks like a local made product.,3
Good product ... havent used extensively but useful at home for childrens project,3
This product battery life is too gud overall this product is cool,3
Nice watch but need some software improvement. Spo2 and bp should be calculated automatically not manually. App UI can be upgraded.,3
Wireless connection is not work properly.,3
Very poor coverage of the signal. Can't even cover the 2bhk flat.,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Still I m not using fiber network",3

These are not as good as the white ones. Somehow I feel the material quality is not that great. Sound is fine.,3
Bp is not so accurate,3
This product good but signal range is week,3
"Actual prodect design is different than product image shown in images.
Why design is different than shown in product description?
Signal strength is very poor even in 1BHK flat around 450 sq ft.",3
Data not accuracy...,3
"Not worth spending on 5GHz Dual Band Router if you expect 5GHz over a two stories building. I hoped that the 5GH would travel atleast two floors but it works only when sitting very close proximity to it.

I would have not ordered this one had I known that the 5GHz is not strong over a distance. Would have stick to my 2.5GHz N Router.",3
"The product physically feels good, but the sound quality especially the bass is not upto par with others especially at this price range. After using Sennheiser CX 180 I feel that had better bass than this. Also the packaging was pretty flimsy.",3
"Expected more speed in operation , but disappointed",3
"One Key not working..Sound quality is too bad
Budget monitor..",3

The FPS of camera could have been better.
Battery and fingerprint are amazing.
Bulky phone.",3
"unlike n4 routers it does not have ""wlan"" and ""wan"" light.. there's only one light in the middle. I should have spend extra 100 rupee for n4 but it fine now",3
"Like : Camera and songs can control from watch. Alarm works fine. Breating activity is superb.Can set our image from galary on main screen. Can also connect to Strava.

Dislike : GPS traking totally wrong. Staps counting wrong Sometimes count 1Km 400 steps and sometimes it approx.1000steps.
Sp O2 not working , Stress monitoring also not working. I have doubt in heart reading. Sleep monitoring calculation totally wrong ; Showing correct data sleep time and wake up time but simple maths calculation wrong ,like sleep time 11 pm and wake up time 7 am its showing 5 hours sleeping time instead of 8 hrs.",3
Printing quality should be better..,3
Sound not clear.. Rough sound clear,3
"If you are looking for an average smartwatch then noise colourfit Pro 2 is a good option . You get a lots of option like heart rate monitoring which is not that accurate and upto the expectations but not at all bad in the price you pay for watch , 24*7 activity tracking via dedicated app is a plus here but then come on not a fancy at all , sports mode check , fitness tracking check , sleep monitoring check , screen is a little less touch sensitive which is a minus , i have used the watch for more than two months now and yes all i can write is a good watch , battery life is üëç , like i literally go like a week on full charge with a heavy usage , so yes a good watch in overall . Is overpriced üëé",3
"Poor build quality. The plastic itself is alright but the headphone as a whole is not sturdy.
ANC is acceptable when playing audio. Cannot be compared to the high end Sonys and Bose units, but it's alright for 50% of the price.

Sound quality - typical V shaped tuning with rolled off highs, nothing special about it.

The provided 3.5-3.5mm cable is the worst thing in the box, absolutely pathetic - makes me suspicious if I received a fake unit.

Overall, it's alright. I just expected a bit more for 8k",3

Pl help.",3
"No complain with the band, but the procedure of charging is very problematic! Mi should do something about the charger, there is no way one can comfortably charge the band! The charging holder which comes with the band is a mess, whenever I try to charge the band by putting it in the holder it springs out from that.",3
Perfect working up to 100 Mbps,3

Wifi signal is weak.,3
Don't know about sleep tracking...i didn't wore during sleeping. It is a nice watch with good feature and appearance but it doesn't work under water...so not good while swimming,3
"It is a good watch in quality basis. But consists of only some basic features. It does not have camera, can't make calls or write messages, no sim or card slot etc. touch screen sensor is also average. I felt like it is little lagging too.
But it is easy and comfort to wear. Looks like a premium watch. If you have only few requirements then you can select this watch.",3
life of inks of cardridge if we dont not use long time,3
Poor signal strength just across room.,3
"I liked the battery backup and the design style of it, nice device, light weight, comfortable straps and other functions are also good, but the only cons in this watch is its screen , it is too small and very vulnerable. It gets scratches very easily, even on cleaning the screen for the first time with pure cotton cloth and very lightly, it got scratches . You must be very protective regarding its display to protect it from marks and scratches.",3
"Same signal strength as dual antena.
Not what i expected.
Good product but with dual antena signal strength. Sometime router off automatically.",3
Not like bass,3
"I really enjoyed this earphone. This is a very flimsy one, so if you are a person who would keep this one little organized in the bag and not to actually dump the earphone and then pull it out, this can last you long. It comes with additional earbuds which can be useful.

Sound quality is good for what you are paying and I really enjoyed listening to music and watch shows with this. The microphones are very good if you are not in a very noisy environment because the noise cancellation in this is bad. Even the sound from far away can be heard by the person on the other end.

Sadly this one won't last longer than a year. I had ordered two units and both of them had issues after 13-14 months. With one unit it was one earpiece stopped working and with the second unit, it had some internal damage in the wire due to which there was loose connection leading to loss of sound on the one earpiece.",3
"I had earlier my 24 inch HP LP2475w monitor. After ordering this 27 inch Benq monitor I thought it is a upgrade to my old monitor. But the pixels are so big that it can be easily seen. This was really downgrade for me. I am unsatisfied. My old 24 inch LCD monitor pixels was better.

The built quality is very very good compared to my another 22inch led dell monitor which you can see back of this monitor image. It is quiet heavy too. Speakers are normal, not loud.
It is good for students. Not so good for designers, small text editors and photoshop editors.

So guys please decide if you want to upgrade to 27 inch, think of at least 2k resolution.

Thanks for reading.
Hope it helps you to buy what you want,,,

With in one week mobile software problem then we bring it to mi service center they serviced mobile till now no problem in mobile,3
Will not talk about packaging as it always been good at Amazon. The sound quality of the headphone is good and it is very much dependent on your music app's equalisers. Battery backup is awesome. The controls are at the position which is tough to operate.,3
Screen size is small and touch is not working properly,3
"The smart watch is not that great for this price. Touch is not that good. Look wise it's very good. Call notification didn't work even after application setting in phone. So had to replace but that also not working properly ,sometimes I am getting call notification and sometimes not",3
"over all just good.. not like wow it likes that price .
all function are good.. bt
price is high and not useful high purpose like its price ... just shown time.. some messages display nd call vibrate... nothing do much more",3
Sound quality is excellent. But the build quality is not that good. The wire near one of the ear pieces broke. The outer covering. So its still working,3
Price worthy,3
Expected to be better. Users can go for it's updated version. It costs just few bucks more.,3
"If the watch shuts down, all of your previous data is lost.",3
"Average router ,works fine with all broadband and is very easy to setup",3
I gifted this phone to my father. Review after 40 days good phone in this price. Good battery backup. Camera quality is average & little bit slow.,3
Using for the last 8 months. Mic is sub standard as people are not able to listen voice over calls. Apart from that all good.,3
"Bass sound is low, speakers are not correctly working",3
"Everything is good about sound but about quality is not that good ,,
1.i used for not more then 6 month ,
2.its sliders broken aftersome month , 3.speaker's cushion getting out from the speakers ,
4.charging jack is not working properly..
For built quality i will not suggest you to buy it ...
And they are not accepting warranty for it also... Even after its slider got broken while putting out from the ear softly üò†",3
Sound good.Sound quality is like local made earphones not worth full brand to buy,3
Best headphones for bass...I liked it but the packaging was some kind of open.It is not properly packed..I thought that it is opened but it is sealed from inside... Although the product is very good,3
"Works well with stats but friends feature doesn‚Äôt work, nudges don‚Äôt work . Rest work ok. Waiting for app update",3
"Not as expected, the voice While calling is not good, no finger print.",3
Just ok for a wrist band. Everything is not that accurate. Band doesn‚Äôt sync wit app most of the times. Heart rate and sleep monitor shows very approximate values. Never shows any naps i take in between the day. Sometimes notifications come in chinese. Pros: Excellent battery life since its been only 3 weeks of usage nd gud it comes with magnetic charging.,3
Most ordinary watch,3
Received defective adapter not even charging 1%.. Phone is absolutely fine later went to mi care centre to get new adapter.,3
Sound quality and bass quality is good but sound is coming out of the headphones,3
Watch is looking great... Call function working properly but WhatsApp and message notifications are not working properly... Am not getting any message notifications...,3
Bearable,3
5 Ghz Range is not upto the mark.,3
"Well I may not be the right person to review any monitor however I can say that price of the product remains high most of time. Just because it has got the Free-Sync and support for VESA it does not necessarily have to be costly. The LCD panel looks similar to Dell s2216h and in no way it differ from it. The same Panel with 3H coating on it offering a year warranty on it.. Whereas in Dell they provide you with 3 years of warranty as well speakers beneath the monitor.
Not just I am complaining about it. I definitely do not recommend something this is priced higher than its specs. Take my words, and see by yourself. I have made several purchases from amazon including the Dell s2216h but I truly understand the concept behind the panel type, and back lit now.",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The functionality could have been better by the way of giving sound alerts for alarms/BP/HR/SpO2 levels which will continuosly monitor these parameters and give a sound alert if the levels drop by a set threshold. Also, the watch quick access functions(by swiping Left/right)from Home screen could be made customisable. Also, there is an issue connecting the Da Fit App to Google Fit on Android 11 using OnePlus Nord. Don't know about other configurations though.",3
Audio quality is good not best normally used for calling battery backup is mentioned on box is 6 hours but it's less than 6 hours.,3
best off sony,3
Nice üëå,3
Camera no clear,3
No finger print reader. Also camera quality is very poor. Poor performance and battery backup is low.,3
"You can't hear it more than ¬Ωan hour ears will pain like anything.
Sound it fine.
While on call it has a lot of disturbance.",3
The speaker volume is very low.,3
"Good smartphone it has good battery backup . this device with 2 gb ram is not better for gaming ,if it has 3gb ram it will gives average gaming perfomance. 3gb variant better than 2gb ram .so if you guys want better performance please take the 3 gb ram variant.because the 2 gb ram variant has lag and frame drops while playing games like free fire, pubg etc.so I would prefer the redmi 8 a dual 3 gb ram variant",3
sleep tracking report is bad and is not correct as it is based on hand movement and not on heart rate.Mobile App and coach are very good. Shows less steps in walk mode by 5%,3
Delike,3
"The ink is getting over very often just for 20 papers after reffilling,from last 3 week the print is not good ,the whole paper is black,we don't know what the problem is..this is the main drawback of this product",3
good purchase & helpful for small bussiness people,3
Excellent for me,3
honestly you buy it for the rgb thing and not for the sound.its awfully quiet for what it is but at this price point something like this is a steal,3
"Takes aprox 2 minutes to start.

Signal strength is not so good.
Previously i was using tenda simple router. I did nlt see much difference as i am using 40mbps plan only.

However, it is gud for upgrade only for future. You can connect more users lnly that is a advantage.

However if you want a big area you should go for mesh routers",3
Blietooth issue,3
The gadget appears to be a good one.,3
100+printes the ink is very low,3
I wouldn't find women health track on this band,3
"Received my product yesterday. Looks amazing at first instance. However, I faced bit difficulty in signing and pairing it. It took me almost an hour and go through different videos for assistance to finally make it through. I wish will have better experience with the features offered by the band. Took a snap of watch faces offered by mi, happy to see so much option.",3
It's easy to install and use. The printing ink finishes up faster than expected.,3
Product is great but didn't get Ethernet cable in box. I didn't expect that it will be missing,3
"If you purchase any branded products then you have some expectations with the brand .
However its not last longer .
After 6 months
Its jack giving me problems.
I have chosen the boat earlier And even after 6 months
It‚Äôs Bluetooth stopped working .
Not reliable.",3
It Can Cover 4-6 room medium size and 1big hall used for 1bhk flat,3
Overall good phone in middle range everything is good but camera quality not good I will given 3 out of 5,3
I am confused why the battery drains so fast! Can someone from Fossil team help me with this?,3
"Dear team
The headset broken from middle.request if I get a replacement",3

Print is not good for this price,3
"Not bad for general use but def can use more workout options like jogging, etc",3
"I purchased this mobile for my father, Mobile is good for normal users and aged people, if you want purchase go for 2g ram.

Cons

Slowness
Camera avg quality",3
All are normal after day use more understand,3
Printing speed is dead slow.,3
"yet to use it, hence unable to give an immediate review",3
This product is good. The clarity and storage capacity also better for 6800 rupees,3
I like this item,3
"That said, they are okaish. The sound quality is clean but the sound signature is trebble heavy. Like ear piercing sometimes. You might need to bump up ypur base via an equalizer, not to get better base, but to bring down the trebble for a balanced experience.",3
Battery life is so good at the time but cameraüì∑ quality too poor I am not satisfied .Speakerüîä sound slow down within two month.Please don't buy this device.,3
Basic time keeping is unpredictable. Has a flaw with synchronisation with app.,3

2. Dual Wifi .
3. Easy for setup .
4. Its comes with APP to configure and monitor who is connected to your wifi network .

"Money worth product
It is not for the music lovers has a low sound output
It has to be used at home purpose ,not to be taken out such a delicate product
Mic system not supporting
overall for the price its worthy..",3
"A big thank to Amazon for prompt delivery. Regarding the watch, after so many comparison I finally went for this. Initially, the watch worked fine, but then suddenly while I was working out, it got restarted automatically and wiped out all my workout data. Now, the touch screen when swiping from right to left is responding very poorly. The App function is very poor.",3
Mi give value for money this product is not worth it . Don't do mistake of buying this product,3
I would definitely recommend this product as value for money with best functionalities. However in 2018 faced one technical issue and got the router replaced as it was within the Warranty period. But I still satisfied with the service and it's usage.,3
super printer,3
"Found that when Power Cut frequently went to default mode automatically.
Within 1 months configure 2 times.",3
"This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked price

Mi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.

Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.

Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.
Need Improvement.

Processor is best for browsering , social networking
This processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.

Battery capacity is awesome ‚ô•Ô∏è no need to say.

brightness level is good and it also handle with sun.

Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses",3
Band is nice but band strap is too bad. I have used this watch for 2 months after that i lost it because of low quality stap it disappeared from my wrist. Stap quality and locking needs to be improved. I request don't buy mi band because strap is not safe on the wrist.,3

no much good.. ink consumption is high,3
"Pros:
This is futuristic phone with 5G option

Average headphone. There is no volume adjusting button. Always dust remaining in the buds. Bass quality is not good. It is just a headphone nothing special.,3
"This is not an excellent router, it comes under good router category, It takes approx 20secs to start and connect to internet and the coverage area is pretty bad, despite of having 2 and 5ghz bands. I live in a 1bhk room and Router i have is in my bedroom and the range cant get to Hallroom. I would suggest you to go with tenda. You will be able to easily get good range and it also comes with the gigabit port and every other feature this router comes with. So make a wise choice i would say go with tenda's ac10.",3
Does not last more than 7hrs,3

Excellent watch for the price. But the call notification is not working properly ( unable to cut / mute call notifications) in iphone XR . Complained to Amazfit but no response. I think they bothered only to sell not to rectify the customer problems.,3

Bed things:

1.charging adopter is very loose it's a fail design. It can not grab the device. Due to loose adopter you will find your smart watch uncharged after 8 hours of charging.

2 pulse accuracy not seems realiable.
3. Every time you need to remove your smart fit watch from strap.
4. Most of the time disconnects automatically to your smart phone.",3
"If you want a watch with a good design which feels good at hands then go for it.
Spo2 was near about the same or you can say more accurate. Got the same results in my oximeter.
Heart rate monitor was also upto the mark giving near approx readings.

Battery is ok but camera quality is not reached our expectation,3
Bad quality......instead fo for boat at this price boat gives nice quality.....,3
"The picture quality is very good. 5 stars.
The Audio is useless. 1 star for it.

ONE issue with the viewing is that the screen adjustments are mannual. During the day time Eye care intillegence work, but during the night we have to manually reduce the brightness and the contrast to avoid straining the eves. So this has to be done every day, it's not worth the price. 2 star for it
Over all 3 star",3
"Bluetooth range is less.
Need to update the software daily.
Battery lasts for 3 days maximum if we use the watch 24 hours.

Not recommended. Poor signal strength specially if you want WiFi coverage for 2 BHK flat.,3
Please don't buy any body this phone. Software issue. My phone is new only one month old. Two time I goes to service center. Again issue in software. This problem us not created only my phone. Issue in all Mi note 9 phone.,3
"So, I'll tell you how it is after 7 months,
We ordered one of these and The First one we got was bot working, Then we told them to replace that,And got my replacement immediately,It was all good and comfortable at the beginning,But now It charges so quickly like within an hour and The charge just holds for 1 day,Just 1 day,So I'd have to charge it every single day to use this,the charge did not last for 9 days as they mentioned,And also This is a very Bad choice If your a play games,Tye sound is delayed by 1 second and you can't hear some particular SFX sounds.

You may consider the following points before getting your Zeb thunder:

‚Ä¢The charge does not last for 9 Days,It lasts for 1-3 days.
‚Ä¢These are not recommended for gaming, The SFX is crappy after using this.
‚Ä¢These are very comfortable.
‚Ä¢The quality is pretty good,It hasn't worn or frayed yet.
‚Ä¢The jack provided jack is horrible,It doesn't work on neither my pc nor mobile.

~bonus tip for new headphone buyers~

‚Ä¢ prefer the headphones which has oval‚Å∞ earpiece(like zeb thunder),and not circle¬∞ earpiece Cause oval is more comfortable and you can wear those without pain for 4-5 hours.",3

No range,3

"ITEM SENT IN GOOD CONDITIONS. BASS and SOUND QUALITY NOT BAD ACCORDING TO PRICE RANGE ~ BUT PROBLEMS R IN SPECIFICATIONS !!
1. LED NOT TURNS BLUE AFTER FULL-CHARGE ~ AS MENTIONED IN MANUAL. SO IT‚Äôs A PROBLEM TO KNOW WHETHER ITS FULLY CHARGED OR NOT IN OFF MODE.
2. LED TOO TINY & TOO INDISTINCT & HARDLY VISIBLE DURING CHARGE !! KEEP UR ROOM LIGHT OFF & SEE WHETHER ITS BLUE OR RED !!
3. POWER RESUME OPTION SOMETIMES NOT WORKS ~ MEANS EVRYTIME IT STARTS FROM BEGINNING TO PLAY !!
4. MEMORY CARD DOES NOT START PLAY AUTOMATICALLY ~ AS MENTIONED IN MANUAL.
U HV TO PUSH PLAY BUTTON.
5. BUTTONS R VERY MUCH FLAT & INDISTINCT. U HV TO FIND IT LIKE A BLIND PERSON BY TOUCH. SO ITS ALWAYS CONFUSING. MOREOVER NEX & VOLUME BUTTONS R SAME. SO ITS MORE CONFUSING & LITTLE COMPLICATED !!
6. COLOUR LOOKING LIKE BRILLIANT RED OR DEEP ORANGE IN PICTURES. BUT ITS ACTUALLY PALE RED ~ WHICH I DISLIKE VERY MUCH. KIDS & CHILDISH FOLKS LIKE THIS COLOUR USUALLY.
A BRAND Or A COMPANY SHOULD B MORE CAREFUL OF ALL THIS THINGS.
IT SEEMS FUNCTIONERIES DEZINERS OF THIS BRAND OR COMPANY R NOT RICH-THOUGHT OR WELL-SENSITIVE. THEY R JUST MARKETING PEOPLE !!
7. THE RIGHT SIDE STRETCH-LOCK IS LITTLE LOOSE. IT ALWAYS COMES OUT 1 / 2 NOTCHES DURING LISTENING.

9. BLUETOOTH VERSION MENTIONED IN AMAZON ~ VERSION 5. WHERE MANUAL SAYS ~ ITS 4.2 !
WHATEVER IT IS ~ IT HAS 1 / 2 SECONDS DELAY IN VIDEO PLAY !! SO DELICATE PROBLEMs FOR GAMERS & MUSICIANS !!
10. AS BECAUSE BODY COLOR IS BLACK ~ ITS A PROBLEM TO FIND THE PORT & WHOLE DURING PLUG OR JACK IN !!

Not expected,3
"Battery is good. But performance is bad, this phone lags like hell",3
"Audio is good but it has got problems.
Ears would pain after a short use.
Not good for gaming. Well, all wireless headphones on this price range are not good for gaming.Going for a wired one is a better option.
Thankyou.",3
noise cancellation is not that good ... Bluetooth is awesome... You get an aus cable USB cable... And at last the real amazing thing gana subscription and book my show online subscription and 1 year warranty claiming card and and bolt play app membership... So at last with all these things it is overall amazing... The sound quality is really awesome... What i didn't like is that it can get broken... As it is foldable...,3
This phone takes ages to get charged and after 5 days charging cable stopped working which I can't replaced right now because of lockdown situation. I refer the phone with fast charging. This phone takes 2 to 3 hour for full charging.,3
not covering the area as we expected,3
"The look is good but the plastic feel is a let down and makes you realize that is a 10k product.

Sound quality is ok. If you are an audiophile, don't buy

Noise cancellation is weak and I had purchased the product for the noise cancellation which was a bit of a let down.

Overall, it is Sony so you can expect it to last and keep the performance consistent but if you are looking for sound and noise, go for Sennheiser.",3
Bit expensive for the performance.,3
"Products are good, screen size is ok, last night charged full after 12hours battery is 80%, hr, bp and spo2 is ok.",3
"Sab kuchh thik hai , BP is not Accurate, tamprature bahar SE BHI le Kar effect dalta hai, Red Strap Ka Pin same day me tut gya, Pin thoda ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§ú‡•ã‡§∞ ‡§π‡•à‡•§ Other is Good...Radhe Radhe üôèüôè",3

"MS Office was valid for 4 days only, seller has not mentioned complete details. It's cheating. Pls do not buy as it will waste if you purchase MS office of Rs 5K. Instead invest this 5k to buy more advanced version along with MS office access too.",3
"Intially when i bought this product, but less than a month, it stopped working. when i contacted customer care there is no response. Please don't buy this product. Waste of money",3
it's good but not best,3
"After using the earphones for a couple of weeks, I started getting itching in the ears and hence have stopped using it. The material used to cover the speakers might not be skin-friendly......its about over 2 weeks that I still have the itching...",3
Phone good,3
"I have a dislike here , others never complain regarding the charger quality. The charger quality/ design is totally outdated . The charger should be the one which can be used as USB cable for other devices like laptop, desktops, etc. This is not fair in these digital India. But its wothful with the price of just Rs.4,999/- almost Rs.5000/- .Today, the 12th Feb 2021 bought for my beloved.",3
The earphone was good at the initial phase but after just 5 months one side of it has detected. It would be great if this review reaches to the company and they could somehow take action to replace it.,3
"Good product,but not that much satisfied",3
The printing is so good and easy to use,3
Producect normal,3
Wifi signal disconnect automatically and we need to restart the router. Not sure why Amazon having this kind of product on app and say Amazon choice,3
Product is excellent. But the package alone is damaged.,3
"BoAt is starting to slack off, I remeber buying the rockers 400 and they were soo good for the price but now these headphones are just all marketing and no performance. To top it all off the left ear cup was not properly assembled and was making noises.",3
"I bought this camera in September 2016 and been using it for more than a year. Following are some useful points for those who are really interested in photography:

Pros:
1. Excellent battery life
2. Super fast focusing
3. Weather-sealed body gives you confidence to shoot during rains and wet conditions.
4. Great choice of lenses(any Canon camera would have this advantage)
5. Excellent from-camera JPEG images(which most Nikon users feel is a disadvantage for them and often prefer post-processing)
6. Good shutter speed
7. Amazing live-view for shooting and focusing( This is where it does better than Nikon cameras. Video mode has Dual-pixel CMOS technology for focusing. So gives you cinematic effect)
8. Touch-screen gives you better control during focusing if you are using Live-view(for both stills and videos) and also helps you to navigate through menus and images faster and review the images in a faster way
9. Kit lens has good zoom range of 18-135 mm (which most of the other same priced also provide)
10. Inclusion of time-lapse feature is boon for many enthusiasts and travel photographers
11. Full articulated screen has helped me many times during hand-held shots of macros, landscapes and portraits.

Cons:
1. Poor low-light performance compared to other same priced DSLRs
2. Kit lens zoom range is good but unlike other Canon cameras you don't get kit lens with zoom upto 250mm. This is a disadvantage for wildlife/bird photographers.
3. Dynamic range is poor. Lots of details lost when shooting images with bright highlights and dark shadows.Although camera has in-build HDR mode, the quality and sharpness of the image is very poor. My Nikon 5500 performs much better. It has good Dxo Mark rating for HDR
4. Image quality detirorates rapidly after ISO2500. This is where Nikon D5500 performs much better.
5. RAW Image quality is poor compared to my Nikon D5500 and lesser details

1. For first time DSLR buyers:
-Well I feel this is too expensive buy for first-time buyers. Most of the first time buyers often end up giving their interest in photography and their cameras soon end up in OLX or Quickr with hardly being used. So I suggest buying less expensive DSLRs or buying Nikon cameras if you dont need touch-screen and twivel-screen or don't shoot live-view.

2. For those who are upgrading:
There are two categories here. Upgrading since they already Canon Lens and those upgrading from beginner to enthusiasts without any preference of brand. For those upgrading from Canon and if you already have good canon lenses, this is the right option. For those who don't mind the brand, I would suggest Nikon D7200 but again if you are doing lot of video and using screen for shooting and want flexibility to review images like the way you do with your smartphones, this is good option",3
Prints less pages. Also cartridge is expensive,3
"The look and sound quality is awesome , but the jack does not get fitted to 3.5mm audio output port properly. This problem arose after 3 months use.",3
"If ypu have MI band 4 don't buy this and if you are purchasing any band first time then go for it.
~ Lookwise similar to Mi Band-4.
~ Screen size is little bit increased.
~ Some features increased.
~ Battery backup is bad.
~ One more upgrade charger is now magnetic, which is very good feature.",3
This is 2.1 and i need 5.1 so i return it,3
"I got this headset for 500 in offer.
The only problem is that there is tag on headset and on tag written is Made In China so I'm in doubt that its orignal or Copy.",3
Not so fast,3
"phone is good on that price but battery doesn't work as 3000 mah and camera quality not good, display over app features not available",3
Writing the product review after quite sometime of purchase and return so I guess it was the ease of use that made me to return.,3
"Good
Thanks Amazon",3
"Sound quality is good
But one side of this earphone stops working in only just 2 months after buying
Interior fault",3
Very poor quality plastic. Locks broke when back was opened the first time. Screws sheared out of surface when I tried to fit them back. All USB ports at one side make it uncomfortable to use sometimes.,3
it wase nice i try c6 it has 5ghz 48 channel & c6 has old Qualcomm Atheros QCA9563 & archer a6 is totally different it has latest newer Qualcomm QCA9886 chipset it has 5ghz 161mhz Chanel very stable product must buy i stream 4k 8k no issue 5ghz 161mhz channel in tplink archer ac80 but mobile use 5ghz only 866mbps not worth high mbps router i give 3 star because c6&a6 has no bandwidth control very bad qos,3
Worst thing is the headphones are very tight on ears which can cause severe pain to the ears...after use of 3 months it has been dead and no warranty or help is provided from the company,3
Everything is good but battery backup is just 8 hours. When 30% battery remaining blutooth Warne and disconnect. Battery life is very less in comprision of other,3
I have been using this product from last week. Let me tell you my experience about the headphone. Worth value for money. No noise cancellation but sound is little low compare to other headphone. battery backup is good it run around 6hrs once you charged. Thanks to Amazon to delivered the product at my doorstep with mentioned time.,3
Range is still a issue even after buying a 2 anteena router....,3
Its a good product but some times it gives some glitches it just ok not bad for money not good,3
"I have been using it for a month...
This product is too good and if we disconnect the internet connection then it continuosly record in SDcard and the picture quality is also good but the output speaker not so good ,there is an to much echo in output audio but it was an temporary,it was fixed by a update.
overall it was value for money at ‚Çπ2,199 thank for read this comment",3
"After having experienced the product I felt this is an overhyped product. the Dell monitor that I had before was much better than this.

Height Adjustment is the only added plus. Rest is OK. Not very great !",3
"Sound quality is good, but plastic used is very bad it as broken.",3
"I'm using since 2 months....
Absolutely value for money... I got it @1199 in Great Indian Festival during durga puja...
This is the best headphone you can buy in this price range specially for those who are bass lovers...
Noise cancellation is not good but not a deal breaker for me...
Only problem is that buttons are very flat or you can say you cannot identify the buttons... Sometimes I press the volume down button instead of power button...
And I'm giving 3 star because I received a defective one...",3
How to use bluetooth in this speaker system?,3
"This is good for normal use .camera quality is worst .
Camera bhout bekkar h . yellowish colour k photo ate h .",3
Seems good..spo2 and heart beat reading is fine but BP reading is not precise.,3
"It's been a month or so. The product looks good but not as useful as I assumed it would be. One has to remember to switch on the modes everytime like walking/running etc so it doesn't automatically track. Also the heart rate isn't very accurate. Overall the design is quite nice and works very basic. Don't seem to get call notifications for some reason.
The product developers can definitely work on the shortcomings so it's a seamless experience.",3
"Camera quality OK, battery life OK, best fingerprint reader",3
"Front camera very bad
Others all things are saisfactory.",3
"Sleep tracking and steps count is not accurate.need to fix this problem,fake steps count is showing,need to fix this issues.",3
Size of product is to big for any home,3
Ink is costly only 25 paper approx print in black and white,3
Bought on 7 July......nd now it's 29 August nd one earpiece is nt working,3
"Sound quality and durability is good, but customer care service is very Very Very POOR..They did not pick up the product for repairing within the WARRANTY PERIOD,even contacted repeated times....Brand like boat, i had never thought about this poor quality of services..",3
"Sound and bass quality is good, but noise cancellation is not that good. And if you use these almost every day, then cushion covers might get torn in an year or so, it depends on how you use it. But wire quality is great.",3
"While using headphones for talking on phone, people on other side of phone always complain of too much background noise.",3
The phoen looks great and design is good and the sporty orange is attractive .The main backdrop in the phone is camera . The camera clarity is very worst and battery life is good.,3
Its an average product to use compared to other phones,3
"I thought this would cover my entire house, but it could not pass my single wall. It is placed in one corner of my bedroom (and that could be the reason) but even from that point it does not transmit data with same speed beyond 15 feet in another room. Else, with LAN connected to computer, it is giving me great speed",3
"Step tracker is not so accurate. Was fine initially but now shows nearly 25-30% less
Good battery life. Almost goes on for 3-4 weeks with no heavy usage
Used while doing cycling n it keeps getting disconnected from app n needs to be restored every 2 - 3 mins.",3
it is good product.,3
Nice should be more better,3
Bass was not good as i expected....,3
Dislike fingerprint reader. It's given at the side (power button). Quite often difficult to read. Camera is okay types,3
Overall rating is average. üîã Battery Backup is good . But camera not good as expected,3
"After some months , the device cannot be used for normal calls",3
"Though overall it works ok, I don't find the range of this router good enough. I have a 7 year old single antenna Netgear N150 router half of this one's power and that has the same range as this.
The router IC got fried once and D-link fixed it within 10 mins, had to visit the service center. I also had network problems due to the router firmware and D-link support replied within 24 hrs. They even did a remote configuration once and there is also live chat available.
So you will get a bad product with good service, but what's the use if you can't use the product in a way you want to? The hardware is really crap in this router, better go for Netgear for expensive or TP-Link for cheaper solution.",3
"Sound is nice.
Buds are comfortable.
But Harman service is very poor. One of my earpiece was unresponsive after 5-6 months.
And still it is not replaced. Service personnel saying it'll take 1month to replace.",3
"Noise cancellation is not good, the sound is very low and poor quality, DO NOT BUY it, Go for earplugs",3
The product is good . Mobile colour is also good .,3
The product should have a return policy instead of only replace policy.,3
its an ok device,3
"Better smart watch for excise tracking the daily activity, but Mobile app to be more interactive and data porne....",3
"This band is a nice quality item. It falls back on accuracy. It even tracks heartbeat when the band is off and that's surprising. It even tracks steps when I am sleeping n I do not do sleep walking üò¥. Very unhappy with the results as it should have been good with accuracy considering it as a fitness band. Only the add on features are good like music control, camera shutter,weather updates etc.",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Pros:
Good : watch, accurate tracking, big and crisp clear display.

Cons: don't buy if you are buying it for oximeter, its pathetic and doesn't show accurate reading.",3
Would have been better if Blood pressure monitor included,3
I'm buying this product Nov 18 2020 & used 1 day there's not support to calling n then I was request to exchange the product I have this 21 nov same problem happening there so I'm returned that,3
"Everything is quite good as per its price but the irritating part is its pin keeps coming out of the jack of Redmi Note5, it ruins all the joy of binge watching.",3
This look just ok ok. Signal strength seems not good. My previous linksys wireless router was much more efficient. I would say this can be skipped and find better one. I bought in emergency as my wireless router was suddenly dead.,3
Little problem with accuracy but overall awesome product from mi,3
Entry level headphone. Sometimes voice is feable.,3
This product doesn't have built in speakers so i dislike it. Should i change this with some other model having built in speakes? Please advice me.,3
"This watch come up with syncing issue. Most of the time you have to sync your app with watch. Altough, touch and everything is good.",3
They don't give fast charger. They give normal charger with phone.,3
"Phone is okok, (speaker)sound quality is really poor, especially on call üëéüëéüëé",3
Plz.. don't go through review bcz. May be why these reviews are support this products. Sound quality is not good I have a f&d 2.1 speaker it works properly rather than zabronic.,3
Camera is worst ...,3
Battery life is very poor,3
Wifi keep on fluctuating!,3
"Stopped working after a year, contacted support they provided replacement without adapter.",3
Good about this price,3
"Problems you should know before buy. This is a great product but
It measure heart rate if you are not wearing it Means give reading even if you try to measure heart rate without wearing it.
Not 20 days battery life, it's a gimmick
Charger do not fit in capsule
Count steps while riding
Didn't come with spo2 monitor like the competitor.
Less accurate sleep monitor.
Screen to body ratio is very less.
Every thing else is good",3
Battery Back up Maximum 7 Days only not more than that,3
"Good product in low price.
Not fingerprint.
Good battery life
Average camera quality.",3
"Its a great product overall, bit pricy , with in a month only sound stopped in left head phone due to poor pin (lose connection) internal wire must have been disconnected. So i have to fiddle around with the sound jack pin to get it working, its very annoying everytime... So i stopped usung it, the product came with warranty, but no warranty card, website was given, even their contact number is not present, nothing came in the box, even the user manual was missing... I have no idea what to do to get it replaced or claim it under the warranty...",3
Just an average device if we see the accuracy of the numbers it provide. But considering the price perspective its the best at this range.,3
"This earphone is good but I feel material of the phone must be improved to give a premium look and feel.
Sound quality is average . Bass is good.",3
I liked this printer but printing cost was high.,3
"always issue with connectivity, not working properly, some times one bud only working other one not working properly",3
Sound is good but when u use fm the sound will be very distrubed.. And if u are a bass lover then don't go for ir,3
This is now useless for me.Because I want a modem but unfortunately place my order as router. This is not your mistake. Its my mistake. Sorry.,3
Does not work after 3 weeks,3
"This is a simple, old school, wired printer for light, basic use. Haven't had it long, so can't comment on print yield, etc but it is straightforward to set up, *as long as you are using it with Windows devices"". HP customer service is pathetic and humans there are incredibly difficult to access... I will not be buying HP again.",3
Product is nice but only for 1 yr after that occurred some technical problem,3
its quite ok not too good! the subwoofer damaged after 2 months,3
"It has a lot of good features like Guest networks and the detailed control over them, but the major problem is that it doesn't support 5Ghz bandwidth in devices that do not have 802.11a wifi protocol, which are the newer phones, laptops, etc. It works with older phones. So it doesn't help much with the dual band concept. So it's better to buy a different model of TP link which supports all 802.11a,b,g,n.",3
WiFi is not working,3
"This earphone is good, but I would not suggest it to anyone because MI basic is much better than this. So you're planning to buy earphone under 500 go for MI BASIC, I've been using it for past 2 years and still it sounds pretty good.",3
This mobile redmi 9 power+ selfi cameraüì∑ very bad please improve,3

I had to buy tplink adapter to make it work.",3
"Wifi singnal and installation is good but router reboots itself frquently. Sometimes it hangs so we need to reboot it, after that it works. Tried to resolve by upgrading firmware but still the same issue.",3
"BP tracking, temperature is wrong. It did not show temperature even when person was running high fever.",3
3 year warranty is mentioned but no warranty card inside.,3
"It's not worth it .
No doubt it's got that classy look and touch screen features.
No proper track of activities,sleep and data synchronisation.
The company dosent support the features and tracking well.",3
one scanner is good and free other wrk is very highly cost,3
"This Sony product really went under my expectations. I never thought I'd say that.
Pros: Cool looks(I guess?)
Cons:
Inadequate performance overall.
Extremely average sound delivery specially coming from Sony. Yes, a little all-rounder Realme Buds Air 2 leaves this in the dust.
Bass is faint.
Noise cancellation is almost non-existent.
Ambient mode is useless at higher volume.",3
This phone is average in this price segment,3
It's working fine till now but signal range is really bad. 2.4GHz has poor signal range(5GHz is bad but that's understandable),3
Charger adapter is not working I get dameage adapter,3
"1. It does not connect with Google Fit. Always comes out with ""network connection failed"" while all other apps r running.
2. Pathetic gold(it's not gold its orange colour) n pink strap combination.
3. How to change d strap? And where can I buy change of strap.
4. Watch faces should b innovative. Available ones r so disgusting.
5. Wl write about performance after a week.",3
"Overall good, but when it's more than 15 mnt then ..it's pain and need to adjust.",3
inspite of following the instructions the printer has frequent jams and does not print when given and prints sometime later which is quiet annoying.,3
Initially I received a broken printer which was relace new one after doing some calls .Initial review of mg2577 print quality is good but not excellent. But i find that scnanner quality was very poor as compared to other printer . Ther was no sharpnes in image scanned by the scanner. I have takken about 5- 10 pages . I have opned the printer found that the build is good inside and there was good protection for catridges . As compared to hp its catridge are cheap u should always try to refill it with prodot ink or go colour ink as your choice thank u,3
Ok ok kind of headphones. Expected better,3
Initial Setup was simple. Speed decent. But the Range is not good ... Covers very small area in a realistic apartment layout having concrete walls.,3
I have installed the modem at ground floor and the signal strength is so weak VxRail at first floor and not connected any device there,3
THE PRODUCT I RECEIVED IS DAMAGED THE RIGHT SIDE ANTENNA IS BROKEN... PACKAGE IS FINE... I HAVE NO TIME TO RETURN THIS PRODUCT AND PROCESSING TIME... SO I DECIDED TO GO WITH THIS BROKEN PIECE...,3
Very lazy screen for time watching.,3
Bass is good. Tremble is annoying. Noice cancelation is bad. Or nothing to say.,3
Good for small house but bass is not so high,3
I was hoping for much better performance as compared to my older router. This just happens to give a moderate performance in terms of coverage as compared to a product half the price.,3
Good for short time ups for WiFi router. I had bought one a year back. It's battery is now not working. Hence bought second one. So u can expect this product to last a year or so.,3
"Sound quality not good as expected!
Battery backup is not good, after giving full charge it's lasts hardly one hour!",3
"Watch is good considering its price. But Spo 2 measurement just stopped after 24hrs. It‚Äôs showing MEASUREMENT FAILED. And after 24 hrs Stress Monitor is also stopped working and showing that same Failure Message. So Retuned it

Pros:
Display.
Bpm is 90% accurate.
Customised Watch faces.

Cons:
Strap quality is not good.
Battery lasts only for 3-4days.
Spo2 stopped working.
No always on display",3
The phone is bit slow. Toggling between apps and recent creates a problem.Hope Mi will resolve the issue.Otherwise a Ok phone for basic needs.,3
Good product and quick delivery,3
It‚Äôs good product for listening to music. Very bad in office call meeting. Even person on other side on call will not hear you clearly,3
JBL is brandname but it's rather not headphones is way better than ear phones of the same 50 rs ear phone from Delhi railway station sounds better than it,3
"Single range is very medium
I thought the range will high due to four antenna.",3
Good product but takes more ink and pages incertion sucks,3
Camera results is poor as per 48 MP camera given,3
Good product but could be better in the price range.,3
Requires lots of ink cartridges and not recommended for people who print a lot I printed about 50-60 pages black and white and the cartridge was empty,3
Nice but I don't like it,3
Speed,3
Good but not signal range,3
"Reliable and it was easy to configure.
However I am disappointed with the range. For me, the signal dies after 40 feet.
With in the range there is no problem -- the connectivity is stable.",3
As it says dual it suddenly drops signals ans re intiates it self.dual igms not working,3
"Not accurate don't buy
Extra steps get counted
Honor band 5 is very accurate as compare to this...",3

"Phone is descent, will be handy for parents who want a low budget and hassle free smartphone.",3
"It's really promises good decent sound with bass, build quality is sturdy .. Don't expect too much at this price.. Just go for it",3
Product sound quality and everything ‚ò∫Ô∏è good. But ; I used to get headache if I use even less time too..... So it's better to improve that headache problem. Thankyou still Amazon. Plz üôè improve the product still.....üòá,3
"Returned this item since it does not support Gigabit speed on LAN when used as a repeater.

"Hi ,
I recently bought this product , It was working fine for one month with better sound experience , but now only right ear piece is working ., Left one stopped working completely . I don't know what happened .

Thanks,
User1",3
Its been 6 months and it is Working good ..does not provide excellent wifi coverage...just work decently with 3 phones and 1 laptop beyond that its super slow!,3
"Like the watch, but BP measurements need more accuracy, liked the music on n off setting, ... Work should be done on accuracy",3
"Slightly
Heavier",3
It's not that great.. one has to hold the Mike very close then the voice is audible the other side.. I would say ok ok product.,3
Installation is a problem here specially when you are installing through phone the server lags frequently...,3
"Good vital band, sleep tracking works. Accuracy needs time. Synchronisation works slowly. Overall it's good. SpO2 works. It's a go to fitness tracker. Mobile app is also good one.",3
Not worth for money,3
"Considering the price point, it offers almost all basic deals available in the market, however it lacks the proper functionality of touch screen, sometimes it feels like I am pressing a button on the touchscreen. Battery is okay, camera is just fine as per the specs. Rest is fine.. for 6k, it's a considerable deal.",3
Super Bad Camera.. Its not 48 MP. Even 8MP camera is better than this . Very disappointing product. Don't waste your money.,3
"Working very well with out drop down, but felt costly for this small watt product. By adding few more bugs we could be PC ups",3
"It's sound effects are very low and can't expect much. Quality also low,, durability is ok.",3
WiFi still gets disconnected during power outage,3
It's good one but that much great . Ink cateradge is the problem.its very higher cost,3
A choice don't regret,3
Battery life is one of the worst .. anyways there are multiple modes to set it right when not in use .. rest of all the things go perfect .. if you can charge once a day it will be a good product to take,3
Good but hanging problem,3
Product has hoting problem,3
"Every time I press the coloured or black and white button for multiple copy üò°, there is no setting panel for multiple copy. üò°üò°",3
"not working after 5 months. suggestion go for Indian brand like crossbeat, mivi etc.",3
Sound and bass is normal but low price on wrothable procut but volume increase not clear sound,3
Phone is good.... But had adds and it's not made in India.... It's Made in China so 2 star less....,3
Wow Speed I'm getting what I have Paid for 5G I loved but want some improvement in 2.5G band Speed loss near Router MU-MIMO it Doesn't do it's job,3
Goodüëç,3
"Basic things
Screen isn't scratch resistant and being sportmen
Not a preferable choice as complete display acquires sctract,
Battery quite good if usage is limited
Overall not for sport and rough tough hands.",3
"These earphones are pretty good for their price. The servicing is a whole other story, unfortunately.
One of my earphones stopped working after about 6 months of usage, I called the service centre to claim my warranty. However, they said that they DONOT service this device and will only service bassheads 200/225/250. Really disappointed. The warranty on these earphones are absolutely useless.
I reside in kolkata and this is the scenario here, can't tell about other cities.",3
Remote and AUX cable missing,3
"Ok to use , but quit heavy while holding.",3
Not very user friendly,3
"I had purchased M31 and wanted to get a second phone, so got this.
Latest OS , Good RAM and internal storage,
disappointing its released in Feb-2021, but didn't provide a 5 ghz WLAN connectivity (my mistake based on M31 thought this will also be available based on release date), also the Network signal gets lost very often.
Though it can be expanded to 1TB, would recommend spend an additional INR 4-5K and get M31.
Couldn't return.",3
Honest opinion. The hype is more than the truth. Mi and Boat earphones in the same price range have much better bass and clarity. Don't believe the hype.,3
"The watch is very good looking and very lightweight. Feels great on thr wrist the only con which is major for a smartwatch is that the watch is very difficult to connect to the smartphone. Once it disconnects wuth the device, it becomes difficult to reconnect and I don't know whether it is the smartwatch's problem or the application problem but I saw that this issue persists with other customers too.",3
Everything is awesome.. except camera. It S#cks.. Expectations was High.. and reality is...... DON'T BUY IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GOOD CAMERA PHONE.,3

MS Office is Paid",3
Good Product. But with a minor issue of Link Drop,3
Not the best phone i have used,3
i have bought this product a year a go at first it work very nice but after 6 months time it broke but thank god to the warranty given by boat i got new headphone but that also broke. at the end i will say the company is nice but this specific model is bad\defective so buy some other model product.,3
I am not getting any call notifications from the day 1,3
"I used it for pc, and mobile phone calls. PC was about ok, but mobile call conversation was very broken and not clear.
The bass sound was also weak because the headphone seemed too light for taking the impact.",3
Wifi signal break more time,3
Totally vest,3
Overall a good product from Samsung at this price range. The battery life is average. The camera quality is good. The display screen is large . Connectivity is good.,3
"I bought this recently. And after initial use I can say it is a good choice . I bought this as a fitness product.
The SpO2 sensor gives quite accurate reading with little error .
And heart rate sensor also gives accurate reading.. I confirmed both reading with Dr trust oximeter. Although for SpO2 reading it's takes longer time to detect.
Watch faces which can be stored in watch itself are just four, rest you can only change with mobile only , which has quite a number of choices from its app.. You can also use your picture as watch dial.
Battery backup seems good . After charging it fully two days back ,it still shows 55percent battery left that also when it's heart reading is on always on mode .
Sleep quality thing is still showing no reading available. It is supposed to be automatically checking the same.
Touch control is good.
Notifications for sms is good. And for mail and what's app is also not bad.
As per the packing is concern it was excellent.
So for such a price ,it's a very good smart watch.

After two months of usage , the oximeter stopped working. It doesn't even show in app . May be last update",3
Dont keep expectations on camera. Worst camera.,3
"Stop step counting multiple times, numbers are not accurate.",3
"Very nice user interface, very ""sleek"" space saving design.
But below par in output that matters (well at least to me). Power delivery is substandard, for both 5 and 2.4 GHz with highest power delivery settings. 5 GHz drops two bars in the second room, 2.4 GHz starts to disappear every now and then from the 3rd room itself. All these momo mimo limo etc, I really did not find of any use if I couldn't have proper signal power itself first.
So... NO, NOT RECOMMENDED.",3
sound was very low....eventhough it was on full volume,3
First month sound quality was good bass was good but all gone now seems like ordinary earphone. Also the mic is not that good as while on call other person gets to listen more from the surrounding & less from you when you are in crowd.,3
The quality of camera is not up to the mark. Fingerprint reader is a bit slow. One good thing about the phone is that it stabilizes and minimize the effect of shaking when videos are recorded. It doesn't get heated up after usage for some hours.,3
Refills are costly,3
Today I got the mobile mobile is gud bt heat bdi jldi ho rha h no problem I like the mobile u also buy this‡•§ For elders gud mibile,3
"To next room also signal is not proper. My home is double bed room home, I placed the the Wifi in living room but to the beedroom also the range is not proper. Gonna put return",3
The most popular of the routers but if you are looking for a long range router this is definitely not for you. As the signal vanishes with you to the 1st floor ! Good for small homes & independent rooms.,3
"It lasted me two months, dats it. One side doesn't work now. Let's see if I get a replacement. Hopefully jbl has some shame.",3
"The product is good,but the step count is inaccurate as is does not have gps function.
So it will count even when you just move your hand multiple times",3
I‚Äôm not able to connect usb tethering can anyone help me or any oppo support first it was working 2nd day usb is connected but it‚Äôs telling usb not connected charge also taking from PC,3
Touch performance was very poor,3
"Sound Quality is moderate. Built wise its pretty sleek. My review is based on 4 -5 months of use.
The comfort factor is pretty low. Feels a bit tight after few minutes, tried various setting on the headband.

Only thing I can say.... don't expect too much from these model. If you are looking for budget headset then go for it.",3
Sync issue I m facing. There was update on Noise pro app while updating again and again sync failed. After full download. Not understand why?? Just purchased so don't give more feedback..,3
"This router supports inly BSNL WIFI,doesn‚Äôt supports other broadband wifi.",3
Camera is not good,3
"Bass is not satisfactory and noise cancellation is also not good.
It also has lag in sound processing , the sound is heard after a second especially while playing PUBG.
Also there is disturbance during calls, the receptivity of the mic is also average.",3
Very good product fingerprints 0.3 sec instant unlock every thing is good but it's not gaming phone,3
Bass is not good. Overall good but sound effect and bass is not up to the mark,3
"I have had this for one year and three months now. It is not usable anymore, the wires are broken. But I think for its price it has given me a good service.",3
It needs to be reset once in a week.,3
So good,3
"Good size monitor for the price range.
Disappointed with the monitor height adjustments though",3
Nice product still lacks functions which come in other phones at this range,3
Good Product not so great. Ideal for a single room and hall. I have placed it in hall however the signal in the bedroom is not that good. I thought 2 antennas will give enough signal but that was not the case. The Guy at ACT Broadband told me to get this model. It is OK OK product. Amazon service as usual good. Delivered before time. I bought it for 1250 in sale. Next day it was available for 999 bucks . Amazon this happened to me twice. :(,3
"Connection issues ,always cam shows offline status ..even wifi signal is strong..will not recommend.",3
I bought the product on 8 march 2019. It has not been even a year and it stopped working. Everything is good except the longevity of the product.,3
Battery charging not fast,3
"Everything is dope.. Tip finishings are cool.. But one thing really disappointed me , High volume(Max) buzzles the sound , Weird static sound , And If you love different sound variations/effects , this is not NOT good for that purpose. It pufs the effects , it cannot bringup all effects , I am a hard core dubstep genre lover..",3
"has to be pushed in tight with my samsung phone, to work, microphone a little difficult for the other person to hear
tried it on my laptop, you have to insert it partially and hold it in place",3
"Though the product is good, fingerprint scanner is not working as expected. It's on the power mount and not user friendly. Size of the scanner make you inconvenient while using it.
It's not specified in the product description though it's mentioned in one of the image. Not sure if it intentionally avoided in 3-4 pages of product description",3
"Pros:
Good Amoled Display.
Strap is good.
Text messages and calls notification is really quick and handy.

Cons:
Low accuracy.
Tracks a bumpy bus ride as walking. (I spent a while day travelling in bus. - walked around 100 steos maybe and the band tracked it to over 12000 steps. (While its connected to ohone and GPS is On)
The edge of the display is prone to get scratched.

Returned it within a week as its step counter is very inaccurate while travelling in buses.",3
BATTERTY LIFE IS VERY POOR,3
"Good sound quality and decent bass

Pro's
1. Sound quality
2.bass

Cons
1. Sound leakage is very high, so not preferable for travel, sony MDR is fair better option in this price range.
2. Size wise also bit huge than expected.",3
It's not easy to install and sometimes it not print,3
"Camera quality horrible, Red eye in all night photos.",3
"Though product was good, packaging was not proper. Content was easily visible. Inadequately covered, possibility of getting damage or easy to alter.",3
"Good for songs , not at al good for phone call , really bad for phone calls , other person from the call cnt hear my voice sometims , and it so noisy at the time of calling.",3
Noise cancellation is not working.how to activate noise cancellation,3
"Mobile hangs alot. However, the product is worth for the price.",3
Liked the size and fitting. Music quality not great but okay. Noise cancellation very bad. Bass also okay. Average product,3
Too good a product at INR 700. Fantastic sound quality and recent production of August 2017. Happy with the product. Mic and speakers are very good with Crystal clear sound. The only challenge is longitivity. The chords are weak and snap internally very easily.,3
Worth to spend,3
"Mobile charger getting heat after connecting 5min.
I decided to replace the product and i fill all details and send it Amazon now they are saying we didn't receive any returns message from my side..... Better you go to serive center and claim there only we are help less.",3

"Fingerprint sensor ok
Battery life ok
Camera quality not corr",3
"I bought it for 4999 and won't recommend it.
Did not return so as to prevent seller from having a loss.

This router has a problem of frequent wifi dropping

The 5 ghz range is very poor and doesnt even cover a 2 bhk properly.

Better get wifi 6 for this price.",3
Head phone was missing in box,3
"The product was good, had bought some products too, while buying the products, the same, was available in prime only for a better price, free trial was offered for a month availed it. After a month Rs. 999 was automatically deducted from my account I was shocked. I called Amazon and checked, they said auto renewal for prime membership. I said I did not opt for it. I don't use Amazon prime other than explicitly buying products that too as featured by Amazon. I don't see movies, use any of the services of prime except buying products rarely when needed.

My discussion with customer service team told me it is auto renewal of prime membership if you opt for free membership ( I did not notice or understand it ) while taking it ( may be my mistake I accept it). My Rs. 999 was reversed after painful interactions and escalations with Amazon

I am annoied and really shocked that if Amazon studies my foot prints and understand my interfaces with them. I am not an Amazon Prime Customer, there is no necessity and need. They should not recommend or sell the service to me. Going by a Healthy CRM process, understanding the foot prints and buying behavior ( need of the customer) accordingly products and services is to be sold to the customer. In this case just because I went for the free trial and didn't notice the auto renewal terms mentioned therein, money without my consent from my credit card was taken later returned. ( But with an unpleasant experience)

But during this pandemic time when Life is at odds. Strategies of Selling, Upselling, cross selling products and services when need is not there is not acceptable, without consent from us auto debiting money is not right. Just because our account detail is at your access, this gesture of yours is not appreciated and sadenning. ( You may say that auto renewal clause trails below, in our frantic attempt to buy products which says that 2 more only left. All this is not quite Clear, legible, explicit and understanding to the customer )

I had held Amazon in High Esteem and Gloried its services and offerings. But now the Trust and Reliability is buried in the deep shallows of the sea and would never horizon again in our minds",3
All good except no finger print and easy to work all good in phone super,3
The product was sold on Sale but the claim about its battery capacity is not true at all. It needs charging after 2 hours of use.,3
Average product not so good not so bad,3
My ear phones right side earplug is not working now and ear phone is under warranty,3
"On ear sponges of headphone will get disturbed and started tearing off after some days.

If i slept in day time that data not mention in the App.",3
"Sleep tracking - 95% accurate

"ITS BEEN OVER A MONTH TO ITS WARRANTY PERIOD AND NOW THEY HAVE BROKED DOWN! II HAVE MIXED OPINION FOR THIS PRODUCT! STILL, ADVISE TO NOT GO FOR IT",3
waste printer it stop working within 3 months,3
"Sound is OK , but others hear echo when i use microphone. Giving 3 stars bcoz i use it only for songs. But if I use it for any office calls , m getting headache, bcoz too much echo.",3
Worst product battery backup ok but bluetooth is frequently disconnected from moblile without any intimation on phone call voice is not clarity no noise cancellation,3
The Calories Counter Accuracy is really bad.,3
"wanted to use as wireless extender, did not fully served the purpose.",3
Using since Monday after mi band 3. It has lot of new features but calculations are not good. Even while walking it stops. Automatic detection happen after 4-5 mins of walk.,3
"Product is good but WAN port not working after ‡•®‡•¶ days, might be quality of WAN port in the router is not good for this item.

I was satisfied with product but due to technical issue I have added replacement order.",3
"Pros- amoled display, notifications,

Cons- accuracy of the step count. It is exaggerating the steps over many times the actual value. It will count even during sleeping, in journey, in hand work .

As a pedometer and energy calculation -- it a very down down down down.",3
The bud is hard to handle. I had difficulty in finding a fit into my ears. Has a nice connector cable which doesn't tangle much. A okay product.,3
Good modem and router. .. has little trouble with range in other rooms.,3
"Fast delivery.product is good with in price
Sometimes microphone is not working properly. After reconnect again it is working.",3
No true bass or stereo sound. Overpriced.,3
Touch screen not working properly..,3
"I am facing issue with network latency , while talking on phone there is always latency for 2-3 seconds and call speaker is too low. Sometimes I don't get the clear voice.

Apart of that camera is good, it works with night mode once we will on the flash picture is too clear. but video stabilization is not good. While video shooting you will get some laagging in the video with front-end camera.

Battery life is too good.

As we don't have fast charging so it's taking near about 2 and half hour of charging the battery. Once battery full charged then it stays for long time.

Speaker of the phone is not powerful.

Processor of phone seems good.

Not good for a long time call.",3
"Too slow phone, and worst camera, but in case of battery its good.",3

I can't contol the music in this......i can only pause and play music cannot change it.....but nice produc overall,3
Needed another set of sensor which is on cartage ( black & Tricolor),3
"I bought mi band 4 with a lot of hope .... And here is what I think:-
1. ACCURACY
Within first few moments of wearing the band, i realised that the step counter is not at all accurate. It counted way too many steps from the start. Later I found out that the steps were added even when I swung my arm like pendulum. EVEN IF I WASN'T WEARING THE BAND..... Clearly it all started on wrong foot... Although I would like to mention that it's heart beat sensor was pretty accurate. And sleep tracker also failed most of the time.
2. BAND DISPLAY:-
band display was good and pretty satisfying at times but it also came with some problems.
As u can see in the images attached to this review.... There was a pruple strip at the lower end of the screen which wasn't visible under artificial lights like torch or when you are indoors... But when u come under sunlight it is clearly visible. Camera wasn't able to capture a clear image.... But the strip made me frustrated every time i looked at the band as it was visible even when the band display was off... Many people found this same issue... So i replaced it... And found the same issue In the other band that came as a replacement... I would like to mention that only thing good about this band is heart monitoring ....",3
"Camera is not good. I'm very disappointed with 9 power.
Best option, In 10999 poco coming with 6gb ram,",3
Sounds good looking good but only 6months used problem with back parts,3
"This is a cool watch. It has many watch faces and new watch faces are uploaded everyday.
I liked the feature of customisation of watch face. I wore it in rain and nothing happened to it...
It monitors your sleep too...
I am little disappointed with it's sport mode.
.when you start a sport mode ...it continues to measure your heartbeat due to which the battery drains really quick (almost 7-8% in 10mins) the battey backup doesn't seems to be what company claims on a normal use it would be around 6-7 days..which is disappointing..",3
Touch screen is good but sleep tracking not works well enough and there should be more options for other app notification,3
Overall Samsung Galaxy M12 is very good phone with extraordinary battery performance.,3
"The product was opened and used, no proper packaging, but it was working good, and I required it urgently do didn't returned. Take a video of unboxing just to save you from this kind of things.",3
"Product packing was really good and it includes HDMI cable as well.
If you're looking for a cheaper option for just programming, netflix and stuff connected to your laptop, then definitely a good buy. But if you have to do anything like remote connection, light designing work or light gaming etc.. then probably you might want to spend a little more..

Now manufacturer/product issues and which costed the rest of the three stars:
- It's not an edge-to-edge display (check my first image & it's quite easily visible)
- Ghosting issue (especially while on remote connection)
- Games like Asphalt 9 cannot be played easily (fps issue)",3
"The product is quite good, nd light wight. Easy to port nd use. The WiFi connections r good enough. The price is quite high for this product. Thts why I rate it by 3 stars.",3
Quality of sound is good but one side not working within 2 months of purchase,3
"Display: good at this particular price point (under 4k)
Senors: heart rate and spo2 works very well. I‚Äôve tested with oximeter, results are 90-95% accurate.
Wrist sense could be better.
Connectivity: I‚Äôve been using this watch with iphone. connectivity issues are often because of the terrible noisefit app optimisation. Noisefit app need lot of improvements and bug fixes.
Issues while updating watch faces. Need to close and restart the app while updating watch faces. I think all these issues can be solved by app update.
Strap quality is ok, could be softer. Since it has no amoled display, they should have given aluminium body so that there‚Äôll be no significant price hike.
Find my phone feature is not working sometimes.
Other workout feature are working well but don‚Äôt know how accurate they are.",3
"The headphone functions very well, good sound quality. But it fits tightly on my ears. It pains if I keep it for more than 30 minutes.",3
"Performance wise good for short distance but more 8 mts, it's very weak",3
"Battary llife is 5000mah but low battery
Bakeup and gaming is very good",3
"While the print quality is ok, we cannot print more. I could print about 30 sheets (colour+BW) with the cartridges that came with the printer. Too bad.",3
Service is very bad from ptron. You have to courier this by urself if this product not working.,3
"Nice design , network is problem , i purchased tp link router that replace it all solution.",3
I purchased 2 of these to use one as a main router and other as wireless repeater . RANGE OF THE ROUTER IS GOOD Not anu extraordinary and neither low range . also the speed is satisfactory . But the issue i faced is making it as a wireless repeater . Thats another story that by some youtube videos you can do it but whats the point in all that of they can simply put an option in interface.,3
"according to the price, sound quality is very good. But the wire is weak enough. May break from the edges within 4-5 months of regular use. Need to keep extra carefully.",3
"Even after having three antennas,wifi signal is not constant it fluctuates frequently.",3
"This fone over all good,price also good,but the main problem is over heating, even I use a little time. I send this fone as a gift, but they complaint about this matter.",3
"The device itself works fine, but the performance is not to the level I expected based on the reviews, so they are a bit misleading.

Also the spec in the description is wrong, there is only 1 USB port, not 2.",3
"While the product does decently well in the Noise Cancellation department which is its mainstay in terms of features, what I was really REALLY disappointed about was the build quality on this thing. Just a month after purchase, the plastic on the side bands has started to fall away like ice cream in the summers. Literally fall away. The usage was also not that high, I only used it during calls and such. To add insult to injury, I am on an EMI for this, so essentially have to pay every month for a product that didn't last even a month of use (the warranty does not cover physical damage). The lower end Sony headphones didn't have this issue, no idea why this pair is this defective.",3
"Good product. 5/5. But the power cord is too large and don't fit sockets, so you have to buy another one.",3
Works OK. Setting up is non intuitive and a a bit tough with so many different drivers on website and then it shows multiple menus from which one has to select,3
"This headphone is not so good as compared to boat headphone. I do also use boat headphone where the bass is high and i can feel the music and can enjoy it. But this headphone is lake of bass and treble is high. So, can't able to enjoy the music. I suggest you if you're a bass lover then don't buy it.",3
"Sound quality is good.
But the head phone is too tight, it hurts.",3
"Looks like a very good deal right. 300mbps speed, 3 antennas, low cost. Well I'm really disappointed bc the quality is really cheap. It's made of really cheap quality plastic and the USP for me was 3 antennas that means more coverage (range). Turns out it had the same range as my old 1 antenna router. Looks sweet in the white though.",3
Inbuilt speaker volume is too low... Need to increase volume...,3
The product is worthy of not for the poor fit-in! Anytime it may fallout and gotta be careful handling it.,3
Good at this price. But noise app needs more watch faces.!! There are very few watch faces right now. Overall good product.,3
"It's ok, but the 5g connection is very bad and glitchy after few months",3
While charging the phone it is very slowly charging and heating.,3
Small screen unsatisfied with the product and no option for upgrade to higher variant should have a larger display,3
company claimed battery life is 7 -10days but the battery life is only 48 hrs max and the app connectivity is so annoying everytime the app crashes and the touch is not so responsive,3
Battrry that has charging issues.Back is one issue and the other one is charging.  Get some good battery from the store guys. This won't work for long.,3
The quality of the product is good however the durability is not good. In just 2 months the left air buds are not working. Trying to get in touch with the seller not happening. Please help,3

"Good printer for household.
But the software is too heavy and the printed ink takes time 5-8 seconds to dry completely.
Otherwise the design is very good, the speed is good etc.
Overall its a good value for money printer for household.",3

"Camera quality is not good, look like 13mega pixels camera, heavy weight, and display also bad",3
"The worst part of this router is the frequent signal drops. If you leave the lap top idle for 5 min, the signal drops. Have to reconnect each time",3
This camera is the basic Beginner camera. Nothing excites me about this camera yet but still I'm figuring out this camera.. Quality is normal like a good mobile camera so nothing cool..huh!!,3
"The best thing about the product is battery life
step tracking is good (not the best)

things you don't get is a perfect activity tracker
total calories burnt for a 2.45 km running and 2.45 km walking was the same that it
calculates calories burnet in case of distance and time taken instead of personalized way",3
Battery life is pathetic,3
"Audio clarity is pretty good, but the built quality is very bad not even 10 days the multi functional doesn't even click anymore and lot of very cheap plastic.",3
My monitor has a dead pixel already just after 1 month,3
Overall satisfied but call voice is not that clear to other person of the call. Not complete worth of money.... Philips cheaper than this works with same quality then why to more money for this.,3
"Installation is very easy.
However WiFi signal has not propagated to next room, which is like 5 feet away. Signal is good for a room with 150 - 200 sqft, not beyond that. I have returned the product. No issues with Amazon for returns.",3
Camera quality is very good in this price,3
All most good in this range home theater .Long time i search i got the good home theater.,3
It is nice,3
"Doesn't measure heart rate more than 140. I run regularly and my heart rate is usually above 170bpm for that time, and it measure that as 110-120. Pathetic. I'll have to buy Fitbit for accurate reading when I can afford oneüòÇ",3
"While this may work well for a Desktop PC setup, the monitor is NOT COMPATIBLE as an external display screen for a retina display device. The text becomes blurry. Also, there is no option on this monitor to disable the eye-care features (which aren't really needed in daylight) making the screen yellowish all the time.",3
"Wifi signal is fine, but range with 500q only",3
Good for basic use after symbian (like nokia 1100),3
"Actually every thing was all right for sometime . But its hard to say that . My headphones gets damaged.
The sound quality . Bass.. noise cancellation was pretty good for this headphone

But the product quality is not good

I don't know if it is about usage or not but
I ear speaker got busted
Cable got some wear and tear

After all it cannot be used",3
Overall Good except battery backup and having some heating issues I don't know why.,3
"Bass, sound quality is good but call quality worst. At same time while using continous..my ears getting pain. feeling iritated while getting pain.",3
Sound is bad,3
Product works fine for 4 months but one refill without using original cartage it's stop working,3
Initially sound was good but within couple of months the left earpiece's volume got very low. Not good at all. There are better earphones in the market.,3
Not the worth product has so much lag need to improve the touch not that great trackers üëéüèª,3
The touch screen is very laggy and does not respond to touch most of the times. Switching between menus is very very slow. The price point is very high for such a buggy watch. I don't recommend to buy this watch.,3
"The specifications stated that the printer is compatible to windows 10 and 7 along with some other os. But the printer hp2778 which was supplied to me was not compatible to windows 7 and compatible to windows 10 only. Although at the time of ordering I got it clarified also. Moreover on the package carton also mentioned compatible to windows 10,7. Due to this non conformity I had plenty of trouble in installing the printer. Ultimately I have to get set with a laptop having windows 10 as os hence incurring additional costs and inconvenience.",3
Look wise and battery wise ok but there is a little bit problem in app sinking,3
"If you buy this, please ensure to install in well ventilated area with lots of air changes. Gets heated up inside room even it ceiling fan is working and stops, otherwise signal strength is very good. So be cautious. Winters - no problem.",3
A good buy not great.. Volume levels are bit low but for a small room will suffice...While connected as auxiliary we here a hiss which at lower volumes remains hidden. The blue tooth and usb are perfect so is the remote function. FM can improve. A good choice in the 2000 range,3
It's on off button is not working,3
"Boasting of 4 antenna and still unable to cover my entire home with full signal. Though every room gets signal, sometimes its weak.",3
Easily heats up.Good item with good delivery,3
"What I had expected from this product. It's doesn't stand on my expectations.
So I'm not satisfied with this product.",3
Best WiFi router.,3
"No USB C port for this price. On PS4 HDR, monitor blinks... (not sure if it‚Äôs PS4 or monitor). Flimsy bezel quality. Blacks are really bad.",3
"Sound quality is little bit low. Bass is also low , not good for bass lovers. And you also feel pain after using more than an hour.",3
"Overall, the band is great, great battery life, minimal but relevant information and a great app with loads of details.

However a couple of things that are like tiny little grains of sand in your shoe:
1. There are times when even if I'm walking/running, the band just stops counting steps. And this isn't something that happens for a short time, sometimes that goes upto 40 seconds to a minute. There's really nothing you can do at this point but wait for the band to start working again.
2. I have had the band for 10 months now, and though I do use it, due to the good battery life, I haven't had the need to charge it as frequently. Hence I'm surprised why the charging dock has a problem as the module/capsule doesn't fit in the dock at all while charging now. So I've taken to using a rubber band to tie around the charging dock with the capsule in it, to secure it to the charging points. This is a temporary fix and I'm wondering how long before even this doesn't work, because the charging pod design is anything but ergonomical. And the wire is so short that it doesn't even let the pod sit straight for most cases where you are connecting to a charger.

If these were fixed in future versions, I'd say this is a decent band that gets the job done without being too fancy about it.",3
The parts are so delicate that they break by even inserting aux cable. Wasnt happy with the quality of the speakers. Very delicate to handle,3
Just received the product... writing review to Access warranty... Hope watch will work good.,3
Boat products are not good. This was the second product I bought and prior to this I purcased a Boat stone 1000. Both got spoiled after warranty period of one year. Also the service center is not easily contactable and helpful. Though the sound quality is good but reliability and longevity is not at all satisfactory.,3
Don't buy printing speed very slow.,3
"Ear phones are not earing sound

Good work,3
"The sound quality is great! But these headphones are not as comfortable as you can imagine. I had a pair of JBL headphones for 2500; Compared to those, these almost make my ears pain. It's not a perfect fit, because there's a little gap just below the ear. Elaborating on the sound quality, the bass and treble is just perfect!",3

"Using It Since 1 Week, Everything Is Good Except The Wifi Range It's Low.",3
redmi price is too much affordable,3
JBL earphones has a property of losing sound in one of the side after 3 months of usage......My sincere suggestion don't go for JBL...(as I had experience with 2 JBL earphones)..I might be saving someone's pockets..,3
Lower configuration so sort of slow performance wise.,3
not up to the mark,3
"The amount of features it offers was just so mouth watering that I ordered it after I broke my Fitbit. Pros include price, Amoled screen, plenty of features, good battery backup and not to mention the music controls and the pop up notifications..
The Cons on the other hand are a handful. First of all the ad says 24/7 heart rate monitor but the band only checks once you go into the heart rate monitor so it‚Äôs pretty idle most of the time( one reason why the Fitbit consumes so much battery was that it never stopped measuring the heart rate and everytime I lift my hands it instantly gives me the accurate heart rate ). The heart rate monitor is also pretty slow so you‚Äôll have to wait 10-15 secs before you get the results. And speaking of results while I was working out my heart beat count was 117 and after checking it again immediately I got 74 which was inaccurate...steps count did not increase in real time while I was walking(you can see the numbers climbing in Fitbit in real time) and also the band missed my steps a lot of the time and is extremely inaccurate. I‚Äôm not sure of the calorie count either since the heart rate monitor isn‚Äôt that accurate..sleep monitoring also missed my small awake moments on the very first night...I purchased this band thinking why should I buy an expensive Fitbit when Mi offers a watch with the same features for a fraction of the price..then I found out why the Fitbit was so expensive. It does what it‚Äôs supposed to do, and frankly speaking the Fitbit is never idle and that‚Äôs something you want to monitor an active lifestyle..not an idle one..almost every feature is inaccurate that‚Äôs why it can last 20 days on a single charge..For people who have not used other bands it may look good and cool but if you have used high end ones you‚Äôll probably think it‚Äôs a waste...",3
Heating issues and very average battery life,3
Great,4
"Looks wise very good, it has features like smart band, but the sleep tracking is worst, it doesn't track properly, you can see its showing sleep time 12 hours which is completely wrong. It comes with gorilla glass which saves from scratches. You won't get any extra straps. Heart and oximeter tracking is good. It has lot of sports features. It has a aluminum body. Looks very good but features it may have added something extra than normal band features.",4
Battery back up was poor initially. Service centre got the watch replaced free of cost.,4

"If you are Going to buy this printed for afordable printing then don't buy it
Can only print 20black and 12 colour apge per cartige which comes with it also
The cartige 803 is also very expensive I recommend to invest more and buy either inktank or laser printer starting from 8000
In other sense great products but didint like it as first time the scaber was damged then when the replacement came the package was damged so I retired it fully

I read such similar reviews and I am experiencing the same.
I started listening songs and liked the bass effect and overall sound effects.
OVERALL GOOD.",4
"Nice build quality,
Should buy.",4
"This is probably the best you can get in this price range. The only con about it while gaming is the absence of surround sound. So determining precise footsteps in competitive fps games can be difficult, i would recommend you up your budget up to 2k. Apart from that the sound quality, bass, noise cancellation is amazing.",4
awesome product....u can buy withiut any hesitation...,4
you can attach wired printer in its usb slot & make it wireless printer. Further you can attached pen drive in its usb slot & share it. with others. Only issue temprature i.e its get hits up fast.,4

So if I have to give I will give overall 3/5.",4

Good product. Value for money. Camera was not good as expected but in this price range it's good,4
this is one of the best headphones you can buy under 1500 rupees some good things are these are lightweight and have average battery backup of 5 to 6 hours you can use them for 2 to 3 hours non stop but after sometime it feels uncomfortable also the sound quality is not so great.,4

I have purchase this product today. It is not showing the caller names on the screen. Can any one help me on this?,4
Been using this for almost 1 year. Found no problems with it. The only issue is that when it is turned off from the main power source you need to restart it from the power button given in the back of router otherwise this product is good to use.,4
Good product. But liveview shooting required proper light measurement. In liveview photo capture is not easy.,4
It doesnt have finger print sensor,4
"Used now for 2 months. For the price of 999 the product is good. But range is only enough for a 1000sq.ft house only. If you have a 2 floors you may want a repeater. Configuration is very easy. Since the WAN port of this router is 100 Mbps max, this is not good for internet plans above 100 MBps",4
"good noise qaulity ,doesnt hurt ear aftr long use",4
"Considering the price,it is good laptop especially for school going children,serve the purpose,no problem in viewing online classes.",4
So far so good. Not bad at this cost,4

Print quality is good, and options and great. Scan works well.",4
Like it it have some good bass sound clarity also good. It has also noise cancellation if you have low budget then you go for it.Totally worth it. Between Sennheizer X-180 and JBL 100SI of course you will pickup Sennheizer for great Bass..Both comes with same Cost.,4
best rate with low configue for back end office work or intermediate purpose. good battery life. light weight,4

You cannot use the feature of call recording easily. U will have to press record while calling every time and the other person will get to know that u are recording it Average smartphone. Many better options in this range . Vivo and realme are good options,4
Nice build quality !!!!,4
"Should have spo2 software . Otherwise a good purchase. Good battery backup.
GO for it.",4
Very Good Router. Works perfectly fine for my 1300 sq ft home.,4
"It is a good UPS for a router. It can very well handle the sudden power failures, but it only provide backup for a few minutes.
I have tested it on my router Netgear DGN1000 and it only last for 15-25 minutes. Size is compact so it can be easily carried anywhere.
It lacks a parallel power jack for adding more batteries like a UPS battery or a car battery for batter backup.",4
Overall a good product.,4
First three or four days its not worked correctly but after that it gives me 1000% performance of tp link modem router and range quality is so good in this price,4
All are good but it does not accept 5G router speed and that is pity .,4
Looks good so far. Detailed review to follow,4
Same As per the product details given,4
"Look and feel is great..
Battery life is good..
Heart rate, Spo2, Bp are calculating decently accurate...
Watch faces are ok ok... But best ones are very limited...",4
The bass is awesome in these headphones. Battery life is also good. the noise cancellation is not very great but good and manageable. The cable is long enough. The bluetooth connectivity is ok as my headphones is not getting automatically connected to my devices as i tturn on the bluetooth. Good for gaming too. I play valorant and used this connected through wire.,4

Nice and good bass..Value for money,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 All is good.. But the warranty documents are missing I want them.. So what I have to do now.. Does I replace it Or not?",4
"The sound quality is good and the product is worth its price, I have been using it since last 2 years now and there are no issues. It works fine. But yes it is delicate, have to been kept inside a good container/case so that you can use the Headphones for a good amount of time.",4
Everything thing is okk but you have too buy a cartridge after use whose cost is near about 1800 so it's too costly.,4
"I am giving a Delivery day review!
Looks good and I hope it'll work good as well! Used YouTube for a while and it got a little hot, I hope it's not a bad sign or something.
And yaa it's a good phone at this range.",4
All over good,4
Had a DLink150 router before this which didnt cover my entire house especially the innermost bedroom - this one allows better coverage and I can access wifi signal of decent strength in the most interior part of my flat now. Ideal for 2-3bhk. Much easier & straightforward installation and access features than the earlier model that I had.,4
Best budget tracker.. The app could have been better.. so many bug in the app.. Hope the bugs will be cleared in future updates.,4
Ok good,4
Good phone but little bulky...Camera and battery backup is very good.,4
"Simple, cost-effective and easy to use",4
Watch is fine.but battery backup only for 5 days which in slightly lower as per company claims.,4
Great sound.. loved it,4
"I have been using this for more than 18 months, the sound quality and comfort level was awesome. The only drawback is, the quality of cable used in not satisfying. But, except this issue it is a good deal.",4
"For me it works perfectly in Bluetooth and while playing movies and songs... But due to my restrictions in television, when I hear songs in YouTube, the sound gets buffered to reach to speaker.

So better check for all compatablity before you opt for it.

But then satisfied with this since I don't often hear youtube songs in television.

Also there is no extra extension cables. Though they provide lengthy cables the lenght might not be sufficient to be set up to a living room which is of a little big width and hence need to cut it and put an extension wire (warranty cannot be claimed).

Beyond all of this it's still worthy of buying at such a price.",4
Product is good.... according to price and specifications.,4
"Heating issue , need to restart every 72 hrs , rest awesome performance , handles 500 mbs speed like butter .",4
Really good band,4
"Too much Delayed delivery. Sound quality is nice with deep bass but lacks high frequency response. High frequency is totally suppressed. To connect to TV, ARC cable is required which is not supplied with soundbar.",4
"I have said it time and again in my 30+ reviews of earphones and headsets, all this Extra Bass, Deep Bass and True Bass is a CAPACITY and not a Feature. You need a good media device to get that quality sound from the headset. It is like have a wifi router with a long range, it doesn't matter how far away from the router you can access the wifi if you have trash internet. This product is really good for the price, you get overall great sounds from this, I would recommend it to anyone with a tight budget.",4
"If you are looking for budget wireless over the head headphones you can go with it without 2nd thought!!

Now Detailed review
Sound and bass - 4/5
Build quality -3/5
Connectivity -5/5
Battery -5/5

- It's build is plastic.
- charging time is 150 min
- Battery backup is 10 hrs
- Also there is advantage that you can connect your laptop and mobile to headphone at same time
- Also when you use aux the sound is slightly reduced
- Overall worth product for its price (599/-)",4
Primarily bought this to track my sleep. Accuracy of measurement is around 85%. Decent product. Go for it if you want to try a fitness band for the first time.,4
"Bought this product a week back. This is what I've been able to conclude so far. B&W printing is good. Colour printing is below average. Installation is complex and time consuming.
Edit 1: After 15 days of usage. Pages are getting stuck. If you're printing 10 pages at least 1 will get ruined.",4
"I got the product yesterday only. The look is good, the belt is soft but not up to the mark. SPO2 and heart beat measurements are almost accurate. Blood pressure measurement shall have to be calibrated later. Others are yet to be checked as it is one day only. The app is woking fine and many faces are available from the cloud. Generally I am happy with this price range.",4
"Quick delivery by amazon. Did not expect that much fast delivery by amazon without prime. Highly appreciated.
Overall the material quality is good. But the wire quality not that much great. Bass is little low,treble is perfect, I have to adjust the bass in Equalizer. Overall sound quality is good. Price is little bit higher compare to sound quality.",4
Product is good in quality.it is having only one wan port.so you can connect many wireless device and only one PC via Ethernet cable.,4
Four Stars.Good product....minimum price,4
Nice product. Using it from the last 6 months. No problems at all. Range of Good for my home on 1ST FLOOR n it do connects me from the ground floor as well. Does exactly what it says. Worth the money I invested for.,4
Good printing Quality,4
The sound quality and bass is good enough for this price. However the noise cancelation and placement of the Mike is very bad. The Mike has to be held near the mouth if u want the person u speaking with to hear you. The realme earbuds are better in this price range.,4
It's good. Only wish it had speakers,4
"Badhiya he, sasta pad gaya, jyada der suno to kaan se pasina nikalta he... Bettery back up shandar he.. Le lo",4
All over the mi has worked on accuracy and has provided better tracking app. It's music control is also good you can also control it while watching YouTube. All over product is good,4
Its Very Good Product.,4
It's a good product in low price,4
bass and noise cancellation is not that great but a good sound quality,4
"Good product for personal use. Print scan copy in one printer, it is compact and good design wireless printer.value for the money",4
"Nice product, good range, working fine, value for money......satisfied.",4
"I'm using it for almost a month now, mostly for business use. It gives great performance advantage and portability. Best part is it boots up pretty fast, thanks to the SSD.
Touch screen is good.
Finger print scanner sometimes doesn't work, but it was expected.
I haven't tried any games on it. But have done some image processing, which provided good response and performance.
Speakers are very standard. Better usage is with headsets
I have an issue with the white board. Sometimes during meetings, it hangs up and the entire screen goes frozen. Background processing, or even the call doesn't stop but the screen become inactive. This happened a couple of times.
Camera is a joke.. Still can't believe why they aren't providing a better spec camera in mid range models. It's too basic and performance is pathetic especially in low light situations.
Altogether, it's a pretty nice machine for daily/ business usage with my experience till now.",4
"Overall it is good product. The installation is to easy and WiFi signal is also good ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I'm recommend this product. And also a budget friendly Products.
Thank you Amazon's.",4
"Awesome design & superb sound quality
Slightly disappointed wire quality
Like a lot JBL signature
Worth to buy this product in this price range.",4
osm this product is so nice I loved it .First I have been scared to buy this product but now I am so happy.This is the amazing product and this looks like little bit sensitive we have handle it carefullyüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ,4
Four Stars.Sound quality is like local made earphones not worth full brand to buy,4
"Nice phone
best specifications in this price range
Affordable
Long lasting",4
"I bought this headset (C100SI) and it was working fine for almost 5 months. After 5 months, not able to hear anything in the right side earphone. So i called CC and they provided me a new headset. That second new headset is just 6 months old and i m getting the same fault this time also. i called CC once again and they said like u have warranty for the first 6 months only so u dont have a replacement this time. So this C100SI life span is just 6 months. After that you have to look for another headset. Please choose your headset wisely.",4
"Putting my feedback after ~ 2 weeks of usage.
I wanted a compact home theater for my bed room and after long and detailed comparison I found this speaker worth buying because of sound quality. I still had doubt in my mind because of many review from other that base output is very low. Something which I was not happy about is "" this is made is China product"".

I really don't think there is any issue with base. It's decent as expected from 2.1. but yes if you compare this with Dolby home theater then yes you will see some difference. Sound is loud and I don't think I even cross 50% of sound output. Also I don't think switch for base adjustment is needed. Also if someone want to buy 4.1 or 5.1 then go for base barrel home theater. Those are less costly and come with very good sound output quality. It's a made in India brand too.",4
Good networking solution in this price segment obviously you can go for it if you know how to use it then only bye thank-you.,4
I am writing this product on the day I received the product. I am using it with mac mini (2018) no issues. I have tested it for browsing and movies. I have not tested it for games as I am not into it. I really liked the reader mode and very wide range of adjustment features provided with the monitor. The button given for the feature adjustment however does not look long lasting. I have given four star because they could have given a button of better quality for adjustment. The clarity with mac mini is fantastic for 1080p and 720p. They additionally have 1920 x 1600 (very good for reading). The hdmi cable along with it is okay but I prefer my belkin cable which is more smooth in terms of plugging in or out with mac and monitor. Overall seems a nice monitor for the price let us now see how long it can perform at this rate.,4
"-Amazing performance.
-very easy to install and set up.
-So impressed with the performance that after getting the delivery of router immediately ordered another one.
-Both packages delivered on before time.",4
Got it delivered in three working days. Setting up is slightly involved. It's better to follow the videos provided at canon website than using the manual provided. Print quality is good. WiFi works well. Recommended.,4
Watch is good but packaging is absolutely bad and I didn't get mannual book then how can I understand and use watch,4
Camera video quality is good & easy to intall but more technicalities required for watching the live video over mobile,4
For this price it is an excellent phone. Works really great. Looks stylish. I bought it for my neighbour. He has given good feedback.,4
"One of the best router I have used till now
Pros
Excellent speed
No network issues
Easy to install
Budget friendly

Cons
Nothing till now",4
Looks good so far,4
"For the price range (below 1000 INR), this is value for money. I checked the price offline and it was around 1200 INR. So this is a good deal.
I hope to try JBL's better versions in future (I think its called 150 and 210).",4
The bass quality is good but my sony and bose headphones provides me a better bass. All over it is a good product for people with small budget.,4
The average reading is ok on the whole,4
"Its one of the entry level headphones from Sony and my expectations while buying this were as such. Audio is clear and base from headphones is good. If one has budget to up, buy mid range headphones like the 450 series which delivers much better base and build quality",4
Below average product. Please go some other option.,4
Worth every penny under this price range.. And even works against rain too.. Loved it! Go for the product anytime,4
"We have extremely thick walls, so this doesn't go beyond 1 thick wall, but it works better than our last router.",4
"Pros:
Awesome sound
Long Battery life

Cons:
Hurts a little after 1-2 hours of use",4
Working good condition.,4
u can go for it without any hesitation if u wish to buy an inkjet printer(according to your needs for printing) rest all fine best printer to buy üòÅüòÅ,4
"This is the review after 80 days of usage

Overall nice phone based on its price , nice display, good battery life , very good fingerprint and face unlock . Good back cam and average front cam . Can play full hd+ contents from netflix . Stereo speakers which gi
ves decent perfomance . Battery back up is great (with massive 6000 mah i can use pretty hard about 1 day )

Cons:-outdoor visibility is pitty
Over beautify front cam(as per my opinion this will vary with others) but thanks it supports GCAM . Soo with Gcam we can say good cam.
Lots of bloatwares(can unistall and disable so not a big issue) .

So this is it in my opinion cons of this phone are negligible .Believe me with this price range there is no other smartphones which is good as this .",4
"First of all, delivery was swift, actually a blessing when you're about to leave for hostel soon, but uncertain when. Besides, packaging was awesome. The piece soothes my ears. Don't know what's it going to offer me, but it has been quite good since the last hour ever since I recieved it. Don't know if it lets itself down later.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The watch gives accurate measure and the strap material is awesome üòÑ and it is too smooth. The best thing I liked about it is the response from the noise team is fantastic they are too friendly and give the solutions for any problem",4

but not satisfied wid the availability of its accessories üòê",4
"All good except battery... Dont expect to run for more than 3..4 days at normal usage.... That's the only drawback else all good.. Including looks, weight, app etc",4
Overall Good product from noise. Sound quality is is really good. I would have given 5 star only if noise cancellation should be there.,4
Awesome performance,4
"It is the best headset.
I like bass &sound quality in Bassheads 100.
In this price range it is best
And good servicing.
But dislike me about the shape it is slightly irritating my ears for continuous using.",4
Sound quality is good but bass of the product is some low,4
"In this price range ,this is best player üëçgood bass but there is no bass and terible control but there are various equaliser presets mods ..light effect in subwoofer is too good in dark
Fm, pendrive, card , and bluetooth and 3.5 mm support",4
Very nice product,4
Overall good phone in this price.Excellent battery life.,4
Bought this before 4 months ... As of now no problem found,4
Liked everything about this.. it's sound quality is good.. nd also filters noise around it while using the mic,4
Nice mobile good for daily use for parents level bit heavy due to battery size. Good back design. Firm grip. Nice battery back up. But display is not up-to mark. Lots of bloatware that I uninstalled. Beware of the keyboard which redmi mobile asks for installation .always use genuine keyboard like googles own provided in android. Even with all the boycot china mindset not sure how the manufacturers still release phones with such bloatware and software's that track our data even from keyboard.,4
It's good for any upsc aspirants,4
I bought this for to use as a repeater. Very simple installation. Working fine.,4
A1 product as compare to its price.,4
Very good product but delivery late,4
It's a good value for money. The earphone works well but its not comfortable for long usage. It pains if used over a continuous period of time.,4
Thank you amozon. Nice product,4
Nice budget smartwatch,4
"I faced some difficulties like automatic restart while scrolling down on notification tab. Secondly, weather update is not available at all time. It asks to sync with mobile but mobile app shows that it is synced. But now it's working fine...",4
Watch is working fine.. showing good spo2 but no is wrong.. it can be used only for spo2 and other activities monitoring.,4
"A fantastic printer for this price.

You can only use this for your homes.

Keep it to yourself if you run out of ink in it.

Buying a new cartridge can be expensive.

My mark 70%",4
Glucometer.Good to use,4
All good except my phone battery is draining up fast,4
Very good looking and style in wearing in hand.,4
"Overall A superb Smart Band with many smart Fitness features like
BPM Monitoring
Stress Monitoring
11 Work out mode including Yoga
I Liked Smart Features more than Fitness Features
From time to Timer
Music to Camera
Everything Is superb
I Think this battery will last for 22-25 Days

The major Con or negative I felt Is No SPO2 Calculator

But the price 2499 is just WOWWW...
I can't believe how they can sell this for this price...",4
Good phone and good color arctic white,4
Ek number..worth of money...and spl.. it's 5g...Samsung did a very good job here...loving it,4

Good quality and comfortable to use,4
Cool product,4
Volume control is not working with my realme 5 pro except that all thing is good but one things is not good about this product is if i am using mobile or i am not moving my hand like in poket the step count fail. This is my first time of such products so i don't know that this problem is common or it is bcz i buy low price product,4
Its the best in all aspects expect comfort and fit. It feels like it may drop.but for all other aspects its the best.And its calling quality is also fair enough.,4
Best products but very much expensive,4
"What I like:
1. Quality- it's totally awesome and very nicely build accessory. The jack is gold plated extra durable.
2. Overall sound: Good experience with the audio quality. Not the best in the segment.

Don't like:
1. Sound lacks detail. This could've been better consideing the price bracket. Relame Buds 2 have better details overall.
These sound okay. There shouldn't be any problem to an average user but the fact that it could've had more details in every band rather than only the highs, makes me cut one star.",4
Pubg is not working properly. Nice looking product and battery life is amazing . Camera quality is good .,4
good quality signal..,4
It was very impressive it doesn't need to be charged every day has magnetic chargic and lots more you should definitely buy this,4
"I had brought this product for my sister and guess what's next , upto 3 months It worked quite well but after that one speaker was damaged and I tried to contact customer care but the numbers mentioned on warrenty card were useless after that my sister lost her warrenty card but suddenly after losing her warrenty card her ear phones got right and set, I don't how it happened but the ear phones started working well üôÑ.",4
The colour options are very good and the featurs are exactly what I need.. Overall good product.,4
The sound quality is good than. Other company earphones. Bass is perfect not too much not too low. A balanced sound quality . Nice product at a reasonable price.,4
"Product is Good, easy to set up but not satisfied with the range off wifi",4
"Good quality.
For gaming best for under 20k graphics card cuz it's refresh rate 75hz.",4
"I liked the product, and I use it to check my fitness.",4
Bluetooth connectivity and sound quality is best.. smart and good product..,4
Good mobile in 10k price. A bit heavier as compared to other mobiles. Finishing is average matching the price range. Performance as of now is ok but can comment after usage of some days.,4
"Just little tight... Hope it gets loose bass is very good , treble little low , clarity little low",4
Nice phone within budget....,4
Lowest brightness level is not low enough. Everything else is fine.,4

"i like this product, good.",4
For the price of the laptop it is very good.,4
"It's really good product and it's colour is better, the printing quality is really very good and fast. At the first day I thought that it will not be a good product but it proved me wrong and it was proved that amazon is really a good e-commerce marketing platform.",4
"Material quality is pretty good, sound quality and bass is quite impressive , durability of this product can b used for long time",4
Document scanning is not clear otherwise fine.,4
"I like spo2 level and step measuring. But i am not happy with the app. Sometime data don't sync. So we missed the stat.
Noise fit improve the app plz.",4
"I bought it for my mother. The overall package is great for the price. Even though it is TFT display, it works like a charm. Battery and camera are average at best. Supports voice over wifi. It is a great phone for elderly people who are switching to smartphone for the first time. I choose Samsung as user interface is clean, ad free. Do not expect game playing or heavy app running. It does the basic communication job pretty well. Samsung has already released two system updated with latest security patch. Can't ask for more at this price.",4
i like this it is working well,4
Good budget printer,4
This headphone is very good i like the headphone but my headphone sound like distorting so this is problem with my headphone . You can buy it at good price,4
Battery life should be improved and frequent disconnect from bluetooth,4
"After using 1 month... In simple lines which every user wants to know... Quality is good, battery is min 5 days WID out charging, accuracy ..out door running is bit erratic, but walking and sleeping track is almost 98% accurate , touch screen is good, App is also good, bit unsatisfied WID belt",4
I just received the headsets and I must confess I'm impressed. The headsets are of good quality I would say fair for this price range. The sound quality is top notch ‚úåÔ∏è the bass quality is just okay tho it can be improved on. In regards to the noise cancellation I would say it's kinda okay but it's the main thing which needs to be worked upon. The headsets come with extra ear-pads and a tiny bag for keeping the headsets.,4
"Super mobile in budget segment
Best cam battery all in one.",4
Counts steps even travelling in car,4
Best headphone üéß in 800 good ..but more than 30 mins listening in headphones üéß burning ears..this item..,4
Nice watch but very delicate glass screen guard is needed,4
"Build quality of the product is nice.
Wi-Fi range over 2.4 ghz frequency is better compare to 5ghz frequency.

Performance of the product is better than my expectation level. It excels in performance.

Coverage over 5ghz frequency could have been better given the price point.

For small apartment or house range is fine but don't expect it will perform well for more than 500 sqft area especially 5ghz frequency band.

Overall it's nice product and will work for small apartments.",4
Good product for beginner value of money best product for low price thank you Amazon for this product plz buy,4
"Not awesome but good product. I would suggest to go for Artis which is way better than this. And Artis comes cheaper than JBL. For this product JBL should decrease the price. Artis comes at 350-400 and have a very good quality sound, more durable",4
Good aa.very good product,4
"The display is nice. I have paired it up with a mac pro so obviously cannot compare both, but still a good bang for the buck product.",4

No finger touch option for lock open,4
Good sleep and steps tracking. Can be a bit better in accuracy.,4
I like that's phone.,4
"I have been using these since 2 months
I don't like the sound comming out of it. Sounds like the 100 rupee earphones.

And the sharp frame behind the speakers poke my ear when watching youtube -sleeping on bed.

I have now fixed my old earphones and using them.",4
It's good but your ears start paining after some time ...fit is too tight,4

Valur for money,4

Good job,4
"bass is good not best.. bass sounds good only till level about 80%... after that bass try to distort and dubb dubb sound comes out
speakers are average only.. bar is for show off only and also too long ...only one speaker present there inside the bar

I bought this on yesterday so far all good. Before this router i was not getting speed in bed rooms. With this new router i am getting speed of 60Mbps out of 100Mbps in all the bed rooms. It best suits for my house,4
"It's a good looking smart watch at this price, but lot of scope for improvement.
The main flaw I noticed is the call and message notifications not working as expected. Because it will need a Noise fit sport app to be working always in background in phone to stay in connected to phone. If the app is not opened the notification won't work. It's a pity.",4

Amazing watch as per look and accuracy. Battery lasts 2 to 3 days when used enabling all the sensors and functions. One serious problem with this watch it keeps disconnecting a lot of times and sometimes u have to shut it down and reconnect.,4
awesome router from tp-link just a little bit expensive. for that 1 start deducted. otherwise you can go for it. offline market have cheaper than Amazon. you will get 1000-1500rs cheaper in market.,4

"The product doesn't come with a case/ pouch so safely storing it would be a cause of concern. Too early to comment on quality of the product, but the noise cancellation is good and has a very simple bluetooth connectivity setup.
Writing this review so as to avail product warranty, which is very weird clause.",4
router is good but charger quality not good i change 3 time,4
I got defective adapter from box but i purchased an separate adapter. router works good. . Ramge is nice.,4
Nice product.cool..............,4
"Nice phone just like any other budget Smart phone This phone had a serious problem of Charging ..it was very slow and took hours to charge the phone . Later after may attempts I realized that the Adapter was not working , the charging cable was working fine .I replaced the adapter with an Adapter of Redmi5 phone and now its charging Fast ..Better the company check the Adapter as there are several complaints here of Slow Charging .Overall a Good Phone",4
"Overall good product.
Good Value for money.",4
"Speed and latency is really better than my previous dlink router. But 5Ghz strength is not as expected. It won't reach one floor down properly. Tech support is poor, I called them initially for installation help because there was mac deletion issue with ISP as it is a PooPE connection. They were not really supportive",4
This product is easy to use,4
It's ok but display is small,4
I personally would prefer to use products that does one job well to doing multiple tasks in a mediocre manner. This printer is easy to configure and use though the driver doesn't seem to support choosing monochrome / color when printing which the all in one counterpart does. Otherwise it's pitch perfect for printing and so rated all stars.,4
YOU WRITE BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES BUT NOT BLUETOOTH,4
Better quality and sound value for money product,4
Very good quality have used for an year and half. Use it sometimes for online meetings as well. No problems and very clear sound.,4
"I like this product coz this is cheap and have Bluetooth..it got nice sound quality too..and bass is kind of ""eh"" but i only have 1 issue with this product that is when i hang it on my neck it is just too uncomfortable like i cannot hang it on my neck at all..and one other thing is that it is quite painfull on your ears too coz its cushion is too small so the inner part comes in contact with your ears alot so it pains. product quality can be better too..it just feels like it will break if i pull it too hard.. otherwise everything is okay..trust me‚úåÔ∏è",4
Nice so far,4

Really good working love it,4
Awesome performance for this price range. Mic is the only problem.. have trouble hearing for others on call,4
camera quality not so gd ..but btry backup is grt,4
The router is pretty bulky. Signal strength across walls and doors is a little concern. Signal drops at times especially on 5GHz band. Installation of router is dead simple. Managing through tether app is super simple. Overall this budget router does its job decently.,4
Good sound quality this price,4
"There is one issue that there is no dedicated BASS control button, hence BASS needed to be controlled through remote.",4
Very slow charging should have provide USB cable charger instead of normal charger at this price other than that I like the mobile,4
yes like is this mi 4c but ethernet cable not includeing,4
Average quality product but price is good,4
"Easy to use and value for money but inkjet cartridge is Costly about 1500 for both colour and Black catridge which not last longer, So preferred to Leaser printer instead of inkjet printer.",4
Very good device at the price. I paid ‚Çπ2999 for it. Looks stylish with the design and lights. Bass output is quite good. The voice is not that clear. Will be very useful if you want to listen to hard music. Not so useful for watching daily soap on tv.,4
Watch in the wrist looks nice,4
Overall a good decent product,4
A great product from tenda. Handy and easy to use as well. Perfect for cable Internet connections for a 2 bhk flat. And amazon service always at their best. Gave one day delivery for free.,4
Awesome product in this range,4
Great product nice performance range is very good,4
This band doesn't supports regional languages like Tamil Malayalam and app didn't gave any updates for that. And there's no option for sending a message when someone's calling,4
"Product is very good, but don't expect for the replacement even if its in warranty.

Hi Ganesh,

I apologize for this experience. I assure you that this is definitely not how we want our customers to feel.

I wish we could help you with the service of your JBL C100SI, however it can only be replaced if it is under warranty, since the product is non-repairable.

We consider your feedback to be of high priority and will work towards making your experience with JBL a better one.

Thank you so much for choosing JBL. We appreciate your understanding.

Sleep tracking is a bit off as if shows extra hours of sleep. Overall it's a good basic watch to track steps,4
"Best bass and noise cancellation quality, battery backup is also great.
Just one thing which i found as a con that is while on call the other person‚Äôs voice is too low even when i put the sound at maximum, i have to put some efforts to listen up and understand their words.

Overall it served my purpose and Its value for money üëç .....",4
"I have been using TPlink 300 Mbps Router for more than 5 years. Recently it started to give inconsistent connectivity and considered Archer C6 as an upgrade. Installation was pretty much straight forward and easy. Just keep your internet service provider account details and password ready before commencing the installation.
# Awesome speed if it is in line-of-sight at about 20 to 30 feet. I could get 144 Mbps Upload and 124 Mbps Down load speed. I use ACT direct FTH link.
# Speed drops by 75% to 85% for devices located just a floor above. Hence, landed up using TP-Link repeaters. Yet could not see much improvement.
# Dual channel setup works fine
# Lots of You tube content available to catch up any specific configurations. Like I used the old Router to setup as a WDS bridge.
# Happy with the purchase and price paid for it.
# 3 stars as it did not really meet the requirements for extended connectivity between floors. If I consider for a single floor connectivity - it deserves 5 stars and more!",4

"The printing quality of this printer is really good.. As i have used it.. So, in my openion its a good buy... But it has some bad side of it... i.e., Cartridges gets empty fast.. I didnot even print 50 pages there was a warning lamp indicating about low ink in both the cartridges.. It takes some time to set up and you have to do some printing ,xerox test and scan a sheet of printed paper as shown in manual then you are all ready to use it.. But the fact is if you use low gsm papers your ink will be sucked more and which results in emptying your cartridges fast.. So, I prefer not to use low gsm papers.. And try getting large cartridges.. Small finishes fast..",4
The sound quality is good. JBL's cheapest earphone it is. Bulit quality is not that great. Can't expect for this price range. Wires are twin and very delicate. Mic and noise cancellation is not upto the level. Buy if sound is more important for you than mic and build. Go for C200si if you can extend your budget,4

"Overall a decent buy at this price range. I switched from Fitbit Versa to this one, though there a lot of compromise on feaures & accuracy, still satisfied with it since it has all the basic functions needed for day to day lifestyle

Pros:
1. Awesome displays. Very bright and vibrant.
2. In-built GPS
3. Perfect size and premium feel.

Cons:
1. There is no Altimetric barometer sensor, so no elevation gain measurement. No floors climbed measurement.
2. Clock faces are very limited and not that great. Hopefully company will come with better clock faces in future.
3. Music storage is not there.

Providing this watch with little bit of Music storage and elevation sensor would have made this perfect fitness watch in awesome budget range.",4

I purchased the phone for my father. This is a budget friendly phone for sure. In my case the usage is minimum as my father is using the same. By this time I didn't find any big cons for the phone.

Bass- Good but not so comparable to MI Basic Earphones. Go for MI. 3/5
Sound Quality- Kind of similar to MI Basic Earphones. 4/5
Tangle- Boat rocks in this segment. MI Basic Earphones get tangled easily. 4/5

Stopped working one side of the earphone after an usage of 150 days.
Using MI Basic Earphones since last 15 momths or more. It is as perfect as it was bought.",4

"Using this watch for past 1 week. Here are the things I like and dislike.

Pros:
1. Extremely light weight and comfortable to wear.
2. Battery life is good. drops only 5 to 8 percent per day with full day heart monitoring on.
3. heart rate sensor and sleep tracking is very accurate.
4. The screen is bright and vivid and easily visible in outdoors.

Cons:
1. The Spo2 sensor is very inaccurate. it often shows measurement failure. After a lot of trial and error I found that it can not measure blood oxygen correctly if you wear it like a regular watch. If you want to measure Spo2 correctly, you need to wear it at least 2 inch (3 finger width) away from your wrist bone, and you need to wear it tightly so that you can feel the pressure in your arm. Then only it will show you correct Spo2 result.
2. If you turn on always on display the battery drains pretty fast.
3. The watch faces in the Zepp app are not good. Especially the analog watch face collection is pretty poor. There are no 3rd party watch faces available for this model yet, but I hope in few months 3rd party watch faces will be available like the old GTR/GTS/Bip models.
4. The Zepp app does not show the Y axis scale values in the hear rate graph. This is pretty annoying and hard to understand why the developer did not plot the Y Axis scale.",4

Good product. We need to confirm manufacturing country before placing order. As true Indian we may look for Indian options.,4
"I have been using this earphone for the past 3 months . From my experience the earphones are worth buying as no issues found till date. Reviewing about the sound quality ,it is quite good but it is missing the bass in it .You won‚Äôt be able to experience the full sound experience as the bass is not that impressive in this earphone.
The durability is quite good till date .The earphone is not tangle free though. The quality of the wires are above average. I bought this earphone for Rs.699 . I feel the product is worth buying for the money offered to me(even Rs.800 seems to be good bet).

I would not recommend this earphone for those when want to feel the bass.Finally the amazon‚Äôs timely delivery was impressive.",4

Rest I'm satisfied with the product and happy to give a 4*.",4
Sound quality is good and bass is also good. The color effect on the headphones makes it more attractive. Sound doesnt pinches in ears on full volume as well. Its value for money.,4
Battery lasts for nearly 8 days only,4
It just works well as expected.,4
Not appreciated Band 4 as compared to MI Band 3 better. We can okay only color changed & some music control option.,4

"A very good and quality product- Nikon dslr D3500 Camera. For beginners it is need to read the manual carefully and also must be educated in Exposure Trio means Shutter speed,Aperture and ISO to click manually. Everything is good but should have a shortcut key for ISO adjustment. I got the product in 28k with 18-55mm kit lens. It maybe 2k less in price compare to camera shops. I am rating giving you 4 stars. It's ok. I preferred Amazon. Thanks.",4
Nice but camera quality is not good,4
Good product. Works ok. Accuracy is 90% of the time ok. Step counter has improved greatly over the previous versions. Would recommend for the convenience.,4
"The headphones are nice and does the job well. Feels a bit flimsy on physical side.
Update: i have ordered third one because of the satisfaction i had from my first order with regard to the product
Good points:
Worth for the price it offers, sound quality and build quality and color options
One year warranty the manufacturer advertised
Negative points:
The phone number for registering the product which comes in the warranty card says this number doesnt exists and they are out of service along with a prerecorded audio message
The url for registering the product over website - provided in the warranty card, is reachable only if you are lucky, else site not found error is the result, could get the site only after 5 to 6 times trying
When registering the product the message says you will get a confirmation over phone as message and as email, though its been weeks after registration i am yet to get any sort of communication confirming the product is registered, hence blindly believing the comments by fellow customers that manufacturer will respond when contacted for warranty issues( will be required in case if the headset is having issues - till now after few weeks of usage there is no issue as such, but heard many had the issue of one earpiece not working after few months of usage, i am yet to reach that extent - not confident regarding the fate)
Would request @boAt manufacturer to respond on this and update the warranty registration and customer support other than providing a card along with the product with some non working url and phone number.

Reducing a star for the non response from manufacturer post registration of two products.",4
1.5 months of using it.. no problem faced yet. The look of the product is beautiful,4
This headphone is good. I will not say great like Senheiser because you have to up your volume a bit to hear clearly. Whereas in Senheiser headphone you can hear perfectly at a much lower volume. But the packaging is good and they are providing extra earbuds. 1 year of warranty is also provided with this product. I cannot say about longevity at this moment because I am only using it for one month. But the main attraction is it is available in various colours and the pink one is good. Also it is coming at a low price of 379.,4
Earphone have descent bass but lacks clarity even at low volume...there is fuzzy sound output at low volume...Which is very sad to expect from JBL.. Quality of product is quite good (Wire is thicker compared to other products I tried in past at this price range).,4
Not very accurate,4
Good camera for beginners.,4

Awesome product.. i am using this for my osmo moblie 3..,4
The is nice phone,4
"Let me begin by adding ""For the price"" -

1. Fit - Requires some getting used to, but i managed to it fit it properly to feel the music
2. Sound quality - Ok, so if you remove the price factor, these headphones are no better than low end skullcandy ones. Bass reproduction is limited to mostly thumping. You won't get much of that deep harmonic bass. Maybe, for this price, this is what you get. Don't get lured by the price, if you want great sound quality, go for the higher end ones.",4

"I am old fashioned hearing news, watching documentaries and listening to classical music apart from using these earphones for various calls during work from home. I looked for clarity in what I hear and clarity in hearing for my audience over calls, all with long battery life. I am not a technical person to get into processor details etc. So far I have found the sound/music performance decent and no complaints from others who listened to me over calls.

Only, if instructions on literature supplied in the box was clearer. There is a small plastic that covers those two bronze/brass like dots on earphones that connects with its relevant pairing spots inside charging box. This small piece is so small that can miss anyone's eyes. Because of that I was wondering for two days why my earphones weren't charging irrespective how long I kept them inside the box. Finally discovered those!",4

Initially small snag but all ok
Product seems to be value for money",4
"If you ask me, the phone worth it if you are looking for 5G in Samsung brand. With a couple of great specks like Samsung's #FastestMonster equipped with the blazing fast Snapdragon 750G processor. It comes with a long lasting 5000 mAh battery and a versatile 48MP Quad camera for capturing stunning photos and videos

Cons: though Super AMOLED Infinity-U 6.6‚Äù display gives a true-to-life to mobile, indeterminately display clarity would not that great since it is just HD one. At last even I don‚Äôt like the in-screen security as it would not work as expected, that maybe I have not used to it since I am trying 1st time and I am blind person though.",4
Using the monitor for last 1 month... So far experience is good. Picture quality on VGA is decent enough. Yet to test it with HDMI. Overall value for money.,4
Very good product for all in one,4
"JBL Sound quality is amazing. I always buy JBL headphones only.

Have a good microphone attached with active noise cancellation.

At this price range, this headphone have wires that could be easily tangled.",4
Good product with great sound quality,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Good for gaming. Not so loud(appropriate for gaming only). Absolute bang for the buck. Best one you can get in this budget",4
Everything is best about it. Best thing about it is the springy thing at its wire end which protects it from getting cutsüëçüèªüëçüèª.,4
"Very good item...but for colour prints in photo paper,there is a mark of roller line noticed ...otherwiseit is too good.got it for RS.7450.",4

good printer,4
Sound is not bad,4
price was lower than what i visited all online market,4
"Tangly wire, but great sound clarity",4
Good battery life...,4
Product is good. I am using 4 device at a time. Speed is good. But if I move outside from the room signal is very poor.,4
"Afer 1 month of use i giving review.. Band is very nice , lightweight . 14 days of battery backup is very nice compare to any other bands..you can adjust display brightness..strap quality is good but it's not secure..there is chance to fall accidentally...Xiaomi have to improve the security of strap bcz it's not secure...but overall it's comfortable band with waterproof...",4
Signal can be little more stronger. If I choose the wooden door of the room the signal is lost completely. As long as for is open it works fine. I use this a range extender.,4
"Easy to install , working fine",4
"I had a huawai router before this, and I could not access the connections in my whole house. I thought taking a duo antena router would solve this problem, but what I thought did not happen. And even its connectivity is a bit problematic as my tab would never scan and find its network. Finally I called the service centre and the problem was solved. Amazon offers a good price for this product (just 2000) In the markets of Pune this product is being sold for 2650.",4
Nothing to say much but the fire boltt smartwatch is amazing.it‚Äôs worth buyingüôèüôè,4
Worth the money but battery backup is not enough,4
"I have bought this product and tested it for two months and it is working fine and perfect, the best thing about this product is the battery backup it can easily last more than a week and the display is great and customize able. At this price range this is the best product you can buy.",4
The sound is really good considering the price I got it for ‚Çπ350 .. but when you wear them you cannot hear the surroundings even though music isn't playing... When volume gets high.. it gets little itchy.. but the price is what beats the above.. and the lows are really bad..,4
Good product guys go for it if u want true activity tracker,4
"It was a free home delivery. Packed well. Its been a week, going good so far. Installation was easy, connect the modem to computer, call the ISP(Airtel in my case), open the given IP address(in the modem/guide), fill in the forms with the help of ISP call centre, we are done.",4
Very good product. It has been more than one month no problem whatsoever,4
Nice watch but strap is bit itchy and sometimes you feel something is happening under your arm not sure if that is because sensors,4
"Good product as per the price
Very good phone a middle class",4
Nice mobile value for money,4
"Amazing earphones ..
I first ordered the earphone with it came defective but Amazon replaced the earphone with new one and now new one is working fine ..",4
"Steps are not that accurate.. u will see it adds up steps counts like hundreds when u ride a vehicle
Sleep tracking are somewhat okayish Does the work
Battery life tbh it's like max 4,5 days that's it",4
Battery is awesome.....there are 4 rear cameras .....but it looks 2 are working......,4
Really good product for the cost.,4
"Best product in this price range and has good features inckuding SpO2 measurement. Comes with a amoled display which is a plus considering the price. Tracking seemed alright, nothing to complain about!",4
"I found it to be lacking in bass which cannot be managed by using bass booster apps. Slightly disappointed. Also causes pain in ears after short time. Couldn't experience the expected ""JBL legendary sound"".",4
Really a very good & useful product. I really like it. But there is a problem with the charger. After few days it automatically bend that's why I have to use a yarn at the time of charging.,4
The build quality is pretty poor and gets tangled pretty easily. That does not look well. The quality of the audio is acceptable for a normal user. Bass is pretty heavy and noise cancellation works decent.,4
"Screen quality is good, battery life is below 5 days and accuracy is ok",4
"Nice product, I am using it from last 2 yrs. It takes some time to recharge to full capacity after it is used for 100% (3.5/4hr).

Resonate should very soon need to come out with a Router UPS compatible with Jio Fiber Router [12V 2A (While colour router), I dont know about Black colour fiber router power ratings). The backup time they need to plan/design to exceed 8hrs.",4
Ver useful,4
"The watch is nice and the display is big value for money but when I open it, it is somewhat scratch on back side near sensor. Overall very good watch I love it.",4
"Installation was very easy.. the setup, login etc are user friendly. The only problem is that sometimes the network signal disappears but gets back to normal automatically.",4
Canon 1500D is a good beginner's camera...it's easy to handle and also give satisfaction to beginners like me...a very good camera especially for close up photography.,4
Got best deal in great Indian sale,4
other than wifi signal good product,4
"The mic quality is great as is the audio quality. The fit is okay, my ears do feel a little sore after wearing them since the cuffs I guess aren‚Äôt completely big enough. The audio does sometimes randomly dip‚Äî as in I could be listening to a podcast, video, or something and the audio will just disappear briefly. Battery life could also be better, but it‚Äôs fine.",4
"It's very similar to mi band 4 ,but nice product",4
"Dr Morepen Glucose Monitor BG-03(Grey Color) + 25 Test Strips Free.Good device, and also value for money",4
"I was planning to extend my WiFI network and was in search of AC routers. I already own a DIR 816 AC which was working fine and wanted to find and alternate manufacturer which should be as worthy as DLink. TPlink is worth a buy and it has the minimum required features for Home networking. The hardware is good, UI is pretty much easy.

One problem i faced is the signal Strength. I was using my Android phone to find a good Spot for signal strength and found TPLink Wifi Strength is quite low compared to Dlink DIR 816AC router. I placed the routers on the same place ne at a time and tested the strength of it at different locations which showed Dlink was good than TPlink. Other than that everything is fine for me.",4
Really like it!,4
"The watch looks great, works great. Only feature that's still not working is the call notification. Have contacted support team for the same.",4
"Video quality is good, Size & quality as compare to MI cameras not good. Call & Talk function is very good.
Over all Camera is good in this price.",4
Very good router for home use. It is also fast if it is connected with 8 devices also !!! This has a very good network coverage .,4
recieve it . nice product at 6500 .but as discription 32 gb storage 11 gb already full by other aplications and 21 gb storage availableü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èotherwise good .,4
"After using the 3830 extensively, got this. The usual HP issues with the cartidges being short on ink and running out just when you need them the most is present in this as well. What peeved me the most was the intermittent and unreliable printing over direct Wi-Fi or over the home network. Perhaps it's my printer, or something else.

Why buy this? Document feeder for scanner. If you need to scan multiple pages, the document feeder is valuable feature.
Also, re-filled cartidges can be used if needed. Don't go with the rated prints, you'll get about 150-200 B&W pages on the regular 640 cartridge and 120-130 pages on the color.",4
"Good product.print quality very attractive.Scan quality also good.
This is not a wireless printer keep it mind.otherwise good product it is.",4
some times it does record the steps for whole day.,4
Easy to install..able to levarage internet speed..coverage wise good..but still inside flat you need to put in strategic spot,4
Cheap and works smooth,4
I have been using this earphone for more than a year now.This is me second purchase I ordered it to gift it to my mother...The sound quality is quite good and it also cancels out the noise....apart from this it is available at a very reasonable price and comes in good packaging,4
Nice router,4
battery ok but mobile found to be heavy,4
"I liked the product.... there was damage in the packing but the band is proper. overall the quality is good, useful for me",4
Print quality is very good,4
"I m giving it on outlook basis , however I m not at all satisfied with battery backups . This product doesn't meet my expectations and hence I returned it .",4
The phone is truely amazing. It's look is mindblowing i have it's sea blue colour which really looks owsme. The only problem with the phone is there is no any back cover with it......,4
Overall it's good except the fitting,4
its a value for money ear phone with good sound quality.,4
"Great product but value is little bit High. Tether application is very useful for control this device.
If you want long rage network ( next 2 room) you have to select on 2.5ghz network and for high speed select 5ghz( limited device support) network.",4
Touch screen seems good & accuracy of result not up to mark as compared to medical devices. Else pedometer and other activities may be accurate.,4
"Good product more or less, to note that not so different performance from other machines",4
Best product best sound quality and it has best bass it's really value for money...,4
It's working good,4
Volume goes to very loud,4
BASS AND SOUND QUALITY IS BEST. BUT MORE LOUDER TO HEAR SONG THE SOUND IS HEARED BY SOMEONE.,4
"All features are OK
But for product you are shown black belt with unit however I have received red and purple colour best. which dosent look good with unit.

Please arrange for black belt as shown in your product presentation.

Picture quality,4
It is amazing,4
So far so good. Router is working fine till now. I recommended this router to other people. Signals of both bands are good,4
Nice for personal residential usage. Range covers all rooms.(In 3 BHK). Download is also uninterrupted.Overall good modem with wide coverage. Recommended for personal users.,4
"Router is really good covers G+1 floor easily with good speed and coverage.
USB port is DISABLED please watch out guys",4
Phone printing is much more good,4
"The Bluetooth connection of the headphones was overall good, but once in a while I noticed it randomly got disconnected, but nothing serious. The range was told was 10m. I found the 8 hour battery life to be true. One thing I noticed was the mic volume was a little low, but to be fair these are not made for calls. Overall I am happy with the performance of the headphones.",4
Working in full capacity 5 ghz. Connected 5 devices still can able to get 145mbps. Great product.,4
"Great product, should come with speakers as well",4
"Step count accurate & heartbeat working nice, overall good watch in this price range",4
Cover for Protect for power bank.Good power bank,4
"The bass as mentioned is not that great, there is more trebble along with the bass and it is like a drum disc sound.",4
It's working gud,4
"Stap is totally fine and it is more comfortable and product is totally fine if you need everything in a record we have to connect always with Bluetooth only
Mi fit app is working in a perfect manner",4
Camera is decent buy at this price. The picture quality is also satisfying.,4
Worth for price but camera quality ok,4
I think it's okay,4
Over all good in this price,4
Good. working Fine from last one year,4
Good.... Product but the colour given with that printer got used very fast....,4
It‚Äôs a good pair of ear phones due to the sound quality. It‚Äôs on par with more expensive earphones but the Great Indian Sale discount made it even better. The Packaging & delivery were excellent. The only small negative might be that the wire is not entirely tangle proof.,4
Mind blowing purchase.Invoice not download,4
"sound is overall very good.the punchyness is there,treble is there, but the bass is little less when we compare it with its competetors like mi dual drivers,even mi basic earphones, and i felt little extra treble while listening any kind of music through it.
THIS IS VERY GOOD ONE TO BUY GIVES VERY GOOD SOUND DETAILED CLEAR CRISPER MUSIC.",4
Good mobile phone in this price. Camera quality were expected some more clearity. Rear body finishing is attractive. light weight.Happy till now.,4
Top battery life,4
"This phone is good, its look is the best looking and the front camera of this phone is very special, the rear camera which is 48 mega pixels, the camera is a bit too fine, it is not very special and the functions of it are fast. And the storage memory card of the phone is not full 64 GB and the storage is 51 GB
, according to me, this phone is a bit right, it is a bit expensive at 11000, after seeing everything according to the phone, ‚Çπ 11000 is too much.",4
It is a nice phone.battery performance is nice....but display touch is a little poor.....I loved the look of phone ...but while using snapchat and changing the filters the screen does not changes fully ...I mean there are places where the phone can't edit....properly....although there is a little problem in display,4
"The 5.1 system is small in size but packs a punch. I use it for my guitar sound monitoring, the mixer aux output is given to the speakers through its aux ports. The sound is like any other 40 W speak without distortion, it picks up the bass of the 6E string very nicely and the satellite speakers respond to the other strings well.
The cables provided are of poor quality and I needed a separate set. The front AUX is iffy. Here are the pros and cons :

Pros
1. Great price for a 5.1
2. Plays with an audio mixer easily
3. The woofer is particularly good
4. The AUX port on the front is a good option

Cons
1. Never tried it with a television, though have no doubt it will work
2. AUX jack in the front gives iffy sound, I know cause I returned the first piece to get the second one.
3. The description is too elaborate and reality different",4
It's a very good product with minimum bezels and a 1080p brightness intelligent display. The low blue light mode works really fine. The User interface of the screen is obsolete. Don't expect built-in speakers to deliver an output of even 1W.,4
"Wifi signals are very strong
You should buy this wifi router
And very easy to install",4
No hdmi cable included.. otherwise I will rate 5,4
It's good for this price,4
I am writing after used of 15 days mobile are very nice only one thing missing is no notification light given.other wise battery camera touch are superb,4
I like this product.i use for daily health tracking and to check notifications while i am riding .,4
Camera very good,4
I think I'm expecting real Sony effect,4
Product fine but there are some questions regarding accuracy,4
Bass is really fascinating,4
It‚Äôs a good router and has a wide range.,4
"Jbl c100SI is a beautiful earphone for daily usage . The bass is pretty good but not the best the audio clarity is clear , it comes with one button in the microphone . Its not that great as the senhenizer in terms of audio quality . But when it comes to built quality jbl is better than the senhenizer. Overall for jbl is a good inearphone for the price of 600 rs with mic is a good deal. 1 day delivery that's amazing good work üíØ",4
"The sound coming from the product is not so high. But the earphones is very well blocking the ears so that we cannot hear any sojnd from the outside world. We will be having many different other products at the same price range. So I dont suggest you all to buy this productfor sure. But I can say you will not be disappointed with this one.

Also quick delivery for this product from amazon... Kudos to that...",4

"Bluetooth.Have been using this one for a week now and extremely happy with i have got
Some of the outstanding features that i found
- high bass
- crisp audio quality
- the product runs for 10+ hours easily on 1 charge
- the charging time is roughly 2 hours
- also the bluetooth here is 5.0 which enables connection in less than 5 seconds
- also it has aux cable which converts the product to wired headphone in case one doesnt want to use bluetooth
- the product is compact and easy to carry as well",4
This is Fantastic.,4
Best phone for my experience but delivery is not good ...,4
"One issue here is that it can't be used for more than 1 or 2 hour its cushions hurt your ears gets sweaty.Durability amazing plus good sound quality, bass is as according to price if u want more than u have to increase your budget at this this price it's great compare to other like sony headphones plus it got metal bend so protected from chances of breaking",4

Its good mobile in this budget,4
"Budget phone for day to day use.
Overall camera quality is average. Look and feel is good.",4
"Simple, sleek and serves purpose. Easy to install. Occupies very less space.",4
I have been using this product from last 3 months. Everything is good. I'm using this for my fitness tracker. Heartbeat is not much accurate. Remaining all are good but not perfect. Need more development.,4
Product is great but if it would be a 15.6 inch in size then it would be greatest ..,4
heavy bass lovers it's not meant for you,4
"Just simply Super, equal to Apple Watch. Nice look, nice design and nice style, good features. Thanks to Amazfit and Amazon.",4
Working fine...,4
"Sleep tracking I have not checked yet
Accuracy is good
Touch is also satisfactory",4
Nice product..,4
"Overall I think it is a good product and at right price after the discount..
Good sound quality...
The wires are like any other ear phone which would cost about 200-300. This compromise the durability of the product",4
For the price it's good... But the detection is very basic..... Very much variable on the accuracy... But... If u r going for a smart band for first time and just started excersizing and recording health habits this is an entry level band... But if u have been a pro in keeping yourself healthy and doing it since an yr or two this is a low level product.... But for beginners it's perfect instead of going for a pricy smart band unless u know u gonna use it and get the feel for a smart band....... I give it a solid 7/10,4
"Bass is not effective!
If u want value for money its good,sound is good but u won't feel the magic if turn the vol to max!",4
Bset,4
"Good in built quality ,. Camera is very good in day light but in night it goes very bad. Selfie camera is very bad in both day and night ,it produce warm pics just like red it make me sad. Performance is quiet good. Xiaomi has to improve camera just like note 7 pro.",4

"Damn it! I did the mistake again, this is a wifi extender. Not a router + modem. I think I did spend a lot of time reading specifications and tech knowledge is above average. Bad product descriptions.",4
Excellent monitor at this price range .display is really nice and the colors are all really vibrant,4
This is good for first time user. Latest Android. In this price range this is okay product,4
Product quality and sound are all perfect but the packaging box is very worst in condition,4

Quality - 10 / 9.5

I love this product , but sometimes it's battery backup is to low",4
"You have mentioned Total product weight : 06 kg 700 gram
But actual product weight with Box packing 5 kg",4
sound quality and build quality is good,4
It's hard to say when it works and when it doesn't.,4
"This product is simply amazing. East to install interface is quite easy and simple and signal gives full network with good internet speed of broadband making it worth. I have personally checked two laptop, 5phones connected everytime, speed is always perfect with no lag.",4
Value for money but could be more worth if back cover & tempered class are provided with the phone,4
this is a very good product and it does what it promise to do. very convenient and hassle free power back up.,4
Product as expected,4
could be more clear with treble,4
Quality sound,4
U can have better option in this price range,4
Awesome product!,4
"Nice product, printing quality is good, takes time for installation.",4
"Great product for the price. Not in ear so sound is a bit low but i am not complaining. For those like me who hate in ear headphones this is a blessing to avoid the inconvenience.
Good finish and snug fitting. Does not come out of ear easily so thats a good thing.",4
Good product with legible price. The mobile app is great. The problem is the charger that doesn't let the fitness tracker to sit in it. It would be great if the charger is replaced with better design.,4
"SPO2, Sleep Tracking is not so correct all the time.",4
"Not much difference from TN panel in terms of colour n viewing angle. The speakers are of no use.

Best available band till now in this price range
If you can add more money go for amazfit or any other fitness watches becz this band has small display
If you plan to buy it then buy Iloft screen gaurd too its very necessary for this band",4
Wiring not satisfied,4
I hv purchased this 2 times bcuz this is the best headphone under 800.. go for it or you will sure regret for this oneüòÇ,4
Front camera is too bad,4
signal strength is good,4
This is my first dslr ...was very excited and I am happy with quality of photos I have clicked till now..good for beginners as price is nt too high..,4
Overall Product looks good. Definitely value for money. Build quality is good. May be battery life if become predictable it will be good.,4
The range is low compared to the old one I was using,4
"M 42 is a beast phone at 21k but the screen quality is HD+, not FHD nor FHD+ I don't know why they opted for HD+ with an Amoled screen.
And at that range, 64MP or 108MP is mandatory by other manufacturers but Samsung is going with 48MP but its True 48MP not like other manufacturers have mode to opt for 64 or 108 MP pictures.

See this phone is incredible but two things I didn't like because they didn't opt for FHD+ resolution or screen and a Camera module like 64/108 MP other than this.. I am happy with this phone.",4
"Volume is low compared to Sennheiser and other in-ear phones, Bass is good.

Not suitable for calls / meeting because of eco while you speak, this could be due to fully enclosed ear tips.

Over all good for listening just songs.",4
Popular brand,4
"If you are a regular user of headphones/ earphones and buys them periodically as they get damaged/lost, then this is the right headphone for you. I would have to start with the feature of both wireless and wire function while using it. Both are great, especially when the battery is down, you have the option for hearing it with the wire (AUX Cable).
The audio clarity is really impressive and also the Bluetooth proximity is better when compared to other headphones. It is a good product at its best prize.",4
"I bought this device for 999/- during the festive sale, it has been performing well & has a very good MIMO functionality if you have good internet bandwidth. It works well between different devices connected to the router For E.g Mobile video call, Laptop & T.V Youtube watching etc can work simultaneously. Although i would not have the same view with regards to the large antennas provided, i would call them quiet reasonable when it comes to covering large areas. The router on the other hand can handle loads & the vendor also provides firmware updates regularly which sometimes take place on the background & the router blinks slowly when its started in the morning. All in All the router is definitely worth the buy for the price.",4
"This watch is pretty good , awesome item.. I am impress from it but there was one issue with it that some time it is disconnected by mobile phone... Go for it. Got this item as reasonable price. Its touch screen watch , connect by smart phone.",4
Worth for money...,4
Good one to go for a budget smartwatch. If the screen was amoled it would have been a fantastic smartwach,4
"The headphones as a whole were very nice and comfortable and the additional 3.5 mm to DJ jack made it easier to save the already huge battery life. The headphones were working pretty well with the wire, but when I started using them on bluetooth more I started to realize that the sound quality was dropping and there was a lot of distortion, a few minutes into a wireless session of usage. Other than that I had no issues with the headphones.",4
ok on this budget,4
Its pretty good but I felt de previous dlink I used wid double antennae was much better but then it was 500 bucks costlier than this.. So yea worth de price,4
Met my expectations!,4
"This watch is good, my main use is for call alter and music control , which is working fine.
But other option I didn't explore more.
The watch looks like i-watch",4
"‚Ä¢Amoled display looks good .
‚Ä¢Get more accurate results .
‚Ä¢Better charging Socket.
‚Ä¢Comfortable in Hands.
‚Ä¢Good built quality.
But
‚Ä¢calorie count.- Once you start any exercise it always count calories whether you do it or not.
Otherwise overall good.
In terms of calorie count it lacks",4

Considering the price this is the best watch esp I'm impressed withe battery life....,4
"Good one. Only problem that I am facing refresh is slow , lines appear in screen while moving applications across screens.",4
Camera (rare&front) performance poor.overall phone was good.,4
Heart rate and other monitoring features shows the accurate results.,4
Camera quality needs a great increment,4
I really like the look of watch and it's colors. Overall good performance and good battery life of watch. Really appreciate if more watch faces will come on noise cloud app.,4
cost worthy,4
Nice mobile. thanks to Amazon,4
"Sound, bass, noise cancellation, fit and everything else is just good. Plus it's got a mic. It's better than the others available for the similar price range. Got it for 549
Edit: The right one stopped working after a few months of using them.",4
Product is good,4
The colours are accurate and so mesmerising best gaming monitor for this price,4
"Everything is good, but this device is having one cons that it doens't have fingerprint sensor. Please don't buy this product if you're searching for fingerprint also.",4
Working fine. But range is lesser than expected,4
No bass knob. Everything else is good,4
Its perfect but for just in Black colour it's pixel are visible if you're watching from close distancing,4
Every thing ok but its lil bit heavy and looks big on head sound quality is okay not good to hang in neck you can't move your head freely,4
Fingerprint reader could be in any other place rather than power button.,4
"Stand is awesome.
Contrast is natural.
Colors are pure except for the yellow tint allover which is expected these days due to eye care certification
( R 92, G 93, B 100 in custom color removed that tint for me).
Do install ' DEll display manger ' software for easier switching of modes.",4
Beautiful and attractive design. Sound is awesome with a wonderful balance of treble and bass. A bit higher bass which I loved a lot. Noise cancellation also works well. Comfortable on wearing. Loved the product. ‚ù§Ô∏è,4
Sound and bass best he,4
"Pros:
Excellent Panel.
Accurate and vibrant colors.
Can get really bright.
Good Black levels.
The stand provided is really nice.

Cons:

Wobbles a bit if the surface shakes.
Price is slightly on the higher side for the the features.

One would atleast expect a USB C at this price point bit it doesn't have one. It's available in UL850 which is 10k more than this model.

Irrespective of what the description shows, it DOESN NOT have a USC C port. I was aware of it before buying but the images are a bit misleading.",4
it has 4 antena but the range of the wifi is not good,4
Value for money.. and also sleep tracking is ok touch screen response is also good overall a very good experience.,4
Good one.... i gifted it to my brother for his online class he is very happy now,4
"Many a times delay is there in call notification.... And gets vibrating after receiving or hanging up the call

Alarm time could not be set from watch only

Some issues with app also... A bit slow",4
"Normally it is ok, but the USB cable is loose, very loose and I had to attach it with a cellotape",4
"Its my 3rd headfone by Boat,Ordered it for my partner and she likes it.
Sound quality is good as per price range.",4
Good product....Initially looks good ! But can ask me after 6 months ! Will apreciate if SNAPDEAL can arrange for the testing strips at discount !Anyways thank you si  read more,4
I've been using this monitor for 2 years now and I've repaired it recently (changed the panel) because line appeared. I'm a person who care about my pc and even my monitor failed.At present after changing the panel my monitor has screen bleeding which dissappears after10s after boot. I'll recommend not to buy this and GO buy a premium one If you need to last your monitor for more than 5 years,4
Sound is good,4
Just purchased from offline store @ 6500 amazon asking much money for this product..well apart from price speakers are too good with clear sound and bass..just one thing it doesnt have more treble ...dats y given 4 stars,4
Battery life is good finger print is decent but camera quality must be more good,4
Yes using this product and experience is Good,4
"I bought two earphones one year earlier and now ,huge difference wires are very thin in the latest one , earlier were good ...Not expected this from Boat",4
Good ‡§´‡•ã‡§®,4
If you are expecting great performance and signal then you should probably have to install repeaters at multiple points at your place. This is a decent router for a small home or office at a reasonable price with a good performance.,4
"very nice i am loving great price, but delivery was a bit slow",4
"Everything is owsme. Bt now I faced a problem. yesterday I travelled through a bike,suddenly starte raining.at tht time I used earphone. N then the earphone is not work properly.. So, can you provide me some services... To work it properly.",4
"Over all good product, result ony use to be reference point of view",4
I liked this product. It is very useful for fitness.,4
"No accuracy while exercising,not showing exact calorie burn and sleep tracking is also not upto the mark as If Iam lying down in night and not sleeping for an hour This band will see it as iam sleeping.
Overall Its a good band but 2000 rs will be a good price to buy 300 rs is just profit.",4
"This is my first camera, very handy. Overall body quality is awesome. If you want good quality photos go for 50mm lens as well.",4
"Everything is good within the price, except response time. Takes 40 sec -1 min to connect to HDMI with the mac pro.",4
Great product but though it is known as basshead but very little bass.And a little amount of noise isolation.,4
These Headphones are just on the Mark they are no where close to Senhiesser. Well just good enough for daily listening and a lil bulky but fits well and sounds well.... although missing some highs at low levels,4
"Really price worth, noise is really a good brand, I really recommended because the item is really a pro looks like apple Smart watches",4
"It's easy to set-up, hassle-free and works efficiently. Is a bit ugly to look at, but the build quality is good.",4
I bought it for 3499 and it‚Äôs a value for money product.,4
Signal is just okay,4
Nice product in this range. Works well and looks good as well.,4
Good camera for bignner.,4
"Overall good sound ,bass quality but I think it could be better .after an hour ear gets pain.and after a month use far- far sound comes out from left ear cup when I increase the volume.",4
The product looks awesome and easy to set up.. works good even when several devices connected. Interface is also nice but it is better only for home use due the strength of range.,4
"Best smart watch for this price. Not very complicated. Just best for app notification, time, sleep tracker. Alarms.",4
A very good purchase... am loving it.... with amazon's delivery speed i loved it even more,4
Using it from last week it is awesome and the custom watch face update is also working properly,4
"The alert of calendar, call and msg help me to be updated.",4

Good product and is comfortable enough to use for a long time. Really nice product,4
"Alternately from the house of JBL so it has the DNA of good music for ears, I'm very much satisfied with the earphone. Build quality is good (missign flat cable). I recommed this product to users looking for wired earphone in 500INR budget.",4
"Good during day time, but image quality is poor at night view, and shutter speed issue comes often. Good product!!",4
Dell Laptop Batteery.I'm satisfied with the product. Thanks to snapdeal! The price of the product was reasonable whereas I have checked in the local market and the rate is too high there. I have received the product with in 3 days after ordering the same.,4
"Very robust product. Just plug it and forget it. Connectivity is very good between adjacent rooms. Browse internet from Multiple devices.
Its value for money.",4
Good for single user pc,4
Good but late delivery.Please delivery in proper time,4
Auto focus takes too much time and noise,4
"It is an awesome router! Has a very good range and provides high speed data transmission. Had trouble setting up the USB thing but the dlink support team was very helpful and guided me through the process. (For any of you having similar troubles, you have to enable SMB sharing in the settings, use a pen drive/hdd in NTFS format. Then use ES file explorer or a similar app to access/stream content wirelessly.)",4
"Liked this smart watch ... if someone looking below 5000 .. this is worth buying it . .
Lot of features in it ... exploring all of them .. tried few features like o2 level check ... heart rate and foot steps and cycling stats are accurate ..",4
Speed is good but the range could have been better,4
I like it üòç,4
Purchased this product this May (2020) and I have noticed that the left side of the headphone does not work anymore.I can only hear audio from the right side.Please replace or repair the product as it is in the warranty period.,4
The range of router is not as expected but 2.4G bandwidth range is much better than the 5G(although expected 5G range is much less ) . Speed is very good and with in 48hrs of usage I didn't faced any stability issues . I also dint see any eating issues mentioned by some users.,4
"Amazon shows 4 cables in the picture but box comes with only 3. I raised a case with Resonate to check the same and also confirm if the product is genuine.

THey confirmed that they supply only 3 cables and yes the product is resonate branded one.",4
Leather is not moulded properly,4
"This is a very good laptop,it's light weight,doesn't hang in betwee like our older laptop,it's good for gaming and fortnite works just fine on it.I would highly recommend this laptop,and its value for money.",4
Good product at a good cost. Ki No issues at all.,4
Some one has used the wifi already with there name and password protected is there.. so kindly refund the sealed one .,4
Amazing product for a beginner as it does almost everything that an expensive smart watch would with being pocket friendly. It's really a great watch ...apart from being accurate and awesome battery life.... It also looks great. People actually come n ask about it because looks great n pricier than it is.,4
It is a very good WiFi router for its price and it is incredibly small. It fits any corner very easily. And also offers good range!,4
"good product ,economical,sound nice ,made in india products must buy for sound lovers, easy to install thanks amazon good like it",4
Print quality good.,4
Good and essay to use.,4
"Everything is good...
Except Made in china
No auto rotary options
No Humonide detection, follow,capture images and record videos...
U can't download detection from camera, only u can view...
U need lot & lots to improve....
Srihome SH025 is far better than this one & also price is less comparatively then To C200",4
Product is good. But it's charger is very loose. Band doesn't fit into charger. I get it charged by using rubber band. Charger is poor which makes it negative point of mi band 4,4
"Great fit, but not exactly accurate.",4
Good product on this range,4
"Decent earphone at this price range. Good sound quality,Bass Quality and wire material is pretty great and tangle free. Noise Cancellation is not so great. If your range is within 500 you can go for it. Thank You.",4

Average Performance,4

Good and useful product. Very comfortable. Almost accurate üíì rate and other functions.,4
"good product. got it in a deal for prime members and can say that it worth the money i paid for it.

Satisfactory product.",4

But a Major Drawback is that this will not support fiber optics.",4
"Product boAt rockerz 450

Pro: 1. Good sound quality 2. Easy connectivity with iOS and Andriod. 3. Good battery backup 4. Mat finish look 5. You can enjoy Movie and songs both.

Con : i would say there is no doubt the product is good, so still now I didn‚Äôt find any flaw.

Thank you amazon and boAt.",4
Not at all good. Very bad,4
"I purchased in oct 2029 and in May 2021 it's getting restarted frequently and not getting connected to my phone also.
I don't tried after reseting the watch and reinstalling the mobile app still the issue iss not solved. I am not able to use the watch.",4
Hangs a bit! Better go for VIVO or OPPO sets. They are best!!,4
Only 15 prints printed and cartridge is empty,4
Super good packing and awesome product,4
"The right one stopped working after 6 months of use, then sony replaced it with new one. Still love it",4
Camera quality could have been better. Phone weight is little on the heavier side. Charger cable could have been provided with additional length. Overall a best bet for the price range.,4
Entry level phone. Works quite okay. Good for beginners and doe the job. A true value for money,4
Crisp video. Sharpness and contrast is nice. Color creation could have been better. Good for normal photo and video editing but not so for gaming. Audio is pretty average. Ergonomic design and build quality is fine. Controlls are well defined but have no toggle switch. No true HDR though picture quality is fairly appreciable.,4
"One of the best fitness band.
First of all it gives you one of the best accuracy.
There are best watch faces and main thing it is much lighter so it won't bother you during your exercise.
If you want a fitness band you should go for it.",4
"Great product, battery maybe not as advertised, need to keep a check",4
"Initial impression :
The speaker is stylish and has good features. I connected it with my LED tv and it works good as my tv has equalizer function as this speaker has no bass knob.
Overall the sound output and bass is good for its price(I got it for ‚Çπ2000)",4
I liked this product Before this product I have used tenda product quite easy to set up and use only Tenda provides manual paper which doesn't contain pwd searched on net. Otherwise awsooome produt.,4
All good so far. Shipment was fast and all health readings are fairly accurate so far. Particularly interested in real time heart rate monitoring which I'll observe for a few days and update.,4
"Nice product , something delay in light",4
Good product.Nice experiance,4
Rear camera picture quality is not good,4
"Performance is decent. Battery life is very good.
Camera could have been better.",4
"Bought it before 20days and everything good.The only issue with this is touch accuracy is some what low.Need to improve on it.the other things are okay,value for money.",4
Very very good some what poor.... distance,4
at this price segment we could not expect more good features good battery camera is not good display very dull,4
"Worth of money ,high configuration good one.",4
Heavy Price,4
üëçüèª,4
Good for long hours because of maat look and adjustable colors.,4
"For almost a year, I been using TP link at home but it got scewed in a thunderstorm so I had to get a new one. Since I was content with tp link, I decided to stick with the same brand and bought it from amazon. To my experience, I found the modem reliable and effective like the previous one. Wifi range within my 3000 sqft home is strong and constant. I even get decent wifi range into my outhouse, backyard and lawn. So signal strength is quite strong for a huge area. Delivery was on time, packing was very much decent as well. I have been using this recently purchased modem for approximately 3 months and touchwood nothing to complain..",4
I liked the look and functions too.,4
"Nice product, Super Bass awesome...",4
Display camera quality is very badd ..quality is üëÅÔ∏è,4
"Headphones sound music bass is class . Now only thing is that i want JBL focus is 2 improve wire quality like Realme bud 2.
Thank you JBL & Amazon",4
"In this price, this is perfect smartphone for a beginner or senior citizens.
**Camera quality is not good as expected. Basic front camera. Rear camera is ok.
**No fingerprint scanner, but thank god Face unlock is there.
****Good thing is display size and quality.üëç",4
Sound quality is superb nd bass is also üëç.,4
Good quality phone... but heavy weight... and everything is okkk...,4
Everything is ok but call silent features are not available... that is very disappointed.,4
"I only like JBL thats why I return to this brand again after using various Earphones like Skullcandy, Boat. Skullcandy is seems to be like JBL but not JBL. So anyone can buy this product due to its superior quality.",4
Sound super bluetooth super bass scooper,4
Good quality phone at this price..camera quality could be improved,4
Cool Gadget with nice face images and almost accurate features.,4
"Accuracy is good touch response is also good, just need to improve in battery life. Otherwise rest things are good.",4
"Very good product. Ergonomic design. Very good warrenty policy after 7 months of usage one side was not working, boat replaced new headset. Best after sales service ever",4
Peoduct is good but not able to register 1 year guarantee as product code is not available on box under QR code.,4
"These valued speakers are very bang for buck they sound average with most of it taking the bass.
The satellites are a bit non-effective as you can't tell that they are working may be its the content.
They don't have a hole on back to hang them to nail on walls so stuck placing all them side by side infront of me
the sub woofer takes most of content and the satellites just enhance it .
remote control is good. one bad thing is we have to turn on the speakers every time it is switched on with remote or buttons on it to use it.",4
So far ... experience is good. Let's see after using some .. how the mobile processor behaves,4
Good sound quality and bass.,4
Feedback.Sound quality is like local made earphones not worth full brand to buy,4
The Bluetooth connectivity is a problem for me always it is disconnecting..may be even more battery backup also,4
It is a good and easy to use printer ink cartridges are easily refillable.,4
"It's nice band , using since a month battery life is good almost 25-27 days , accuracy should be improved but overall it's good",4
Good product.ok as an replacement. average back up of 1 hour. original battery that comes along new laptop also back up for 2 hrs so this is ok as an replacament,4
Best to another...in this time,4
"Accuracy is good,
But there are some music control issues,
And I found drastic battery drain even after turning off some features",4
It is really a worth one,4
Easy to use and connect with phone battery is too good It runs almost 20-25 days,4
"Boats is the best. Budget able prices and good quality products.
In this price you won't get such a good headphone.",4
Nice product with good battery life and value for money,4
Niece. Good battery backup.,4
Sometimes it hanged while multi tasking.,4
"GOOD ...SO FAR OK.

THAN YOU.",4
No bass controll nor treble. Good sound quality. But a bit costly for 2.1 speakers,4
"I bought this on the launch date. The app and connectivity was pathetic and i reviewed that as first comment but seller blocked my comment.(thumbs down to that).
Now app improved and performing good. Nice product to the price. Vibration is loud. Display is good. Battery life 3days max with auto heart rate on.

Overall good.",4
"It's a perfact for women, looking good and user friendly. Display size perfect, primium look,light waight, all functions are useful.",4
"I ordered them in taffy pink colour and they are pretty pink .
The sound quality is good as they are on the ear headphone they cancel outer noise quite well.

But I found them quite annoying while putting them in my ears.
As they slip often",4
Great product.enjoy using it.good battery life .water proof .easy to use with android mobile app.go for it.heart beat monitoring quite accurate,4
Just got it like the build quality. Will revert with my feedback later.,4
In this of price range the product is very good I m giving 4 star for this product and it's battery life is awesome,4
Budget phone . For 6800 rs - massive 5000mah battery and 6.5 inch display,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Very useful band u can monitor heart rate, footsteps tracking, weather and notification on band only...and its app is very useful and veru user-friendly
And battery life is superb i ve used it continuously after charging 100% and it last almost 8-10 with all the options enabled
Summary: go buy it...worth every penny",4
"Didn't expect such a great product at such a low price,especially from a big brand like Sony. The sound quality is good, the headphones are comfortable, the cable quality is top notch. The build could have been better. The head band can feel a little bit uncomfortable at times. But overall it's a really good product.",4
USB is loose...It is not connecting properly,4
"Simple superb quality, working well, looking good",4
"It is working with any hassle
Fantastic at this price.
I bought it 3/4mnths back.",4
"Belt is not a good quality, display glass isnt a glass its a plastic which is not scratch resistant either.",4
Good fingerprint and good battery life and good camera,4
"Touch delay sometimes only .
Battery life is good .
Connectivity is so easy.
Free size .",4
Not product at this price. Bass sound tunes everything was good and still. You can surely go for it in this range.,4
Osm product.Bild qwallity is not good.. wight is good ..i gave 3.5  star,4
"Best in the segment like user interface, band connectivity, features.
Best thing that i like in this band 5 is magnetic charge, so no need to detach from band to charge.",4
"timely delivered
nice product
look is also good, sound also, comfortable, soft ear pads

only want to know, volume button will work only with SD card? as its not working during bluetooth or using AUX

MIC also need to test",4
App and the band are very good. But the charger is not keeping the band in position for charging and ejecting it out. May be a bad design. Charge the band by tying it with a rubber band. Jugaad.,4
As to by me t an executive that sleep montering and wall paper screen with other small functions,4
"Looks good and stylish at home...
Easy to install and use..
Wifi signal is good even at the corner of house
best for the small house 1bhk or upto 500sq ft",4
I like it because very easy to use,4
"Good product in this range. Impressive sound quality and bass combination. good for regular use. Don‚Äôt expect premium quality in this budget.
Very much Recommended.",4
Sound quality is good. But wire thickness is very less.. Have doubt on durability,4
"Four Stars.Best quality of wire, Good sound go for it, But when we put it in ears little more slippery but sond quality is good with 1 year warranty, but i dont  read more",4
On this6799 price it is good,4
Good one!!,4
"I purchased this on lightning deal of 370 rupees, it's been a month, i dont ancounter any problem yet,i use it for watching live classes, and for music, also 1 year warranty card you get along with so perfect deal:)",4
ITS NICE. ENJOYING IT'S POWERFUL AND PLEASANT EFFECT WITH UTMOST SATISFACTION.,4
Good phone in low cost. Good battery. Good camera. But more weight.,4
This moblie is very best Phone in samsung smart battery is full powerful one time charging 24h used.,4
"Value for money in terms of steps, distance covered, workouts. But while tracking sleep, it counts hours in bed as sleep even when you're awake. Otherwise perfect. W
While driving you have to activate driving mode on app or else it'll be counted as steps.",4
Good product for budget,4
"Personal use
Camara must improve",4
Good brand,4
"I ordered this for my mother, nd when dhe received this she's was verry happy...approx 2 3 months had completed to used it...verry good sound nd every thing is perfect...in this price range perfect for a normal call lover",4
Good Head set.... value for money,4
Good sound. For a room sound is enough. Get in Rs3799 during deal,4
"A very VFM product that you can buy in this range. I like the details that are plotted on to the charts on the app. Especially with sleep tracking, giving the details about sleep quality and the start and stop time as well.

The accuracy of this data is quite good too. I used to use another activity tracker prior to this and the step could calculation is much more streamlined on Noise compared to the other.

Touch screen response is okay. Would have certainly loved if the touch screen responded to sweaty fingers too. If you are working out or jogging, it won't recognise your touch if the fingers are wet.

Battery back up is good as well. This review is based on my 5 months of usage.",4
All working fine as per description and good for the price,4
The phone is good for its price. It's a bit slow .Don't buy it if you are opting to buy for playing games.I brought it for my mom and she doesn't hav much usage except camera and whatsapp so it's a good deal.!,4
Better performance.,4
Very useful gifted for my hubby .,4
best router,4
"Good product. You can use it round the clock. Very stable connection. A bit difficult to install, but it has a good installation guide.",4
"Amazon delivery is amazing.....
Camara is good
Performance is good
Display is average
Battery is good",4
Nice product sleep tracking accuracy is very good,4
"Got on time, functions are easy to operate, good to monitor health with all features like spo2, HR and BP.",4
"Got this phone for my grandparents, i was able to get a good deal on it.
The phone has a nice big screen, display is average quality,
definitly good for media consumption,
the ui is clear, MIUI is easy to use.
The camera is poor though
but if 10K is the budget, this is a go to phone, hands-down.
Definitly a good buy!!!!",4
Display and battery backup is good compare to other smart bands. Need to improve the accuracy of fitness tracking only.,4
"Great camera although slow focus, macro incapable. Good quality.",4
"Really good DSLR for beginners
Only downside is the Canon app which doesn't help in transferring videos wirelessly",4
I compared with honor band 5. It is less accurate in every department than honor. Even if you turn off heart rate monitoring it will still monitor heart rate (green light). Those software based features like stress are of no use. Only battery life and customisation of watch faces is better than honor. Else for accuracy honor band 5 is still better and cheaper.,4
Value for money. Better than TP link router. Wifi signal is good for 1200 sq ft house. Connects multiple devices well.,4
"I am not going to say that this is the best one, it has some issues like light bleeding but compared with price it is acceptable cause I got it at a steal deal of 7499 Rs. only.",4
"Best xiaomi mi band 5 is best its look is premium and the starp is very soft but some features like spo2, nfc , and voice assistant was Missing that was in the Chinese and global version why mi you not provide them in the indian version highly disappointed about it",4
Nice sound but when you talk over the bluetooth there is an echo sound..,4
Good for multimedia,4
I M yet usu g it sparingly ButI mosthope is maintenance free performance and realizing printing cost per page as mentioned,4
Nice product but not worth the money.,4
This is the best there is under 700. But compared to higher priced models like e10/ senheiser jbl looses out,4

"Installation, done by my vendor. Can't comment on that. Didn't not call up tech support, so don't know about that. Router is good, getting 5G connection and it shows the speed correctly",4
Best camera for beginner in this budget range.,4
"Very good for beginners(who haven't used Sennheiser, bose & other good brands)",4
It's just ok if u r on a budget. No problem as such bt still cld have been a bit better performance overall. Still worth d cost though.,4
Bass is good.,4
"Good Product
Fairly reasonable price
Awesome display in house (yet to check outside)
Easy to use interface
Good strap band
Easy to connect with App
Really light weight
Weather, world clock, Blood Oxygen, alarm, watch face etc many useful features. Plus improved sleep monitoring, stress, activity tracker, women health, etc good addition at this price range.
Now to check how it stsnds in battery life and day to day use before giving any final verdict.",4
"Created a slight issue while inserting in my lenovo K6 for the first time. However, it is workig better now. Quality and clarity of the sound is really good and the built quality is also beyond compare.",4
I have been using this router for past 2 months. No issues so far. But i would suggest to go for a D-Link router of similar specs. This is because Wi-Fi coverage area of the D-Link router is better than that of Tp-Link router ( I have tested my friend's D-link router in my home.),4
Quality of material is high class. Feels very premium. Easy to connect. And descent sound quality.,4
The screen is prone to scratches very easily. Also sleep tracking is poor. It tracks only your night sleep time that too is not accurate. Rest other features of this watch is good,4
"excellent value for money and performance, very good WiFi range and doesne heat up much as compared to other routers.
setting up had a very user friendly UI
works well as of now but just very skeptical about the customer service and warranty info
overall a good purchase and excellent job by amazon for delivery and packaging",4

Good and cheap product.,4
"Battery life is really nice. Only problem is the app shows distance unit as meter where as in watch it shows miles.. Sometime difficult to track with respect to your target... Also the sleep tracker works fine but not sure about the accuracy... Suggestion to include more watch faces with distance, steps & calorie in place in a single face.",4
This is my first JBL earphone it seems to be good and its sound quality and bass are also amazing. But it doesn't have the volume button this makes me a little upset about that. And it seems a little fragile from the connector side. But overall it's good and the sound quality and noise cancellation are very stunning. That's what we want.,4
Fine deal at this price,4
"Product was working fantastic 1 and half month , but after that the display got deemed i can't see the details .

Please suggest what to do with this now",4
I like it great looking,4
Good sound deliver at such a low cost headphones. Sound clarity is good at even a medium volume range you can easily distinguish the different variants of sound mixer..hats off to jbl..,4
It fine,4
"It's look is very nice and display is quite bright and accuracy is also good, main issue is battery life Bcz I get battery life of around 4 to 5 days. It's good but not up to the mark as claimed by company. If u r ok with 4 to 5 days battery than go and must grab it.",4
Yesterday i received and installed this item. I am very satisfied with this overall performance. The surround speakers cable lengths are 6 meters only which are suitable for 10 x 10 rooms only.,4
Compact and easy to install!,4
üëçNice,4
"Good DSLR to use but buy both lense together because using small lense u can capture shot distance only then camera is got to use but u need to lean the trick to capture good picture

Good DSLR to buy",4
"Good sound for the price, would surely recommend it. Don't know year about the durability. But over all it's a good product with great bass.",4
Good quality.product is good for those who are watching earphones below 500,4
Nice but little something...,4
"Best in budget, battery life is good, screen is good",4
The sound quality of the headphones is good for the price I paid but it doesn't do much for noice cancellation . The bass of the headphones is also pretty nice.,4
Good product nice to use,4
Product is very good but 7 days taken to deliver the same,4
"Almost Same Like Mi Band 4 .
2-3 Features Added .",4
White colour is good. Due to sharp pointed at the end it is not comfortable to insert in the ear. Volume quality is not upto the mark in comparison to other model of same make. For quality audible sound I have to press volume button of my phone beyond permissible limit for an ear phone.,4
"it be useful for health and calls it is good product, use for cost",4
Go for it if you are looking for a lasting product at affordable price. Not a good product it you are looking for quality sound. Noise cancellation is NOT good and also couldnt produce high volume.,4
Looks good value for money can comment after using,4
"In certain part of the house signal is very weak
.",4
"This is Good Headphone as it have good Mic, Sound Clearity......I use it for Office Work and Listening Music, Movies......It is great specially for WFH Peoples now a days for Attending Online Meetings, Kids Classes",4
"IT GIVES A DESCENT SOUND WITH QUITE BIG WOOFER
BUT THE REMOTE QUALITY IS POOR",4
Everything is going good but sharing control is Missing we can't provide control to shared device it's the disappointment. In Mi camera provided this fecility,4
Is working well.,4
"The product is good
I liked the watch design as it is very similiar to apple watch series
The touch sense of the watch could have been improved as well as the watch faces should be made available.
The accuracy of watch is ok,i liked the 35 gms weight, it feels light while doing anything
Great one to buy at 3k to 3.5 k rangeüëçüëçüëç",4
Lacks bass and does not get loud enough sometimes but is clear. I got it for close to 600 after discount with MRP above 1000 INR. Would recommend at discounted price but not at MRP.,4
"I found that the noise cancellation is not that good but the sound quality and its premium build quality is fantastic.
Boat 450 is one of the best Headphones under 1500 :)",4
"Good to work. Height and angle adjustable. Using for graphics, powerpoint etc..
HDMI cable supplied with the monitor is not compatible. Need to purchase one which is compatible.",4
I loved this...but when talking over this...they are not able to listen clearly to our voice...I don't the reason for this...other than this...all good,4
Network connectivity range low then Realme or Oppo Mobile. I don't access internet or any voice call at my room. But Realme service smooth.,4
BUT BLACK QUANTITY IS TOO LOW,4
Very decent headphones for such price. I purchased the same model 2 years back and at that point in time it costed me 1999 bucks! Now it's price dropped and believe me it's a great deal now. Good bass and nice sound quality. Sony knows how to make audio video entertainment products with stylish and working design.,4
Quality products with reasonable price,4
"A little laggy but a very satisfying product for the price range it was in! Helps me track steps and even play music. Recommended if you‚Äôre looking for a good product in an affordable price range!
PS: it lets you add a custom watch face too!",4
Really nice but single channel (2.5Gz),4
Bluetooth and remote quality is best but sound quality is week,4
The product is good but the charger is not good.The device pops out of the charger when its tried to be attached to the charger for charging. Need to work hard for attaching the device to the charger provided in the pack. Other than that the battery is awesome .Even though its mentioned 20 days backup but i got more than a month in 1 full charge.,4
"Pros:
1. Super quick setup.
2. Video Quality is superb, even in low light.
3. Motion detection is perfect.
4. Can view live feed/recording from anywhere.

Cons:
1. Cannot save the video easily on mobile or any other device.
2. No, browser access.
3. Battery backup would have been a plus.",4
BP monitoring mechanism of the product is not so satisfactory. It should monitor automatically like other features such as temperature or HR,4
"Nice Product for price of 2,300/- bass is inbuilt clear voice.. Quick delivery from amazon",4
"Purchased as a replacement to my HP wireless printer which was not economical and need frequent costly cartridge changes even with minimal use and throw up too many errors.

Printer is good, well made and compact enough for home use. the print quality is good, and print speed is also acceptable. Came with 3 bottles of black ink and one bottle of CMY each which should last a long time for normal use.

My printer had Paper jam issues on initial setup itself eventhough there was no paper present. Had to call the service centre who had to openup the entire printer to rectify error in paper sensor. To see a brand new printer all opened up is a bad thing. It works well now. The service guy was prompt though and did warranty repairs",4
"You get really good Features value for money.

Inbuilt Speakers.
Blue eye protection

"Very nice product in this range, no complaints.",4
"SpO2 measurement is a big task. Eight out of ten times you will get measurement problem. Accuracy is not good. Heart rate, steps count is Ok. Battery died on the end of 6th day. Product feel is good. If you are purchasing this for spO2 measurement, you should no,Hope Amazefit will improve on next update.",4

fantastic product with the price of 21 k,4
Handset is good but headphones not provided inside the box,4
Sometimes Bluetooth connectivity was took so long...,4
"Using it for last 1 month and its nice though the range is aout 10m only, recommended for small house upto 3Bhk, though the delivery was very late and lousy, maye as it was festival time, Customer care support is nice. I will recommend Amazon above Flip-kart and snapdeal as far as pricing is concerned.",4
Works well.,4
Keeps a good track of your health parameters and at a very good price.,4
Sound is very smooth,4
Installation is so easy and at this price range it's good.,4
Awesome things...,4
Sony is trusted brand for knowing their quality,4
"Good product, useful.",4
"I've been using amazfit watches for the last 2.5 years, starting with Pace and Verge. Now this GTS 2 mini is a super stripped down version of the GTS2. Following are the pros and cons. I'm not going into the accuracy of the sensors, Amazfit is good in that area.

Pros
1. Vibrant and clear display, obviously its an AMOLED display
2. Super lightweight and very comfortable to wear.
3. Got all the required sensors.
4. Smooth and quick operation, no lag noticed.
5. Good build quality and premium looks.
6. Got built in GPS
7. Value for money, best under 7k

CONS
1. As I said before this is a stripped down version. Display is very small, good for ladies not men.
2. You can have only 4 watch faces on the watch at a time. This is due to limited storage.
3. Notifications too are limited, old ones get deleted. It cannot hold more than 4 to 5 notifications, big drawback.
4. Very less internal storage, Humai has not revealed it, but its very less.
5. No Alexa support as of now, need to wait for an update. However without a speaker, Alexa is not much of use on this watch. Hence you won't miss it.

Overall a great smart watch and value for money. However its display is quite small and lack of storage is a show stopper for me.",4
"Sound leak is there a bit of noise cancelation is need. Good bass, sound quality. Totally worth for the prize.",4
Very nice mobile üì≤,4
At the cost the mobile is one of the selected bests.,4
I was purchase in offer I feel it was better for me and sound quality is good charging is best min 10hrs,4
Product serial number removed...,4
"This device is totally worth the money if the performance is not considered, as MIUI is heavy for a Processor like MTKG85. Battery life is the best in this phone. Fingerprint sensor is smaller than the last models. Camera is normal.",4
Printer is good but i can't print directly from my T-Mobile Android phone.,4
"It's very nice product from sony, I purchased below 13k. Fast Bluetooth connectivity 5.0, sound crystal Clear enjoy TV programs and movies.",4
"Recieved hardware version A1, and it has no usb port. Registered the product on Dlink website for warranty. WiFi easily covers 2 storey home completely.",4
"A simple fuss-free printer. If your requirement is to only have a printer at home for occasional prints, this printer would do justice. Prints are clear, it‚Äôs easy to install and the initial cartridge I received is still able to deliver good prints. So far, I have printed close to 40pages with predominant black and sprinkling of color texts in the documents. Overall, good product and recommended for normal home use. I purchased the printer at a very competitive price of 1599 from amazon during the sale period.",4
Use Only For TEMP or Emergency,4
"Superb sound.Quality is good, delivery also not bad, compare with other online shopping it's better",4
I don't think it is noise cancellaation product. Sound and bass quality is good,4
Ok dependent of price ok,4
Had bought the same product 7 years ago and bought the same once more due to it's value for money.,4
Very good to use,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Update after 9 months. - no issues faced.
Mainly used for school related black and white and colour projects and homework. Also printing pictures occasionally on glossy photo paper and taking photo copies. Very happy with it's working.

Performance has been good for all my home printing needs. Good use for kid's school projects and ocassionall photo printing.

üëçEasy installation. Just follow the provided guide or video online.
Refer to pictures taken during self installation. If you are not comfortable handling electronics you can get free installation service from Canon.
üëâ I installed SW drivers on my Windows 10 machine.
üëç Excellent printing of text and documents.
üëç Good for home and office use.
üëé No duplex (both side) printing. You have to manually print put the paper back to print on second side. You can do it by printing odd and then and even pages of a document and putting paper or adjusting sequence of pages correctly.
üëé Controls on printer are basic and display is basic segmented LED and only shows number and moving light indicating status.
üëç Text and documents in BW and colour come out good. Tried documents and graphics including cartoons etc. See a sample image of lion and a mouse printed on standard chart paper cut into size of appx 4x6
üëç Photo prints are really good in terms of clarity and colour reproduction. Use photo paper for better results. I tried glossy photo paper and surprised and happy by results.(see sample - one print on 4x6 photo)
üëçGood quantity of ink provided in the box. Set of 3 colour bottles and 1 black bottles + 2 extra black bottles. Should be good for many thousands of prints. Canon puts yield at around 6000 B&W 7000 colour pages. Actual usage yield will depend on what we print.
üëçInk bottles included in pack are high yield ink bottles which fill the tanks fully. Black ink is 135ml and each of 3 colour bottles are 70ml. Compared to old cartridge style inkjet printers this is huge amount of ink.
üëâ Ink part numbers are GI-790 (Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow).
üëâ Current cost of ink from Canon is Rs470 per bottle (black or any colour) in Oct 2018. Even if you get a yield of 4000 pages B&W and 4000 colour pages compared to claim of 6000 and 7000 cost of 4 bottles set will be Rs 1880 so you will get an average cost of less than Rs 0.24.
üëâ Adding pictures of product and pictures of initial installation to give you idea about the product.
üëâ Also see image of test page and sample photos to show colour reproduction on a glossy photo paper.
üëâ Also adding a colour photo copy sample with original.
üëâ Successfully registered warranty on Canon India website - 1 year warranty is applicable.

‚òù Tip - Inkjet printer ink is water based and anything printed including photos will not be water proof. So protect photos and prints from water and moisture. If you want photos or prints to be water proof you can e.g. use fixative sprays or lamination or store them in albums or a frame. For photos I wish photo printing ink was water proof or atleast if there was paper that makes photos water proof.

‚òù Tip for photos - Our screens on phones or computers are usually set to brightness levels that photos look bright and pop out where as printer will print based on brightness and contrast on the image taken by camera so you may see prints to be less brighter compared to what you see on screen. You should be aware of this fact and as needed adjust the photo parameters like brightness and contrast, try few images - compare what you see on screen vs prints, before going with actual printing job.

Getting used for school projects and homework and for ocassional documents and photo copies. Happy with performance and costing per print.

Happy printing.",4

Bass quality is the best noice cancelation is also good but there is a demerit that your ears will start paining after you wear it for 20min as it is too tight,4

Good. Very useful. Hope the UPS had a button to completely turn off the power without turning off the mains. Right now turning off mains as well as well UPS is the only way to completely stop the power supply.,4
Good product... Just misses the world feature.,4
"This product is really good for gaming. There is no sound delay and the sound quality is good as well. I would recommend this for gaming. The only issue with this is that it is pretty big and the design isnt that good so its not good for casual use. There are other headphones with better and simple designs at the same price range so I wont recommend this for causal use. However, it's a nice gaming headphone.",4
"I received the product within the time span provided by amazon.The packaging was good.Installation procedure is provided on the canon website in a step by step manner.I got it up and running in around 30 minutes.The wireless printing and scanning works brilliantly with my laptop.For mobile devices, canon app needs to be installed.I also tried out cloud printing which does work but i do not use it frequently.I have been using it for more than a month now and am quiet satisfied with it.The quality of prints is good and the printing speed is decent.I do not have to worry about replacing the cartridges or in this case to fill in the ink anytime soon.Scan quality is also good.For an ink tank printer the size is very compact which i like.The main drawbacks would be that the printer is a bit noisy and the built quality is not very robust.Nothing that affects the performance of the printer though.The printer came with 6 ink bottles,Two black and one each of blue red and yellow.The picture of the print that I have posted is on a 6 inch by 4 inch photo paper with high quality settings.The price point is also good compared to other ink tank printers.All in all I am satisfied with the product and service by amazon.I would like to give a 4.5 rating but unfortunately that is not an option.",4
Good base...,4
Works well as a normal router. Good customer support in Hyderabad.,4
Bluetooth connection should be better,4
Nice router at this price.. No problem at all.. Even it's not heating much.. On/off button is missing.. dnt worry you can use electric swich directly to solve this,4

"Music player automatically slow down in the middle of the song playing, please response this problem.
As per this model of mobile, camera needs protection of back cover because without back cover camera not in a safe position when anybody uses this mobile and puting on table or anywhere.
I don't like this you don't provide back cover for this mobile. As per current situation of covid, shops are not opened,I am not able to buy back cover of it",4

The think which I not liked about the product is its connectivity some times it disconnects automatically from mobile and one more thing to be rectify is the steps counts which are not accurate.,4
Camera is not as per expectation,4

Scanning aap is not good. No preview for croping after scan.... And destination file cann't chosen easily...,4
The product is good but paper gets often jammed,4
Samsung is truly a Monster with 6000 mAh battery with 8 nm processor. 128 GB Internal memory is really good to have along with 6 gb RAM where the games r loading very smoothly. True 48 Mp quad camera is truly wise to capture the photos. The phone is very slim and 90 hz refresh rate is really awesome. 16.55 cm infinity V display is cool. In total this mobile is one of the best to have at this range of prices. Moreover the backside of the phone is having a matte finish which is very good and not slippery.,4
Very good.This product was amazing.. I really enjoyed.. becoz it was very usefull to me. And finally snapdeal is really veralevel..,4

Smart connect is not that great. 5GHz supported devices also preferring 2.4GHz only at times. Apart from that everything else is smooth.",4

this monitor has a very good screen only problem is speaker volume is extremely low couldn't hear anything,4
Great product in the price range,4
Doesn't hurt your ear for long term use,4
Bass was good but being a 40mm driver i would say that the bass was not so much punching and the other side adjustment is not working correctly its difficult to pull and i feel comfortable to wair it . Over is good,4
"Pros: Great product for the price. Has all all functionalities. The best part is the screen brightness and the text size incorporates all types of messages.

2. BPM
3. BP

6. Step count
7. Notifications and text
8. Calls

Cons:
1. Very limited App features
2. Even though its claimed that you can have numerous watch faces, only 5 presets are available. So you have to be searching continuously and that too only one watch face gets updated. 4 remains as preset. Annoying.
3. The mic and speaker can be much better.",4
Product is amazing. Just reverse print feature is missing..,4

"C1200:- I was on 30mbps earlier. Was receiving full speed (sometimes a little more with nat boost) on both bands. Now, I am on 100mbps internet. Getting almost full speed on the 5GHz band. But the range of 5GHz is not that great (maybe similar compare to other same price range routers). It covers my home first floor around 1000sq.ft but there is no 5GHz signal on the 2nd floor. 2.4GHz band works well considering its range. I even receive enough signal to the second floor, in every corner. But I was getting around 50-60mbps only in this band. Disabling Nat boost did the trick- now it's going up to 85-90Mbps. Restarting router takes around a min. The cloud option works well. Also have not experienced any kind of lag or hang. Have not checked USB connectivity. So far, a good purchase.",4
"One of the best smart watch alternative & very useful specially in COVID times. Trendy looks, light weight and still sturdy, visually appealing screen, accuracy of features and great battery life.

Two pairs of extra ear buds +

So all features are great for reasonable price.i bought for 499 rupees.
P.s:made in China product .
Designed by usa",4
Good product from Amazon giving more band width even at time connected to multiple devices,4
"Product is good and easy to control through the app. But not too much of a difference in signal strength as compared to old tp-link dual antenna router. Bought this for dual band support. There is however issue with installation if you have internet setup as PPPoE, you need to change the MAC address to your old router MAC for the connection too work. Also remember to reboot after the MAC change.",4
Contact not work,4
It's working smoothly. I am not a hardcore user so it's not a big deal,4
Nice product...must buy,4
"Watch at price range is good. Looks perfect. Other functions working almost good. But only irritating thing is, it needs to sync daily to get notifications.
I lost my charging cable & now my watch is useless without charging bcz there is no option of buying charging cable seperately.",4
"Delivery was awful. Amazon sends a pin to validate the recipient but of no use.
They will just give it to anyone they wish though my family members were present. They didn't even call. This is least of the expectation from Amazon delivery.
I have bought this for the 2nd time and I have enjoyed it.
Previous one lived for 9 months inspite of good care",4

But, the main issue is that one of the bud will stop working maybe in 5-6 months.",4
"Face recognition is slow. otherwise the phone is super awesome. My 4 months old iPhone se 2020 ran into some hardware issues, due to pandemic I couldn't service it. So I brought this m12 phone, just to be in budget for obvious reason. This phone is under 9999 and if your expecting performance similar to a 40k, then your review needs a think over. This phone exactly does or does more than what it's priced. If you are low budget and want more out of it with some limitations, go for it.",4
"Sound and bass v good
But noise cancellation not üö´ good.",4
Got it for Rs.599 during sale an its worth the price. sound an bass quality is good. FM is ok outdoors. got this for my kid so he wont use in ear headphones.,4

The product is working fine. no problems with connectivity at all... but the range is not as expected. Doesn't penetrate 3 walls. But am I asking for too much?,4
"It's a decent mid-range gaming monitor with refresh rate up to 75hz. You don't need AMD graphics to get the free sync, it works just fine with Nvidia. it's a good product for someone who's into casual gaming. the only con with the product is its Stand, it might take up your desk space if you got a small desk but overall it's a decent monitor for entry-level gaming.",4
Phone is good but screen guard is already there on the phone... That's the problem.. Now I have a doubt that it's a new phone or used one.,4
It's a great band with almost all features but don't forget to put a screen protector as soon as you buy it as my screen had a little scratch when I crashed with a bench. The screen is little popped out.,4
Has a watch later button in YouTube notifications unlike Redmi note 8.,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Best smart watch in this price",4
Good like,4
Serving me well. Mine is just home purpose.,4
It gets discounted with mobile frequently. Everytime connect with Bluetooth.,4
i m using this product from a week. easy to istallation and setup. it fully support windows 8 but in 8.1 RT verson it doesnot support the wifi. so pease be aware thiking of using with it with windows 8.1. I update my laptop WINDOWS 8 TO 8.1RT then my wifi doesnot work ... it shows limited connection....MAY BE IT SUPPORT WINDOWS 8.1 RT,4
build quality is good. sound quality is balanced. noise cancellation is great in this price range but bass can be improve by JBL. not for gammers.,4
In this price range phone is completely best only charging adapter charged slowly.,4
Sound quality is good but it comes off from ears very easily.,4
Dependable,4
Snug Fit does not work for charging. So I have to tie the band using plastic tie wire every time I charge (see photo). I request MI to replace me a new charging cable.,4
"First of all satisfied with the early scheduled delivery.
It makes very difficult to configure and identify that the LAN cable is damaged. It cost me additional 500/- to ask a technician to help me out to setup my this modem router.",4
Good quality in sound.,4
Quality is good. Initially found difficult to fit being being size but steady got set. Only things that price changed too fast. Within one day rate slash down by INR 1000/-,4
Excellent Phone Under This Price,4

"Great smartwatch. Impressed with data measurement accuracy, screen clarity, metal body and display.",4
"Got it for all the members now locked in. Reduces the cacophony at home. ""Noise"" cancellation redfined.",4
"If you‚Äôre into EDM, Hip Hop, then you should buy this. Lows are fantastic, mid & highs are alright. But it‚Äôs a budget headphone and you‚Äôre getting beast in that category.
If you like sound straight, then it is not recommended, because of great lows you cannot really feel any magic in highs and mid. It felt a little lifeless when used for jazz, classical, alternative.",4
"It was good but not so satisfied ...
If it does call answer facility then it'll be more appreciable ......",4
Nice mobile in this price... And amazing battery backup,4
Ok,4
"good printer in this price nice printing,scan photocopy i am giving 4 instead of 5 because printer installation cd missing",4

"Easy to install, I didn't find Wi-Fi signal best though it is good",4
"The color cartridge supplied with the item was faulty, I had to purchase another HP 803 from Amazon",4
Excellent phone for regular use,4
"Counts steps while driving, doesn't sleep track in day time. Battery is supb, see attached snapshot. Drained only 52% battery in 11 days.
Editing after 1 year-
1. Strap got broken in exact 1year, Try to order with one exyra original starp.
2. Now battery lasts 15-16 days

Everything else is going fine like new.
Else everything is same like it was",4
Good quality.Verry good product,4
"I bought this mobile for my Grandmother. As per her usage, it's quite good but when it comes to usage by me. It wouldn't meet the need. Camera quality is pretty average but it is decent as per the pricing. Battery life is good. It easily gives around two days for normal usage. It's handy and perfect for normal users overall it's a good mobile for normal users.",4
"Good one. May not be of best quality that comes with a price of course, but overall a good package.",4
Good budget phone...,4
So Vick,4
Auto focus is nice.,4
"Honest Review after 3 days

Printer is good but has a horrible sound
Though it has quit mode but in that mode it's speed reduces",4
It's very nice phone...value of money,4
"Been using since 2017 close to 1 year and 7 months.
If you want a worthy one under ‚Çπ700 this is okay to go. Don't expect much.

User Alert : Fragile item !! Handle with care !
Yes. Had to buy a new one since this was no longer usable due to cable damage! So please take care !

Moved to Sennheiser CX 275S.",4
Good Smartphone with decent battery life and good performance,4
Redmi note 9 best product but n re quality improvement,4
Very comfortable and easy to configure.,4
"1) Good for Talking.
2) Bass is good.
3) Wire length might be around 5feet.
4) Comfortable to use on moderate use but for long duration ears hurt sometimes.
5) Using it since October 2018
6) September 2019 now it's showing some problem in wire maybe because when the wire is adjusted the sound comes back to normal.",4
"Compromises a lot on Battery, you can literally see each percentage gradually failing towards Zero! Overall a Good Package for someone looking for Basic Experience. Cameras are Good. Screen looks fabulous for the price point! Android Go version don't let you do a lot of things, and I mean it.",4
"It's nice product.. working fine. Delivered the product as promised by Amazon. Anyone wants to buy router for private broadband like reach,act, home broadband",4
Quality is a bit dissapointing. Could have been better to match sony standards. There's no warranty card and the packing compels you to believe it as a fake item. The wire could have been lengthier and volume a bit higher. This item doesn't provide total isolation of the surrounding sound. But one can't expect more at such a price!,4
It is a great phone but it has no dual/twin App option for all apps. You may use dual App option for WhatsApp and messenger only.,4
"As usual, one needs to install lot of bloated HP apps on your phone to get this to work with WIFI.

I am surprised why HP cannot use Android's inbuilt functionality and provide a single light weight app for wireless printing.",4
Overall good.very nice Good,4
Excellent.Easy to use,4
Nice product in this range 3000.,4
On time. As expected,4
It's an amazing product. Loved the sound quality and all. Not like other brands which spoil the sound quality for more bass. Only downside is that the wire is too thin and should be used carefully.,4
Awesome for bass loving people.noise cancelation is also good and feels quite premium product and worth every penny,4
Jab box kholte Hain tab problem to..,4

"I am able to work with TV, mobile phones and tabs. Configuration and use is simple. It is helpful.",4
The best watch under 5k but the noise fit app has a lot of bugs. The fitness tracer is almost accurate. The app takes a lot of time to sync your activity. Go for it if you have a budget of 5k.,4
Overall the product is good but there is some issue with the recording on Micro SD Card,4
Look perfectly,4
Good product ..5hz for max 30ft distance.. Bt 2.5hz range is good ..I used it for my 3floor house .. My internet pack is 30mbps..its give 20-25mpbs ..,4
"Good router, bought this 3 yrs ago, for ACT BB connection. But now it's not very useful, as i my current ISP plan is > 100Mbps. Which this model doesn't support.
Plus lot of interference with neighboring WIFI routers, losing a lof of bandwidth. At max i can use this as a repeater.",4
All kinds of latest features available..,4
"I like the product as it has nice sound quality for music lover and call quality is also at par. The only thing is, it should have a clip to hold the mic near mouth, as the mic is placed at a distance and sometimes the person on other side could not hear us.",4
"Spo2 readings are misleading many times..rest functions are well, battery life may also be enhanced.",4
"1. I like bettry backup. 2. Sleep tracking is so good.
1. Face watch degital screen is not much good.",4
Recommended for daily use,4
"product is very good. print quality , scanning quality is also very good.
but the main issue is ink one cartridge and print 70 to 80 pages it also depends on the what you are printing
and Ink is very expensive.",4
"Excellent product. Good Range better than iball baton

Screen is too small. Letters are very small can't read properly.,4

"Good product SPo2 Body temp measurements ,Heart BPM, is good mob app is also helpful walking steps counting is very good for excersize",4
Screen should light up when lifting hand,4
"A good buy, the UI could have been better, and the backlight is a little saturated, but apart from that, a very good reasonable watch for Android users.",4
Base are very good and noise cancellation also good but Bluetooth connectivity is very poor .,4
"The headphones have a very good cushions on the head and over the ear. It comes with multiple connectivity options and has 1 3.5 mm socket and 6.5 mm socket inputs. The controls are well placed and the bluetooth range is pretty decent upto 8 meters. There is no active noise cancellation but the cushion and the strong headband holds the speakers close to the ear and external noise doesn't reach your ears (not sure how long the stiffness of the headband would hold). The only annoying thing with the headphones is , it pauses the music, every 15 sec to make the low battery warning though the battery was shown to be at 40% on my smartphone.",4
"Battery life is good
Camera is not that much cool
Processor is good
Audio level is little bit low...
Overall really cool",4
Very good product.value for money.battery backup is awesome.,4
Superbüëç,4
Im not able to see what‚Äôs app or other apps notifications on my band please let me know the solution.,4
Good product.after one week of use 1aux(led TV output) 4/5.2 FM 4/5 3 bt 4/5. USB 4.5/5 good sound quality& bass for this price. Speakers build quality sturdy(wooden).remode is good. Look is good.vip note USB will be detected only if it contains mp3 audio files.if u have mp4 video songs only it will not function.only deliver person behaviour is bad,4
Product is very nice but I have some time connetivity issue & the screen size is too short.,4
Headphones are very good. Passive noise cancellation is excellent. Cushion is very soft. Can be used continuously for long hours without any discomfort even when wearing specs. Bluetooth connectivity and sound quality is also excellent. One point which could have been better is that the extension plate could have been little longer as it fits little tight to my head.,4
Good it is hooo good mi product is better than others company ok by me and I am not sure if you have any questions or need any further information please contact me at the end of the point of view of the point of view of the point of view of the point of view of the point of view of,4

Super sound quality,4
"Good device compare to Netgear Ax3000. however saw 2 issues and not sure if I got defect piece or all are same.
1) when nearby, mobile speed goes very low and not able to browse in mobile. every time, restart of router is needed which is irritating
2) When we hide SSID in advance settings (even though SSID enabled), n/w going beyond range and so not connecting",4
"I loved the product üòç very much , good performance , long lasting battery, everything is good but camera is not so good",4
Good Adsl Wifi Router.. Covers my 1500 sqft flat with no issues and speed also fast,4
This product is very good for domestic use and for journey.,4
"Loved the product - Body temperature, Heart rate, Blood pressure and most important SPO2 monitor in one smart watch. The GOQii app is nice and informative. Must buy for your self and family.
I have some issues when i connect the Smart watch with Mobile App.
1. Phone keyboard not working when i connect the smart watch with Bluetooth to the Mobile App.
2. Cannot receive group message notifications from Whatapp on Smart Watch only gets individual message notifications.",4
I will say it's worth in terms of looks. Also the prising is comparatively good. Sleep tracking and accuracy can give 4 Mark's out of 10 only. If you are looking for accuracy and sleep monitoring proceed with fitness band rather than this. If you giving priority for the looks and attraction this will suit for your money.,4
"Can't receive cal ,only can get alert....",4
"Performance is good, Value for money",4
Good product and performance as expected,4
Worth to buy it good quality product,4
Good Wireless router - easy to setup and has good range. It gives a strong signal upto 5 stories below and above my apartment. All wireless devices stay connected without any issues.,4
Its a nice product but still i feel my old TP LINK router was better.,4
"It's not MDR-ZX110A, it's MDR-ZX110. They're both the same headphones except the former is with mic, and the latter is not. Since the product description says that it doesn't come with a mic, I wasn't surprised.",4
Its a good wireless router. Sturdy build. Lives up to the expectation for home use. Worth its price.,4
Nice product.. Super.. Bass,4
"If you don't tend to use your mobile data or the wifi often, or even stream videos, its a great choice",4
Good non glossy display . In built speakers could not produce satisfactory sound.,4
"Installation is not an easy task, Driver provided by HP is not supported in PC having windows 8.1, additionally it required Microsoft.NET framework for fully operational. After that again having some issue of USB port.",4
The earphone is good for phones only. If you use it in lappy then it will give echo...which is not preferred. So choose wisely.,4
Good Performance,4
"Watch is awesome but screen is lil small ,noise have to increase the size of screen",4
Nice. Still exploring,4
jcuc,4
"The product is excellent but I‚Äôm not satisfied with delivery,they called me to their office for collecting the parcel instead their executive should have delivered that to home",4
Easy to use and worth it.,4

Pros-nice sturdy design,good sound quality and a thick lond cord definitely a must buy specially in this range
Cons-great amount of sound leak
Overall deserves 4 stars of 5",4
"Its a great product. Install it in the right place, and you wont need an extender for your 3 BHK. Easy to set-up and the 2.4G/5G dual mode manages your range and connectivity easily. The mobile app (you have to download) is handy too.

I am giving it 5 starts as I prefer another model from TP link (Archer C1200) - this one has pen-drive support. Unfortunately it is not easily available these days",4
"Pros:
Battery- excellent
Performance- Good

Cons:
Camera- average
Audio- average
Display- Not up to mark.
Weight- heavy",4
Overall a very nice product. It is worth it's money,4
"Awesome Product:
Used almost 20days.
Look is awesome and display have change Wallpaper feature and colourful display, ‚ù§Ô∏è rate sensor is good, but Workout mode is not so accurate specially when you travel, but GPS accuracy is very good, battery is so good if no notification is active, will give you 15+ days backup, but once you on the all Notification like mail WhatsApp messenger and others, batter bavkuy is also most 10 days. But no issue it takes 30 min to charge the battery.
You can control the music player means next and previous and volume increase and decrease.
Overall good experience with the Mi band 4.",4
No problems with bsnl broadband. Normal coverage. Best for small houses,4

Nice product but display was not so bright but it's ok I am satisfied with this product,4
"Review after 3days of use:
Overall call quality and sound is loud and clear even at low sound levels. But if you are a bass lover don't go for this product. The earplug also doesn't fit well and is bit uncomfortable.",4

Product was good but found little damaged from a corner but nothing to worry.

Ok Product,4
"Nothing fancy, nothing surprising. But everything is working as expected. I feel quality and accuracy is better than its competitors. You will love wearing it.!!",4
Limited faces ..... little inaccurate in hand motions,4
"Good one. Best monitor for work from home.
If you connect through hdmi, laptop or PC will transfer audio to monitor. Sound quality is not sufficient. But, I always use headset for attending meetings. So, not a problem for me.
Better go for wall mount, you need to buy Vesa stand seperately. Quality of display is awesome",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Comfortable to wear, sleep tracking works when u turn on DND and turn wrist movement off.
Mobile app is not good, need improvements. Touch screen works fine.",4
its not covering 3 BHK better till 1 or 2 bhk only,4
Everything is ok.. But i think the Bluetooth range is short and the step counting is not up to the mark,4
"Best headphone under rs 2000.
I really loved it.
I got it for rs 1499.
Thanks for such an amazing wireless headphone.
Thanks to boat rockerz.......",4
Good product...go for it if you are looking for dual band routers,4
"Touch of screen is not up to that mark.
Phone lags many times but it's ok with respect to its pricing.",4
"Over all the the product is good. Clarity of the touchscreen good but in the sunlight difficult to read. The strap is good. I find a little mismatch with the shape of watch and strap. The spo2, heart rate and blood pressure are okay with reading near the exact figures. Steps, exercise etc.are Exactly as the costly watches.
The navigation between screen is awesome.",4
Photo quality is good.text quality poor.,4
I did not like when I buyer it it was at rs.12000 but after 2 week it was in 11000.,4
"Good average phone little costly
Can get infinix with major upgrade
Camera not worth it
Processor fine
Memory fine
Its average

"JBL C100SI HAS A GREAT SOUND AND PERFECT BASS AND TREBLE. ITS REALLY VALUE FOR MONEY ITS PERFECTLY FIT IN EAR ON FLICPKART ITS LOOK BIG IN SIZE BUT ITS PERFECT FIT.ITS HAS REALLY AWESOME SOUND.

APART FROM THIS I AM USING SONY SBH24 HEADPHONE WHICH IS COSTING RS 3500.00 & SONY MDR-XB55AP WHICH IS COSTING AROUND RS 2200 WHICH HAS A GREAT SOUND
BUT BELIEVE ME JBL C100SI COSTING RS 550 HAVE GREAT SOUND.

JBL ROCK BUT THE DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY NEED TO IMPROVE BUT FOR RS 550 ITS REALLY VALUE FOR MONEY.

I HAVE USED SENHEISER CX180 IF YOU LOVE EXTRA BASS U PURCHASE SENHEISER CX180.BECAUSED IT HAS UNWANTED HIGH BASS.",4
It's a good product for the price range,4
Wifi signal range is incredible. The interface is a bit ageing. Received it a bit late. Rest everything's is fine.,4
I liked this product very much. Accurate at step check; sp02 ; body temperature but bit disappointed at blood pressure checking .. I had given 5 rating if bp monitoring could have been satisfied.Over all one can consider to buy it....,4

Battery life is good last long when compared to resmi note8 and pro .. which a friend of mine is using,4
Good but not comfortable for long time,4
"Great product, wifi Signal doesn't drop",4
Overall good battery backup is also good but I miss the finger print lock.,4
A decent phone but not meant for heavy tasking..Screen is decent..Samsung UI is working good.Sound is Decent ..Charging time is little bit Higher due to huge battery ( Approx 3 Hours for 0-100%)and charging wire is very small.Camera is good.Fingerprint Scanner is decent.Phone is little bit Heavy but its easy to handle.Phone is for normal user not for gaming as sometime phone feels that exynos 850processor is not providing full power.,4
"Really Nice Phone... For Look, Function Usability, Face Lock Security! Amazing!",4

But during heavy downloading or multiple user router need to be restarted (occasionally).",4
Very problems as of now . No sure if this will be durable . Good product at this price.,4
WORKING FINE,4
Delivered on time. Received V3. I expected V2. Glad for that. Looks good & the updates for the router are frequent. No issues till now (using for the past month),4
"It's a lightweight watch and somewhat resembles the Apple Watch. It nicely performs the basic functions of a smartwatch. It has been nearly 1 month since I have been using it. One minor issue I observed is that, when the screen is off and we lift our wrist to see the time, sometimes there is a delay in displaying the time.",4
"Worth for money.

Nice to use.",4
"I ordered the smart watch after searching some reviews on online platforms. I got the product on time. Great experience. Build quality and battery life is extremely great. I didn't face any issues until this time. Also the budget of this watch is affordable. I recommend everyone, who searching a best smart watch under 5000",4
Fire boltt smart watch a grt product at an economical price. If u are health conscious then I will tell u that bp accuracy is not gud just shows some random numbers but heart rate and oxygen saturation are to the point..Touch is gud and app connectivity is also gud..,4
"This smart vital watch should not cost more than Rs. 2000, because 1. It is not even IP67 compliant 2. It measures distance incorrectly by assuming a fixed step size for all. 3. No user entetable step size 4 BP measurement-- more clarity is required how to set the range and what are range limits. Gives some fixed numbers based on range selection 5.Most other lower cost watches give camera control also but not this. 6. SpO2 measurement takes infinite time.
Sleep tracking is good. Mobile App is intuitive. Should have the facility to export data in csv format. Recently, an equivalent watch with all these features have come in the market with less than half price. So, Goqii must improve the performance.",4
"Product is good but delivery isnt very smooth, delivery agent did not even cooperate while making a payment",4
"Heart rate and spo2 is accurate.
Could improve touch and wake up sensitivity..",4
there are trails fo white light like shadow when u move screen fast while playing games ..rest picture quality is good,4

Set up is really easy. I am using this as an extender..it's perfect candidate for multiple device to stream. Worth every cent spend.,4
Good product and nice look,4
"Using for programming and its more than enough.
For moderate gaming this will work
Con
Only issue is , power cable has power plug which is 16A plug which does not fit in normal indian sockets but you can also order power adapter and it will work. See photo for power plug and adapter.",4

The product is very good sounds wonderful but analog cable is very poor. So please I am recommended to HDMI cable within the package.,4
"Battery life one day useing 50per, battery life problem , but nice smart watch good look",4
Length of wire is very small and can't set in corners of the room...other than that the product is good.The only drawback is the length of the wires.If anybody want to set the satillite sepakers in each corner please dont buy this and you cant feel the sorround effects.Thank you,4

Range limited",4
"The sound quality is good, continuous usage hurts a lot.",4
"Decent router for a 1BHK (450 squre feet) or for use as a repeater. Has the universal repeater function inbuilt which is nice. WiFi coverage is average so don't expect great coverage if your router is placed in the corner of the house. However, speed provided is perfect, no compromises there. Installation is a breeze. Overall a decent product if bought for around INR 800.",4
"Printer works fine and colour lasts very longer than ink-jet printers. As per purchase terms, it is mentioned as free installation service shall be provided at site/home, but they will provide only telephonic guidelines. Better to search you-tube for installation procedure rather than to depend on company service.",4
Recd the router as described by the seller and have been using for past few months with good connectivity - recommend this to all for use with a BSNL Broadband connection,4
Nox Charger.Very good product,4

"Battery life ok, camera quality not expected.",4
Real good.. Worth buying if you just need mobile for basic stuffs like calling and texting. Overloading shouldn't be done.,4
It's amazing and has a reasonable price. One can buy this watch if someone have a lesser budget. Sports mode is very useful.,4
Good ok..,4
Loved everything came on given time but bit disappointed with Amazon I have ordered so many thing from amazon but they never send me free gitfts üòû,4
It is really nice in tracking a lot of info that didn't have in the first place.Sleep tracking works 95% fine at fine. Not sure about sleep tracking during day time.The app is relly flexible and can change a lot things . The display and built quality is great.,4

Seems fine till date. Hoping that it stays like that in future.,4
"Good product

I loved everything except the fact that this didn't have any microphone,4

"I am writing after using for a week now. The touch response, screen display is amazing. Sound clarity is good and the loud speakers too, which was not great in my earlier samsung J6 model.
Battery is average only, though it is a 5000mah, lasts for less than 48 hrs for average usage. Basis on the usage of other samsung modela and other brands i would recommend.",4

Fingerprint very fast and bettery bachup is gud,4
"Its definitely an excellent product from GOQii and works perfectly as described. The sensors are quite accurate and the watch is ideal for someone who wants to stay on the top of their health game. Detailed metrics, O2 levels etc. are quite accurate. SpO2 levels as most of you would be aware, today is the first sign of being COVID positive. The watch eliminates the need of an Oximeter as SpO2 can be monitored on the watch itself. Only thing, I feel the app and the way mobile notifications are handled could have been much better.",4
"Watch is working good,
But, both the apps noise fit and da fit are not quite good.
They need to be updated and specially for heart rate monitor which scan only after 30 minutes and i want it to be scan in every 10 minutes like mi fit works.",4

"The Wifi signal is a bit weak as I able to get only 75Mbps as opposed to 200M on Ethernet. Otherwise the router is a great value for its price, installation is a breeze and works right out of the box.",4
Like the look but have doubts on the accuracy for Heart Beat and sleep tracking.,4
I have a 3500 built up area of 3 floors and the signal is pretty good everywhere and also the speed. Worth buying it!,4
this monitor is good but the adjustment of brightness and color need to be done manually and it irritating btw amazing picture quality with 5 ms response time . i will update this after usage time to time,4
Because not valid reason,4
"Overall product is very nice
Good In

Cons
1. More LED lights needed

Good product to buy. Better to buy during sale period for best pricing.,4
"Picture is not as good as expected, good battery life eith moderate use and ofcourse abundant of storage with good amount of RAM.",4
"Its amazing product it gives over more than 10 mts range
Dont use more than 100 mbps plans ,if u are using then would take upto 50 to 60 mbps range, then go to netgear product
Normal 5mpbs plans were good to this and it gives 12 to 14 mbps upload speed , so affective
Its so budjet product price is below 1500

3) Tech support

You don't need to contact tech support because manual contain all the possible info u needed.",4
"This is my first ever smartwatch and I love it. It has various useful features. Watchfaces are nice that can be downloaded from the noise app. Touch screen is smooth. Overall good product.

Cons:

1.Sometimes the noisefit app does not sync the sports activities performed.

2.No GPS feature in the watch.

3.KMS cycled not available.",4
"The first thought that came to my mind is - It's giftable. Using for one week and it functions well. Music sound is good. Call quality is manageable, not great. Fitting on-ear is OK not great.",4

Super battery backup,4
Really nice watch am using past 6 months no issues for me.. Definitely I will recommend to others..,4
Phone quality is good but not best,4
Good product but little expensive. Regular pc ups cost almost same and can connect more devices.,4
Good product. Packaging can be better though.,4
Wifi Range could be better for 5ghz . But main issue is with internet disconnection and frequent router reboot which is very annoying. I was using with railtel broadband and setting up is very easy with PPPOE .,4
Good product but the range is not quite as i expected. Overall a good experience with it. Happy with the product.,4
"Perfect print Quality, Best Printer in that budget segment. i suggest them who looks Printer with best Print output without making more noise, n deliver fast result.",4

"Touch function could have little better. Rest all comes in a very good deal.. battery life, voice clarity, fit, meets the expectations.",4
"Satisfied with this.. as expected...
Battery life sound al good.. i loved design buildüòç",4
Received the product in 2-3 days. Very easy configuration. Slight dissatisfaction is in the range. I have a 40mbps (guranteed) fiber connection. In the drawing room (10meters away from router) I get around 30mbps on my laptop. But when i go to other areas (say 20 to 25 meters) the speed reduces to more than half (around 10 to 12 mbps.). Otherwise its working great.,4
Happy to have this. Good sound in this price segment,4

"Overall a good experience. Kind of very much a budget phone. Anyone looking for a phone with 10k please go for it. It will surely not disappoint you. Camera is pretty good for this range, so is the other facilities. Righting this review after using it for a month.",4
"I had FTH connection up to 200Mbps I has a router which was provided by my ISP, which lacked 5 GHz band. So I decided to buy this router which has 2.4 and 5 GHz. On using it has given me satisfaction. It‚Äôs very easy to install by using the TP link app it was done within minutes that was helpful. Regarding the range 2.4 GHz is not that great but ok as its same as what is the range provided by my ISP modem and the speed of 2.4GHz is little more. Regarding 5GHZ the range is good am getting full range inside my house and greater speed close to 100Mbps.
Please note that this is not a GIGABIT router it‚Äôs good for an average user. Hope it will help.",4
The screen in bright and I had no problem in the Sunlight seeing it. The problem is with the strap quality. If you wear it for too long in Warm days you will start feeling itching.,4
"Its feel me... "" Perfection...""& Satisfied.... drpkr",4
"Ok for the price it's quite a steal. I just wanted a regular headphone for basic utility like some multimedia streaming and a few calls and for that it's more than you would need .
However if you want an immersive music experience.for long hours I would definitely not suggest this as they are not very comfortable for extended hours of usage (more than 1 hr or so). Otherwise a great pair of earphones .

The only con that I have is that the bass is a little over the top ,and this is a very preferential thing to say but I find that no body would listen to any song with that much amount of bass in it ,but hey that's just me .And 1 more thing why in the world did you have to make the back of the eartip so damn sharp, I mean at times it hurts just while putting it in your ears. But that's just a design thing I would say .
I have been using it for a couple of months now and I have been very satisfied with the product .
I would recommend this only if you want a basic headset for your day to day use and for that it is a great bang for the buck.
But if you want a pure music experience then I would say that you have better products in the market.",4
Need update it's too boring with same dials,4
i ordered this product and recieved a torn/opened box. the product itself is fine. sound quality is fine. not too much bass. but i am fine with it.,4
"its good ,working well",4

"This product is far better than Boat 550.
Specially it's Thumping Bass & Loudness quite appreciatable.
I think if u purchase this product u won't regret for sure.

"PROS:
- Sets us the connection pretty fast
- Good range in the same floor where the router is kept - At least 2 rooms distance.
- Set-up is a breeze.
- Good design
- Not much heating

CONS
- Upstairs, there is range in the room just above only.",4
Minor connectivity issues....but it's managable.,4
"In this price you cannot get anything better sounding
Built quality, sound ,performance üëå all good",4
"good but 3 LAN and 1WAN Ports, one LAN port less.",4
Nice watch having a lot of features.,4
The touch screen of the watch is a little slow and it lags when you scroll down. Otherwise its a perfect purchase for a digital watch. The battery is amazing and lasts for 7-10 days even after full usage of the watch. It even looks good fashion wise.,4
"Good product with decent touch response . Nice looking for hand, pulse rate working fine.. quality built.. but there are only few dial styles...text Messages option is poor.",4
Mobile is soo good in this price range it's really value for money but camera quality could improved little more like when I was capturing a subjects face it's making the face looking fake like kinda oil painted that could be improved and performance is really good in this price range,4
Working perfectly. A good sound quality. Bass is nice. Comfy and overall a reasonably priced pair of earphones.,4
"Easy to use and handle, handy grip, smooth interface and good picture quality. Price is also okay. Good for beginners.",4

good speakers,4
Good headset among price range... Though the battery is not long lasting.. other things are quite good...,4
Not bad to hear.Earphones üéß bhut aachai hai ummid se bhi jayada,4
I liked the headphone. It is very comfortable to wear for long periods owing to the fact that its an around-the-ear headphone. The bass quality was disappointing though.,4
"Genuine product, amazing performance and value of money, camera quality also nice and storage is the Highlight of this product",4
"Good product for health monitoring, and daily fitness and looks cool in every occasion, loved it and it's performance. Thanks for the amazing product",4

Good product but less accuracy.,4
"All things nice but two.....reason for only 4 *
1- Bass quality not soo good
2-on using long time, cause irritation on ear pinnah",4
Snadeal.Nice product   feels like  sit in a car  best sound quality and bass but for my ear its less comfort,4
"I bought it for 14.5k as I was in a desperate need of a mobile handset. Initially I wished to buy M21 but my budget couldn't get any higher at that time. But I like this mobile for :
- Performance
- Battery
- Mid Level Graphics Gameplay (I'm playing Need For Speed: No Limits)
- Good Touch response and Movie Watching Experience in spite of not having AMOLED Display

Only Negative part is that :
- Back Cover Design Colour could've been more stylish
- Camera could've been better.
In this price range now one can get 48MP Camera Mobile.
So At least 25MP for Main Rear Camera and 13 / 16MP for Selfie Camera was expected.

That's All.",4
Overall the sound us ok but bass quality is poor,4
Nice phone in this low budget but have it heating problem and it is not I am expected but no problem but its battery 3000mah match but its not a problem on this but that's the problem is the heating when I call overnight charging small hits now I don't know how it's much more than I am used for years and months but no problem with small problem setting setting is not a problem in my that's Samsung M20 17999 but its prices 5000 that price for a accuracy prices for Nayan Nayan name good for no problem and I am not use much so I will editor review after using more,4

2. Sturdy built
3. Decent sleep tracking

9. You can reject calls from the watch, which is a great help
10. You can receive all notifications on this band.",4
"Really nice product with some minor scope of improvements:
1. Has a good amount of lag. I initially though it is because of my phone's modem but later I took Airtel Fiber connection and initially the camera didn't connect. After resetting it it worked but there is a lag.
2. Lot of rotation on start of camera which can be avoided.
3. Sound quality is very poor and there is a lot of lag and disturbance and the person at the door can't understand what you are speaking due to noise.
4. Noise cancellation is not there so whatever you speak is heard back to you and thus creating an infinite loop of noise.",4

Good Bass but sometimes Bluetooth problm,4
Great product with longtime battery life...,4
Great in range,4
Overall it is a good printer. Claimed print count is good. It has to be seen what will be the reality. Print speed is good once the printer is up and running. Scan and print speed could be better. Scan tools provided with the printer is not that great. Copy function is good but takes time and does not have option to take multiple copies. Wifi strength is not that great. Initial setup was a bit painful,4

I have 6-8 devices connected to wi-fi at any one time and I've had no problems with any of them getting disconnected from time to time like I had with my old router.

Worth value for money,4
"As 4k monitors go, LG has a decent monitor here. Not the best, not the worst. But the panel quality could certainly have been better. I got a product with strong green tinge and bleeding at bottom half of screen, so I requested a replacement which I promptly got. However, after a few weeks, same problem arose with the replacement as well. Strong green tinge at bottom left and right corners which becomes very obvious in dark scenes and pictures. In bright display, it is not noticeable.
Major facts that I have observed till now:
1. It heats up a bit in bottom half as well. It is quite perceptible difference in temperature between top half and bottom half which you can feel at the side edges of the monitor.
2. Strong bleeding at bottom right and left corners to green tinting, especially in dark scenes it is quite evident.
3. Does have 2 HDMI ports and 1 display port. One more display port would have been a plus.
4. Does have audio output port.
5. Had great vertical adjustment, you can tilt monitor full 90 degrees from landscape to portrait, but no swivel option.
6. 60 Hz refresh rate at 4k quality.
7. Is fully G-sync compatible though N-Vidia doesn't list it as so and works perfectly via display port with g-sync/N-Vidia card in my setup (1660Ti)

All is all, Amazon service and Appario are top notch service providers till now. Delivery is great. Packing was superb, replacement was super quick as well. However,, I am sure you can find a better 4k monitor if your budget will allow you to go just a bit higher. The green tint and light bleeding does interfere with quality.",4

This is a nice mid range headphone and good for hearing music.,4
Batter doesn't seems to be that powerful which company claims. Else other things are value for value,4

Bass :3.5/5
Noise cancellation :4/5.
If 400/- is your budget ,just go for it .",4
"The headphone was very cool , sound quality was very good in this amount .",4
Fine worth for product,4
"If you're looking for an entry level 300mbps wireless router this is the one. Feature packed model and coverage/range is pretty good. Used it both as an extender and a router, works brilliant. Very lightweight and easy to install.",4
Its a nice product it's loud and has an excellent noise cancellation which makes it perfect for this price range. Also you have dual mode either bluetooth or wire which makes people using phones without 3.5mm jack life simpler.,4
"Overall it is a good phone with great battery life. I didn't like the camera quality, could have been better. But you can't expect much from 7.5 K phone.",4
Beware It's only usable if you have MTNL broadband or otherwise A telephone cable used as a internet connection (RJ11). Thankfully I could return it in this lockdown! But for the days I had this. I can say it has a good range even beyond 3 walls. And a reliable piece of hardware to have!,4
Nice mini threater.,4
Value of money good product,4
Everything is all right . But one thing that is wearing it for long time is very painful for ears.,4
Comes with power cable and HDMI cable. Power cable is 16A 250V. However bought an additional 10A cable because I didn't have 16A socket.,4
"Good connectivity, user interface is good",4
"Working well for the past few months. Though it has 2 antennas, range is not sufficient to pass 3 walls to my living room.",4
"Good one, but a bit too much bass. When I tried to listen to an interview on my PC it was barely audible.",4
Suitable for home purpose,4
"The 2.5Ghz range did increase, but speed didn't increase much using 5Ghz. Please note, the maximum speed from this router will be 100Mbps even with 5Ghz and if you want higher speeds go for Gigabit routers.",4
The charger of this box is very very slow comparing to all redmi note series charger. It takes 3-4 hrs to get full charge. I use different charger for fast change.,4
"Very good smart watch. Ideal for all ages, very useful and informative. I will update further reviews after a long use.",4
"Built quality was okay. Not so strong, should handle it with care.

Sound quality was awesome, perfect, but bass was not so adequate, new JBL C200 Si is much better in sound specially in lows

Overall good impression",4
It's easy to use for beginners,4
A very useful product in case of frequent power disruptions. Easy to connect. Have just bought it; can't comment on the durability .,4
I loved the deep wine colour. Watch is very good for the daily use,4
"I like it......
Touch also fine",4
Need installation guy .....blue tooth and pen drive working... not connecting with TV sound,4
SD card is missing,4
Good product but please know before buy that no display for selection of number of copies to print. Every copy should scan and print it will waste of power for every scan.,4
You have provide us super fast charger. But it will not charge as you have mentioned. It takes approx. 1.45 hr to 2 hr to change from 0% to 100%. And as per specification of super fast charge it should charge it within 1.15 hr.,4
Range is poor. Plastic quality is not as good as old tplink router. It gets heated in normal room temperature. Booting time is more than old tplink router. Better buy archer c6 which is 200 rupee expensive than a6.,4
"Sir, installing drive is missing to product and product not working so this problem solved in a immediately. Thank you",4
"Product arrived with Headset, Audio and Charging cable. Tested with and without Bluetooth.
Calls are very clear. Music is very good with decent Bass.
Product arrived early than expected.

No Noise cancellation.
Though I am a Prime member, I bought this product for INR 3,300/- during Amazon Great Indian festival. But the very next day price reduced by 300.",4
It snugly fits into the ear holes. Sound quality is okay and no disturbances.,4
Accurate but still need to improve in step counting,4
"Good quality headphones by sony....
I got the deal at ‚Çπ425...
Have been using same piece over a year without any issues...
Do make sure to replace headphones if sound quality seems too low...",4
Tbh I expected a bigger screen display ratio and strap quality doesn't seem to be any better. Keeping these two aside pretty cool stuff. You people did outgrow yourselves and oh please some better watch faces please. There are a lot of unofficial ones around but looking for official submissions.,4
Got in good working condition.Nice product,4
Nice and good speed in wifi,4
Router is fine but delivery timing was not so good now a days... Product is good but delivery timing was not so good as expected as a prime membership.. so 1 star less for the delivery,4
Very good price,4
"Such a high end cellphone is provided without charger adapter & the c type cable doesn't fit to routine usb port..
Ridiculous",4
"This product is well packed and user manual is good. You cant connect with your smartphone directly with bluetooth. You need to download noisefit app for that and need to connect your watch. Connectivity is good. Fraction of seconds delay on notification. Display is good, feel is good. Looks is very good. SMS, like whats app, msg, facebook and other app notification you can see only. You can see the first line of each notification, but cant enter into the msg. To read the msg you need to use your phone(unless the msg is one liner).
Heart rate monitor is closely correct. Step count is good. Sports mode is great. Real count of a cumulative of 3 steps. Alarm works well. Truly water proof.",4
Worth it for 2k. High bass a bit low treble,4
"It's Not JBL, It's **Infinity Systems** a known brand from USA.
The company was started in 1986 in America and today, they are a part of the Harman International Industries.
Infinity made this Model (Hardrock 210) only for india. You never find this particular Model in Infinity's international website.
This company also make Car Audio Systems and Infinity is primary suppliers for Hyundai, Kia, Mitsubishi, Chrysler.

Now it's time to review the New Home Audio Systems by Infinity (Made for INDIA Only).

I am a professional Sound Engineer.

In my opinion, an essential aspect of good sound is whether it can be projected from the correct angle.

First you make sure that the satellite speakers are angled in the exact position that affords you clear sounds even when it‚Äôs playing at high volumes. no matter where your speakers are installed, you can aim the tweeters in your direction. For Sub, you can try different positions available in your room. Remember Sub is omni directional, you can feel the low frequency all over the place. So install your speakers carefully.

After listening some of my favorite songs, I must say...In this price range the speakers are okay.

Some review says that it's Superb, Excellent, Baap of all etc. It's not true.
But another thing is, How much you pay!!? I bought it for INR.3800/- and In this price I am OK with the sound quality.

Overall performance is ""Okay"" for this price range. Recommend for you.

*********Frequency Response********

Low frequency Tested = 29Hz
High frequency Tested = 18Khz
(As per my ear üëÇ)

********** About Bluetooth *********
This Audio System Only support SBC Audio Codec. (For Bluetooth Only)

Bluetooth Audio sample rate is 44.1kHz / 16 bit.

So you will get CD quality sound through Bluetooth.

(Unfortunately my Sub Woofer is not working, Replacing the same product without any hassle with Amazonü§ò)

NOTE: TODAY 17TH JAN 2020 - After 20-21 days, my subwoofer giving me a rattling sound.‚òπÔ∏è

NOTE: Today 11 th September 2020.

I fixed the problem.ü§ü",4
Clarity in sound. Its crisp. Value for money. My first JBL experience. But could have had a deeper bass. But for this point it works I guess.,4
"good sound and bass, light weight, but noise cancellation is doubtful",4
"Sound quality is good but one issue is low volume output... Sometimes you won't hear anything if volume is less than 40. Not sure we will get any software update for the same.
PS: If the provided satellite speaker wire length is not enough don't cut and join, it will lead to void your warranty.",4
M not satisfied with battery life....last long till 6days,4
Product looks good in first glance and has good sound quality.,4
All in one package of smart watch in this price.,4
Gives some backup. Nice. But don't expect it to last for 4 hours!,4
"Though product is good but left side USB ports are not working, checked with mouse",4
Excellent budget mobile if finger print is not available in this mobile that is only disappointment,4
It's performance is too good. Only problem is with start button. You have to press it hard to start the laptop,4
Sleep Tracking is not that perfect. App gets hanged sometimes. Yoga and breathe options are good.,4
Good device to purchase at this price. Feel satisfied with most of its inbuilt functions. Enjoying its use & my children are enjoying it even more especially while gaming.,4
Features like spo2 are really good,4
Finger print is working properly as expected on placed very low which has to be placed little bit of uper side.Phone is absolutely perfect specially cameras are perfect only the problem is with display as compared with other Samsung mobiles.Performance wise phone is stunning no heating issue found as such.,4
Very good condition and must be a good,4
Perfect modem for my home. Covers most of the areas in my home. The signal is strong and doesn't get too heated. The modem is on the whole day.,4
Good product at best price sound quality is better but not best so I recommended to buy boat Bluetooth sound bar,4
"Good product at a very negotiable price
.It's around 6 months & working fine.",4
Earphone missing,4
Easy to use...need to maintain properly,4
Jxjf,4
Eye may be out in some days,4
The air accumulation in pipes and it's time consuming to remove it.,4
Best Quality & Worth buying it.,4
"Its 2020
Missing
call accept function
Sp02
Battery backup of about 15 day easily",4
"Sub woofer is not that powerful for music listening if you want thumping/deep bass. Sound from soundbar and
surround speakers are very good but hissing sound can be heard while playing music,might be manufacturing defect.
Connectivity -5 *
Sound Quality-
(1)Voice- 5*
(2)Bass-3.5*
Best part is got at 12,600 inr during Republic day sale",4
Okay WiFi range is bit a problem,4
Sound quality is normal and sweet,4
Video quality is not so good as expected overall experience is great,4
"I like this smart watch ,look and feel is good as well as data capturing without flawless",4
Photo quality is not better in this price range and heating prblm ang lagging,4
"Mobile app is good, READINGS taken thru watch like HEART RATE,STEPS,OXYGEN LEVEL, TEMPERATURE, SLEEP MONITOR ARE REALLY GOOD. BLOOD PRESSURE VALUES LOWER DIASTOLIC IS ACCURATE BUT SYSTOLIC VALUES ARE NOT UPTO MARK. Anyhow a good product with service support in India. Highly recommended to check vitals temperature, oxygen level, heart rate,in these COVID times you get correct instant values on your wrist . Naveen Jain",4
Good one...Till today no problem,4
"I am writing this review just after 48 hours of use of this product!
Since I have purchased a smart fitness band first time I was not very much familiar with its usability but my experience with mi band 5 is overall good.
The pairing process is quite easy, steps counting is quite accurate but sometimes it picks up 50-100 false step counts when I travel on a vehicle, heart rate sensor works well and the stress level calculation is a nice feature to keep a watch on high stress levels which could lead to severe illnesses,relaxed breathing feature is very good to control our high stress levels, screen resolution and brightness level is excellent no visibility issue in broad daylight, notifications come instantly and you can read whatsapp as well as other messages on the band itself.
So far a nice fitness band/smart watch for the budget conscious user.
The only improvements I feel could be done are battery life decreased from 100%-75% in two days only with continuous heart rate monitoring which may last for 6-7 days but it should be at least 10 days and the font size is very small which makes it difficult to read messages.",4
It's easy to setup and install,4
Range could have been better,4
"Excellent product by Xiaomi in this range,
Calling notification is very useful, when u r on bike, unlimited watch faces (with third party app)",4
"The headphones quality and sound is really good, using them for my music production for almost a couple of months, it is a bit tight and gets a little uncomfortable to wear for wearing them for more than 30 min, but great ones...",4
Easy to install and use. Printing cost is less and photo print quality is good. Good for home and office use if you are planning to have moderate usage. It is little slow in printing and also makes noise while printing.,4
Good to buy.,4
"Sound quality is superb but bass is little bit low
...but still a nice prduct i m satisfiyed.",4
"Watch is best at this price range, all functions work properly. I wore the watch for long hours and now i got some kind elergy on my hand, dont want to blame the company, maybe the strap is not suitable for me. I replaced the plastic strap with third party metalic strap and now it suits good for me.",4
Nice Product for the cost....,4
Product is excellent but Abhi tk 10% caseback Nai mila hai,4
Best product of redmi 9A,4
Very super quality sound experience and quality product,4

Thank you Amazon for fast delivery my review after three days I fully charged the battery after three days it has still 79% percent remaining foot steps is accurate touch is descent weather updates fast time view sensor is very accurate one thing I dont like is range of bluetooth is not very good I would say 12 steps away you won't get notification on your smart watch rest is good.,4
Better for use and battery but low storage,4
Best product worthly..best all round quality product,4
"Good product but if oxygen saturation is added it would be much better.

Also number of steps accuracy needs to be improved.",4
Watch is good but need to improve a lot on app,4
"Good quality..worth for money...just one thing is missing is the additional strap n screen protector if provided...
Noise always provide us the best with quality.
every thing work smoother n easy handling...

Nice product at this range. The sound quality is not bad. It is good for bass music as well.,4
Really super smart watch and comfortable to wear...,4
"As the heading suggests, a small and compact ups which works perfectly for a modem / router.

I got this in September 2018 and as of December 2020, it's dead, meaning, it does not support the wifi router for even a minute after power outage.

The thing is, I've been noticing some issues from a few months with my wifi during a power outage but I didn't think it's this UPS as the generator in my apartment kicks in very soon sometimes.

2k ever 2 years looks kinda expensive. Maybe worth swapping the batteries, if you have that skill.",4
Great stuff. Totally worth the money. Cant expect more in this price bracket. Thanks to Cloudtail for good packaging and fast delivery. Got in 2 days here in Kolkata.,4
Excellent with respect to cost of 300 to 400. Fitting in ear some time an issue but manageable.,4
"The base is not quite good but for a under INR 1k purchase, the vocals, mids and the highs come out very very clear and I loved it. Just don't expect a excellent bass and treble response.",4
Look n quality nice,4
Battery üîã pickup is good than other smart hand üñê watch,4
One disadvantage it do not allow to pick up phone,4
Sound quality is better but the bass is not sufficient,4
Likeüëçüëçü§ü,4
Sim placement in a removable cartridge is not a sturdy design.,4
"At this price range, I didnt expect a lot out of the earphones with so many options around 500-600 range. If you are looking for budget earphones, no need to shell out additional 200 bucks.. These earphones have good bass range.. Noise cancellation is good..",4
Excellent product. Worth for money. You can print from anywhere using cloud printing.,4
In that price mobile is best ü•≥,4
Product quality is good but picture and pixel quality can be improved.,4
Call and for listing muaic and its sound quality is very good it is very useful for my business Purpose,4
"Touch screen is good, but not accurate sleep tracking
Daily morning noise application open our phone then call and massage notification rather than not notified.",4
2 printers sent I want to return one printer,4
Value for money. Made in India product. Quality of Samsung brand. Can avoid other Chinese alternatives.,4
"Product is absolutely good but long time it's paining on years ...it's smooth for touch but it's tight on ears.
Other than that the product is absolutely good.",4
Super headphone by sony.treble & bass is good.but not for heavy bass lovers.good quty wires & pin.very combrtable to wear bcz size is big.if it suits me it will suit anybody.vol is low but sound qu√†lity is good.it easily fit in mi phones,4
Watch is pretty good but accuracy of heath parameters not accurate.,4
Looking good but didn't used yet.,4
Its a useful product....value for money,4
"Everything is good except the battery life. It stays up to 5 days.. Apart from this, I love this..",4
"It take more time for charge battery more than 2 hours. In gaming, it is a wonderful gaming phone Helio G85.

Disadvantage : camera both have not good 48 MP camera is also average camera not good or not bad. Front camera 13 MP is low if your photo is nearest to you then good but if you in more distance landscapes of behind your face then good capture",4
Display is just awesome... Feels good in hand,4

"Upgraded from Mi Band 2 to Mi Band 5.
This band is very good.

1. Lots of watch faces
2. Superb Touch Screen and good response
3. Heartrate is accurate
4. Stress feature is good to have.

Only 2 problem it have

Otherwise very good purchase and fast delivery.",4

But not to confertable, afert 20 to 30 minutes Ear ache was started.",4
Product is fine for the price. Do not expect a lot as there is vibration noticed when you increase the volume. Bluetooth connectivity was questionable as both my android and iOS fails to connect complaining about incorrect PIN or passkey. But I raised a request online and received a call almost immediately from Zebronics. The issue is fixed! Appreciate the support,4
The sound quality is very poor..with a 27 inch screen.. one sits a bit away.. however I have to use external speakers to listen..the in built speakers are very poor.. very low sound in spite of keeping at max level,4

Sleep tracking is very poor and touch screen laggy and mobile app is good,4
It is valuable for this price but consumers too much of ink,4
Not very good quality bass but it works fine.The sound is a little less. Good product at this price. You can order if u don't want to use it daily and u r not much of a music lover.,4

Wire Quality could have been better. But considering it‚Äôs price sound quality is pretty good.,4
Amazing product,4
Good but can be used to extend only to a very small area. Say if the router is in a room wifi can be used in the next room. Not more than that. It is worth buying only to cover a small area.,4
Easy to use. Only some extra work for change wifi name and password reset and customer care not pick you phone...,4
if you want a wifi router having above 300mbps speed you can go for it without any doubt....quality of the product is really very good...signal strength is also good...installation process is also very easy... I think it is one of the best single band 450mbps wifi router.,4

Amazing sound clarity,4
"I received Goqii smart Vital and Goqii weighing scale from my office as a Diwali gift.

The Goqii tracker has become a basic necessity to track my health on-the-go.

The SPO2 levels and heart rate I find quite accurate. The BP levels are not very accurate.

The best feature for me is the Goqii app - I make maximum use of it. It feels amazing to have a personal coach and the newly added Pro classes are just too good. I love the morning yoga sessions.

The weighing scale is great too. It has a lot of features. It keeps my weight in check and automatically syncs it with the app for my coach to see. Very convenient.

The design is good, sleek and it serves my purpose.

I live my tracker.",4
"Everything is great abut this headphone
Except the quality of AUX cable
Worst cable
The cable was similler to a toy car's wire",4
More Pen Glucose Strips.Good purchase...Working fine..,4
Slight touch getting hang,4
Nice product. Good bass and treble both balanced. Nice product to buy if you are on a budget.,4
Good product but seems to be used one,4
Bluetooth is not functioning sometimes,4
I really like it,4
"Good one, battery capacity good, no super bass its okay and good for thia price",4
The best feature of the Smart Watch is analysis of exercise weekly and monthly with graphic presentation. However the BP measuring apparatus and system is much to be desired.,4
"Sturdy build. Good finishing. Friendly LED indicators placed on top of the router body which is a weird location for the indicators unless you look from the top. Has good amount of ventilation openings on top and bottom.
Technically, very easy to setup with broadband connection and configuration of the dual band Wifi is very simple. The signal is stable and strong, even at a medium power setting for the 5GHz band. If you have a 100Mbps connection, it easily delivers a throughput of ~95Mbps over Wifi which is actually very good. Supports HD Streaming and Video Calls over Meet and Teams in parallel without any issue.",4
Good buy at d price point...Won't regret...This is the 2nd pc at home...wiring give away after some time...,4
"It's good but need to handle with care, if u planning for regular use then this is not ideal head phone i use only once and now I don't wanna use daily cause I am scared I might break",4
"good one.Good product .cheap and best
Everbody want this",4
"The reason I bought it was because it has many watch faces which we can choose from.

Heart rate sensor is fairly accurate which I have cross checked with my Electronic BP monitoring machine.

Battery life is decent as it can go on 20 days easily on average use if you don't use heart rate sensor on a continuous basis.

Connectivity is good and it doesn't lose connection on its own.

Step counter and activity tracker I have not checked thoroughly but I can say that step counter is not very accurate.

Vibration feedback is good too.

The only drawback is that Amoled Screen of Mi Band 4 is not at all visible in bright sunlight and you will not able to see what is displayed on screen. Though Indoor Screen visibility is very good.

Rest all features like notifications are shown on the band immediately as it is shown on phone itself without any delay.

Hope I have been able to address most of your queries.",4
Everything about this headphone is amazing...but the build up could've been better...the folding part freaks me out like every time I fold it I get the cracking sound.... otherwise there are no flaws with this device...you can go for it with closed eyes,4
Good mobile application and touch screen,4
Overall good product.Little bit meshy noise when you use the earphones while call but on media consumption it is on point.,4
The person came for installation was interested in selling optical digital cable only.,4
"Starting with the pro's after 2 weeks of usage, sleep tracking is spot on, heart rate and spo2 is also accurate, steps counter is pretty o.k, the app is highly draining your smart phone battery, so has to keep it off and on it whenever you are using it only.
The biggest con is the battery, the battery do not stay for 14 days as claimed, with full range of usage permitted the battery does not last even for 3 full days, so keep it in mind before purchasing.",4
"Vary wrost product, waste of money, cartridge ink finished within 15 days and unable to refill it, refilled but not getting actual colour. Very bad product. Not expected such thirdclass quality for HP",4
Good product in this price.fastest delivery.camera quality is good.,4
"1. Size adequate for head
2. No ear pain

4.BASS is even better.

I had ordered at 799 and next day it was 749 , cancelled old and purchased at 749.",4
Nice product in 2500/- overall satisfied,4
"Laptop has everything you need..Its a complete package.

i like it",4
Its an excellent moniter i ever had,4
"Using this bud for past 2 days. I find it good and value for money under 2k if you are lucky to get a non defective piece.

They fit well in ear. Mic is good. There is passive noise cancellation so don't expect much. Touch controls are good but work with a bit of delay.

Coming on to the sound, if you like strong bass then these buds are not for you. They give crips and clear output which can be optimised using Dolby Atmos.

Battery backup is quite good. Case is super delicate need to be very cautious with it.

My right bud have some issue. After battery drops 60% or below it give buzzzzz sound when nothing is playing which is annoying.

Edit 1 (22Nov2020): It is now 2 weeks I am using these earbuds. Here is a quick review:
Overall rating: 4/5
Build quality of case and buds: 4/5
Battery life: 4/5
Sound quality: 4/5
Noise cancellation: 3.5/5
Touch gesture: 4/5
Customer support: 4.5/5

I liked the crips and clear sound. It have 13mm driver but still misses on thumping bass. Don't get me wrong overall they have quite balance sound. One last improvement area - making touch gesture respond fast.

Before I close my review, I must say Noise customer support is quite responsive. They do follow up on call, emails, and whats app. Quite happy with the support I received with my faulty buds.

Overall I am satisfied with the product at the price I got it. Thank you noise :)",4
Battery backup is amazing and overall these headphones worth the price of 1399 RS,4
Money worth....,4
I liked the wallpapers pattern style . Dislike is battery percentage is not shown in the watch,4

"Pros:
1. Lot of watch faces available
2. Lots of different workout modes added
3. Magnetic charging
4. Sleep monitoring, Stress monitoring, Continous heart rate monitoring
5. Screen is little bigger and looks good

Cons:
1. Strap feels thinner than band 4
2. Some watch faces from store looks dull on screen

Update : Worth the money..Accuracy is far better than band 4.. Battery backup is excellent..After more than 5 weeks of usage still have 26 percent left without continuous monitoring.. Need to check with monitoring ON also..",4

Sound quality good no doubt but Volume level is very low u can't hear on 15 20 minimum sounds cum up on 25 and 30 majaor Subwoofer sound is less compare to other products. This is what I felt but in this budget is nice deal. üëç",4
cartridge drains faster better to buy some other,4
"To be honest, no other product in this budget will defeat this.
1. It has a good bass
2. Noise cancellation is OKAY, don't expect much at this cost
3. Durability is also OKAY.",4
"Very good quality ear phones for shoe string budget.

Bought these primarily for calls etc , but now I am ending up using these more often than my music specific headphones / ear phones.

Made from sturdy durable material , 3.5mm pin in steel tipped (not gold) and the speaker containers are plastic.
Yet , it delivers rich bass and very good audio quality on calls.

Comfortable for long time use on ears too.

It's very good bang for the buck.",4
I have been using jbl c100si for 1 year and the sound quality is just awesome.. Great lows mids highs.. and Superb Bass. It has crystal clear sound. And blocks noise from your surroundings.,4

I am writing this review after using this product for 6 month.",4
Worth one.....,4
"Great watch
Must buy..üëçüëç",4
Healthy bass and dynamic effect but channel separation is not very clear. Build quality is good. Recommended for the price.,4
"Nice product. Works fine even with local network connections, no brand networks required. Range provided by the router is very good. Buy this product without a second thought. Great for this price. Only negative point about this product is that, the product does not have ON or OFF switch.",4
Nice for budget buyers. USE FOR 8 - 9 MONTHS,4
Good one at this price,4
Its worth of money at Rs 399. But there's humming sound in left ear set. And buds quality isn't that good.,4
"I Buy this product from local store. at a cost of Rs.4500/. in this cost i think this is the best 2.1 Home theater.
Pro: 1) Deep bass quality. 2) clear sound. 3) Great Bluetooth connectivity.
Cons: 1) the tower speaker wear is too short. and no wall mount option
** there is auto bass control. when you increase the volume the base adjust automatically",4

Gud phone at this price range.That was for my mom.She loved it..,4
"At this price range, this is a brilliant product. Although i won't really say that this is the best monitor for gaming, but it does a good job. This monitor would be more suitable for regular office work as it has a comfortable viewing experience for longer usages, and that's also my primary usage",4
Excellent sound clarity and bass but you feel pain over the ear after a continuous listening due to pressure on ears. Very much affordable.,4
Like this product,4
Bass is pretty weak but you get what you pay for.,4
"A 3rd gen Ryzen, GTX 1650Ti( GDDR6 ), 8 GB Ram, 512GB storage and an full HD screen, If these are the primary specs you want in your Laptop this
laptop has got you covered in 50-55k range.
This laptop is good for gaming on medium settings and a little bit of light editing. Thermals are good depending on usage, my usage is limited to only for ms office work, some photo editing on photoshop and little bit of coding. In a day2day usage this laptop has everything. The side bezels are thin which I got used to. A little bit heavy for carrying around. And also it has an expansion slot for ram.

But there are some minor things which I couldn't ignore :
1.Battery:
Only 48 Whr 3-cell battery for this power hungry machine is not enough which lasts only 3-4hr for heavy workload like photoshop. So use it with a charger.

2.No fingerprint:
Most of options are offering fingerprint sensor so it would have been better. But in the competition only this one is offering 1650Ti which is better imo.

3.Ryzen5:
Its been almost a year since Ryzen 4000 series was lunched but still those are nowhere to be found and those which are available are out of budget range and not worth the bang for the buck so this is only left good but could be better.

4.No accessories included(at least a laptop bag or a sleeve case would be good).

5.No dedicated lights for numlock, capslock(there is a software for that). Really annoyed didn't expected this.

Overall this one is a great value for money laptop because of specs it is offering and also acer is little underrated compared to hp and Dell which are overpriced and not value for money in comparison.",4
"Value for money.
Good product in such price range.

Not good for selfie people. As you can get a better product by adding 2-3 k more in mobile.",4
Looks is good. Easy to carry. But signal frequency not so good. But in budget friendly product. Overall product is good ‚ù§Ô∏è,4
I bought a 2Gb/32Gb variant. For the price its an amazing phone. One star minus for the camera.,4

Build quality is good... Looks premium.
UI is good but could have better.
Battery back up is good.. 3 days if connected to mobile on day time... 4-5 days if not connected to mobile...
Watch can properly communicate to mobile only through zep app.
Call cannot be attended through watch can reject, silence or reject with sms.
Big drawback is that it can only store 2 watch faces since its internal storage is poor.
We have to over write watch face every time we install new watch face.",4
"It has Simple and elegant design,and best performance",4
"Except rear camera ,everything is good with this price",4
Till now it's working fine. Need to check the life. Using from 1month.,4
I advice you to buy it from Goqii app in less than amazon price you will get the watch as well as face mask and a good quality backpack. Great deal there,4

Only 3 default watch faces all the time",4
"I know you guys must be wondering why my review title says ""Dont buy"" but I have given 4 star rating to this product. It's because this product comes with a 16A 150V power adapter. In usual cases we do not have 16A power output available to work with monitors. So please make sure you have 16A 250V plug point available. I had to purchase separate power cord to work with this monitor. Also, in the description it was not mentioned that it requires higher volt output plug which was a conflict because the product was not returnable only exchangeable.",4
Battery is getting discharged quickly,4
Just great. Product is as described. Its packaging cover differs 4rm the global version though (black & white case). Got me really confused and suspicious at first. In india it comes in an orange and white box.,4

"After 6 months of buying this, i feel this product was a very good choice. Amazon delivered as promised. I used this on BSNL ADSL connection first since i had that line initially, works like a charm, no issues. Then because BSNL's very disgusting service, we then opted for an optic fibre service provider, Ethernet Xpress. At first i was disappointed as dlink's customer care informed that this device won't work with the fibre service as the fibre n/w service required a router and not a modem+router. Anyhow i got hold of some workarounds and configured the device to work with the fibre n/w service. Works like a charm now.",4

 This is our 1st printer.

We ordered this on 6th August early morning - it got delivered same day late evening. Product packaging was very nice and compact - didn't contain any Amazon packaging - only Canon's packaging - however, it was quite well packed. We had to sanitise every part of it and self-installed it - didn't face any hassle - watched 3 vids on YT.

We had ordered Easy JK copier A4 packs with the printer, whose quality was below avg. The drivers and s/w apps on the CD are quite handy. However, colour ink quality on print (as you can see in the attached pic) is very dull and average. However, if you print from fresh Word doc that you create, the colours are coming better. Black ink is satisfactory - toner saving ink feature works as well. Tested with image garden - working cool as well.

Haven't checked with photo paper >75GSM - so will update about it once the photo papers are delivered.

There ""may be"" a setting where the colour quality can be improved - haven't checked that yet - however default quality is not that good.

PROS:

1. Awesome packaging and same-day delivery
2. 3 black ink bottles (1 default 2 extra) and 3 colour (C,M,Y)
3. Price was INR 8499 with Prime Day and HDFC card's 10% discounts (quite good for the less price per page it offers)
4. I printed 346 papers so far, don't find any drop in black ink level. Zero. Will print more papers and review price per page.
5. Colour paper print is considerably fast (9-10 secs)
6. Colour o/p quality of colour photocopy is brilliant and crisp - not so for printout - bizarre, but true
6. Installation is pretty easy and straight forward
7. LCD display for easy detection of printer readiness
8. It needs a 2-pin power port, not a 3-pin.

CONS:

1. Colour ink output quality is not up to the mark (tested with 75 gsm paper), can be better
2. No Wi-Fi connectivity - so printing from mobile or PC in another room is a hassle
3. No auto-duplex - you need to manually flip the paper lot with manual duplex and time consumption is x2
4. B&W print doesn't work without both B&W and colour ink fed to chambers
5. Extremely noisy - can hear the noise literally from a room with door shut 15 ft away
6. When main chamber is lifted (for ex, to check internal components in action), printout is paused
7. LCD display reading is stagnant at 1, not showing paper count (maybe a change in setting needed)
8. Black paper print is slower than mentioned in Amazon listing (8-9 secs)
9.

MY VERDICT:

My priority and key factor for purchase decision has been maintenance cost and thus I found this printer very helpful and rated it 4/5 stars. I can live with all its cons as long as it doesn't break down all of a sudden for no fault of the user after 3 months, so to say. As per ISO standards, paper cost is Re. 0.08 per page (B&W) and Re. 0.12 (per page colour) - good for someone who prints 200-400 booklets (once or twice in a month).

However, if you're buying one for rare home usage, I'll suggest you go for lower models but with Wi-Fi connectivity and auto-duplex feature that are extremely handy and essential (maybe ink-advantage models). But do buy this model if you need to print lots of papers at short intervals and don't need to use it from PCs in multiple rooms remotely. Noise is more than I expected, but definitely less than those copiers in local print/copy shops.

Hope you found this review useful for your next purchase!",4
The camera is totally outstanding for beginners with reasonable price.,4
Sometimes it is uncomfortable...and little bit hard,4
Purchased in March 2016 for my Bsnl landline broadband.was using bsnl rented Nokia-siemens modem before. Initial Setup was bit tricky but managed myself with the support CD.sometime I feel that the Wi-Fi speed is slow when connected to laptop compared to my old modem. It doesn't heat much. WiFi on off button is a good feature.,4
It‚Äôs been 2 weeks that we r using it...it‚Äôs really gud,4
great experience with this phone,4
"Really awesome band
Build quality is uncompromisable ,
Touch and performance also too.
After 7 days band use 10-15 % percentage is going per day if the notification and map is enable. So if u want to purchase this band think twice before buying. Actually it's a waste of money. It's gets only 9 days battery backup.",4
"That 4th light you see is the internet connection light, and it's getting dim.... Which is sad cuz it's important.

I asked for a replacement.
Got one just now.
Now there is no noise, it works fine.
Rest let's see after a few days usage.",4

Boat earphone.Am hearing some songs in this headset I can feel travelling with boat,4
"This is the best fitness tracker for this budget.
The ergonomic design of the band is very comfortable and you almost forget that you're wearing it apart from the occasional brushes against any surface which might lead to it getting some scratches on the screen which is a scratch magnet. The display is pretty good and is visible clearly in the sun. The wakeup feature of band has a little delay from when we lift up our arm but not really a problem. The sleep tracking feature of the band is very accurate and I like the detailed analysis on the sleep it gives in the app. I am using galaxy active fit 2 and I like this band better as the former one has some serious glitches. All in all this is a worthwhile purchase and very sturdy. The glass quality could be made better though and the band isn't very breathable.",4
The phone is big...the Color is not white...it's a graded colour of upper white and lower sky blue..doesn't suit for people taking serious jobs...it's funky junky...the case given is transparent if u don't like the colour u can put a coloured case so that no-one can see it's colour...I still haven't figured how to add space between words while messaging and adding contacts,4

Good print quality till today from last year,4
Affordable with great quality.,4
Nice product I like it,4
Though good it doesnt come with volume button like my previous ones. I didnt check before buying but I've always had ones with the volume control button so I expected it. Otherwise all good I am no music expert. But sound is not a problem. So all in all not bad.,4
Watch is good accurate well built. Also stylish. Though sleep tracking is little bit off and not precise.,4
"Product good.
Software installation not very easy",4
Good router for the price,4

"Brightness management is best but still there are some tiny issue that you can ignore because of this price. Otherwise this monitor is just great according to its price range and I'm using this from last 2 months now.

I will update here if I will face any issues.",4
Price variation is very high.,4
Print quality very beautiful price money very small,4
I am using this watch for over 1 week now and the watch is really doing a decent job!! and in daily usage I feel like the watch is really good for your fitness apart from battery because the battery can last give you upto maximum 4 to 5 days not more than that because I only charge the watch for over 2 times in this week but I should say that this watch is seriously very very accurate plus it also look so stunning on hand!!üòã You should go for this watch under 4k!!,4
worth the money.. does not look cheap also.. good for ladies,4
Great product in such a low cost but not so good for calling purpose.,4
Great screen if u can go for it jst do it ‚úåÔ∏è,4

Value for money",4
Best mobile at low price,4
"It doesn't tracks sleep during daytime, so ig you're doing night shifts you aren't sleeping according to it.
Step tracking isn't accurate, if you shake hands sitting on chair it senses a walk and step-counts.
Not the best in some aspects.
But thumbs up for the battery life.",4
Nice product and affordable.Snapdeal offers best prices,4
Not as good as boat. The sound quality is similar to boat but material and durability is not upto the mark. Though the price is real cheap.,4
"laptop is good and budget friendly but it needs more stable performance it feels some time very laggy.
need more updates to improve",4
price and item doesnt not match not worth for money,4

Ear volume is too low,4
Looks nice.. bought it today..,4
good quality print. but connectivity issues arises sometimes. capability to be added as a network printer. hp service is real good. when a problem occurred to the scanner they came and changed the scanner assembly. 1 disadvantage is the printer ink is costly and it will be finished very fast.,4

Really good. Thinking to buy? Just go for it..,4
Value for money......,4

As I used this product and was fantastic to to access it. pls try it,4
"Great product in this price range. Activities and health monitoring is perfect. The size comparatively small as I thinked but it is fine. I found only one problem in this watch that the music control is not working properly.
But in this price,it is value for money.
Go for it.",4
Overall experience is nice. I m satisfied with this earphone. The bass is nice. Noice cancellation is also decent.1 think that i don't like is that the wire. U hv always worried about the tangle wire.,4
Bass Quality Is Awesome,4

The picture quality is so nice,4
"For the price 500rs, best in the market

Good product. Working fine for over a month by now.,4
Good Phone under 10k,4
Don't buy this as it cannot be daisychined with another P2419H model. Otherwise the monitor is good.,4
"All over best phone to buy at this price range.

*Speaker sounds like good but volume is not so loud
*Weight is little bit heavy.",4
"Product performance on Bluetooth is excellent. Sound and Bass quality are also good but, the surround speakers are not that much effective, which was expected. Very low volume is heared from surround speakers even after raising volume by to 12 (full).",4
Good Battery life & Camera,4
"Sleep tracking not accurate, touch is good, ui is good.",4
Application hang many times..,4
"soound quality is ok, bass is also ok not too much, mic is not so good, you need to speak veey loud to make other hear you properly. it justify its price so can go for it",4
Good in price range but if u love camera goto another model,4
"- Good battery life
- Great comfort to ears
- Max volume is bit on the lower side
- ANC works decently",4
Good Quality band but bad battery life... does not even last for 1 week. Charging also takes more than 2 hrs to charge... once the band charge goes below 15% it will not perform accurate results.,4
Bluetooth connectivity is good,4
Nice router in this segment,4
Good home camera with excellent night vision,4
nice monitor at this price.Very good choice for software developers as additional monitor for laptop. You can split the screen using onscreen control.,4
"As per me, i like thin design, but if ur buying go for 24"" for if 1080, if u need 27"" get 1920 or 4k, dont get 27"" 1080... But budget wise if u need 27"" n if u sit far for watching movie and all its fine...",4
Really useful product. Especially to persons working from home.,4
"It's been about a month that I'm using the printer and have printed about 140 pages. My reviews are based on the usage in this short period. Hope this helps.

Use: Printer is good for normal home use.

Pages/cartridge: With the cartridges supplied, one can print just about 40 pages (not 100 as mentioned/advertised).

Cost of printing: If cartridges are replaced each time, the cost of printing is too high (something like 19/- per page for b/w). Simply refilling the ink is far economical.

Printing quality: On printing quality, it's better than average. As mentioned, good for home use. Print in draft mode. For pages <= 70 GSM, printing back-back is not advisable. It's traces are visible on the rear page as well.

Printing speed: It prints slightly slow, this being an ink-jet. That's fine and expected.

Features: Prints, Scans and Copies. This is kind-of basic model, so no features such as automatic double-side printing. That's known and is fine. It goes well when more than one page is placed in the feeder. With a single page, it needs to be inserted in the slot till the end below, which isn't easy...and the page usually get's stuck while printing. It's advised in the manual to use multiple pages in the feeder (manual is not a part of the product...to be searched/downloaded online).

Handle with care: Parts are delicate, need to handle with care (especially while removing cartridges to refill).

Overall: At this price, it's good to have.",4
Too good as usual no comment from on fell.. but me bit unhappy as it‚Äôs mfg. at China,4
It's easy to install. Getting good WiFi signal.,4
"Awesome Features under 11k, Redmi providing great budget mobiles, but they have to work more on Camera. After all, I'm Happy",4
"To be honest, after a very rough use of 2 month, I believe this could be the best earphones in an affordable price. Go for it.. still, it gives the same sounds as new one..",4
It's just awesome .....In this price u will never catch with other,4
Price worthy product,4
"I would like to say that it was very easy to install the printer and it's easy to use it. However, I would like to mention that the ink is not too much and after 120 pages it's not possible to print out any document with a high quality. Anyway, it's a good product for personal use. If you want to buy something for office, I don't recommend this printer because it's made for personal and domestic use. It's an all-in-one made for home. Good product!",4
Works like a charm,4
I like it after replacement. First they gave me used me monitor.,4
Good product... with average sound quality ... flexible light weight ... according to price.... satisfied.,4
"Bettery life very good, camera also nice nd screen quality too very nice.
Totally very good handset
üòç",4
The WiFi is working very satisfactorily and I am pleased with the supply.,4
"This product is good and quality is ok, but the watch faces is limited. Connecting with application is bad.",4
Product is good but it's chinese...but wrongly printed on box.,4
This mobile phone is very osm and value of money but camera pixel size is normal and camera shooting pic is not good.,4
"Good quality sound especially when volume is low.. strong built..
Person near can realise which song is being played.. Bluetooth connectivity is good..
However returned as my Sony Bravia tv is 2015 version which doesn't support Bluetooth headphones...
Bit costly product.",4
Its nice compact and good looking but one thing that should be improve is its watch faces.. It has bad watch faces..,4
Good to use for home WifI under low speed,4
"I use this product for my startup, the product is perfect for the price range. Nice product for the starters",4
"Only one feature which is missing is phone answering. Exept this it's every feature is worth. Good quality strap, responsive screen, attractive watch faces( updation of newer faces is slow).And look altogether is fascinating.",4
"Good looking with 5ATM and fitness tracker makes this watch a perfect fit for the user and the amazon delivery was fast though without prime.
But when used spo2, measurement failed on several occasions
But it could have been better.",4
"Great value for money. Really liked the quality of sound and materials. Connects seamlessly to mobile bluetooth. Touch controls are very sensitive, it took a bit of time to get used to it. Once get used to it, it's very handy to control volume, play/pause, forward/rewind, etc. Overall liked the product and happy about the purchase",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Got this watch today. Looks pretty decent.Good for ladies to keep track of their cycle, very thoughtful of the makers for introducing this particular feature. It has the most no of Activity modes. 60 to be precise, it's going to be a Giant Killer among GOQI. Noise. Mi revolve and others, other than the build quality, or can stand upto an apple watch. Spo2 and pai features are rarely to be used. It dsnt have in-built GPS which is kinda OK. You anyways carry your phone. Do compare it with Honor GTS the one which is being sold at arund 6k and then decide. Bip U has lots and lots of watch faces to choose from. Its v light in weight. Vulnerable to scratches. Plastic/polycarbonate is case is the only negative so far.",4
"Good for ears, noise cancellation is ok. Wired connectivity much better than Bluetooth.",4
Best for talking over the phone. No ear pain at all.,4
"Camera üì∏ not gud
Battery üîã Good
Good performance",4
I can't able to get the radio station unwanted station are there,4
Good sound quality but mediocre noise cancellation. Premium build.,4
Overall a good phone at this price range,4
"Okay
I am reviewing after using this for 30 days of use.

Sleep Accuracy is not efficient it gives 90% correct data but I am not happy with 10% of inaccuracy as it counts sleeping even when you are just laying down in night and watching movies

Step count is accurate like 98%

Heart Beat count sometimes when you intentionally try to read the activity it fails also happens with Stress and Spo2 count

Overall good 3.5/5 as it fails when I try intentionally by following the instructions.

Battery life is 7 days I charge it on every Tuesday from past 3 weeks as it drains out completely on Tuesday
I can say I light up the screen for around 30-40 mins a day and heart rate count is enabled by default on 30 mins setting",4
I like it go for it,4
Good product. But got little costly üòÖ,4
"Nuce Base
Good cinnectivity, lenght of wire not expected.
Bluetooth is good",4
Battery 5 days running,4
"This monitor performs as well as my old samsung monitor but I'm disappointed with the power cable. It came with 16A big cable. I can't use it anywhere in my room. I have this 16A socket only in the kitchen. Now what do I do with it? If you plan to purchase this monitor, beware of this problem. You will have to buy an extra power cable from a computer shop nearby which would cost around Rs 200 or you have to connect it to an AC power socket if available or fix a new 16A box nearby your pc or get a 6A to 16A converter socket(Very unsafe ). When I tested this monitor with my watt meter, it measured only about 19W in movie mode with best brightness. I really wonder what the design team were thinking when they have decided to use a 16A plug which can carry over 3000W power when our requirement is only 19W power.",4
"Great price, great product",4
This is good watch in this range,4
Good for its price,4
"guys the cable is a new type of hdmi which won't connect, you'll have to purchase a hdmi cable separately or a VGA cable for ur use",4
Battery Backup.backup minimum  1 30 hour,4
I was expecting more range from this route. Initially I was having single band router but after installing it only 1 single bar raised in my house corners. Built is string and easy install.,4
"Good product worth for the price, quality of sound, bass is good, cool design, noise cancellation is okay for the price of the product.",4
"Good printer under 2000. Good design, light weight. But as expected printing speed is slow as it is inkjet printer .",4
"Grt deal..best 5g mobile under 20k
Fine camera,grt screen and display, big battery and so on...",4
Brought this phone in exchange offer.. Completely satisfied.. Good phone under 10k budget.. üëç,4

"Have been using this product for around a month. Doing fine. It gives you everything as claimed by manufacturer. Accuracy also seems ok. However, you don't have much support from the App. If they improve the features of App to give you as much information as any other Apps on the Play Store, I think they can be much ahead of others with their existing features of the App.",4

"Compact, easy to setup, low price",4
The sound is crystal clear with good highs but the noise cancelation is not as good as advertised. Needed this primarily for taking calls but the surrounding noise makes it tough to hear the other person. Also the mic is way too low and you'll have to hold it in your hand.,4
It is not as good as other high end Mobile phones but at this price it is really a best buy,4
Works best with a dedicated equilizer..although decent sound for the money.,4
It is better in that price range,4
Best one to start with.,4
"Good modem at this price point.
The installation cd does not work.
Had to instal directly from browser.
The wireless conectivity is very good.",4
I already bought 150MBPS version of this and this one is as impressive as previous. 300MBPS version has slight increase in the range. The performance is absolutely amazing. I loved it for the price I grabbed it :P,4
Phone is good but camera quality is not good as compair to 48 mp camera,4
Printing is slow compared to laser printer,4
"Nice print, Difficult to configure wifi and has no Bluetooth connection",4
Nice product no any doubt,4
"Router overall seems good. But my earlier router Dlink DI 524 was similar. I was expecting improvement in range and stability. Range is marginally better but same as that of dlink for all practical purposes, as it keeps fluctuating.

Stability does not seem to be great either. At some locations, router configuration page would not open even when there is single bar range. At times my laptop is unable to connect to router but other devices could connect. I dont know who is at fault here, laptop or router. But overall performance is similar to Di 524, in spite of having two 5dbi antennas, with n band and all those jazz words. N band might help if LAN has significant traffic.

Configuration is simple and good. At some point of time advance features like, bandwidth control, WDS bridging or access rules would surely help.

Overall, dont fall for all the jazz words like 5 dbi antennas, dual antennas etc This may not be upgrade to your good ol router, so choose ONLY IF your old router has stopped working.",4
Monitor is really good in given price wished delivery would have been faster.,4
"Have been user if Noise product for long, this watch lived up to it. Firstly thanks to Amazon for on time delivery.

Watch looks primium, build quality is good, display can be better (should expect an upgrade on next model), battery is good and lives up to the committee timelines. Navigation on watch us easy and quite user friendly.

I was impressed by the app designed to sync this watch. It was easy, quick and very subtle.

Recommend for daily use.

Noise should consider making products in India and continue offering such good product at competitive prices.",4
"Best product. You can buy this product .
Only problem is that the screen is small. Please provide a large screen(full screen display).
Battery life is good as it stays up to 1 week without charging .

Awesome sound quality.. noise cancellation could have been better. Has been around 8 months.. moderate usage till date.,4
Superb product value for money but it could be better if sound and bass are little bit more and great coushinig soft feeling it is superb must buy and if boxing could also be better than the Browny old style box,4

"Everybody Has Written A Lengthy Review.
So, I'll Only Rate Every Spec. So You Can Decide On the Basis Of That.

Sound Quality - 4/5
Clarity - 4/5
Bass - 2/5
Noise Cancellation - 5/5
Loudness : 4/5

Overall, Bass Quality Was Good But Not Enough Fr Me, As I had used other Earphones Previously,Which Had Better Bass Than This one, But
Medium Bass Has One Benefit That Each and Every Sound Is Clear And Immersive.
So You Can go Fr It.üëç
Bass Lovers Check Other Options.",4
"Amazon Delivery was good.
Installation was done by Epson technician. He had to virtually strip down the brand new printer to fix some hardware issue due to travel from amazon warehouse to home.

Its working fine now. Can't really write about the performance as of today. But it is on expected lines. Tested it successfully wirelessly with iOS for iPad and Android devices.",4
Like it..Must Buy...,4
The headphone is very good. The bass is also really goog.....overall i will give rating 9 out of 10,4
"Its a good watch for the value, i felt sleep monitor and oxygen level is not correct. Not able to access voice facility yet. But rest all functions are good.",4
Giving 4 stars because range is not that great than other Dlink router at this budget,4
Build quality is good respect to price range. But bass is not there. Really the bass is very poor. But if you are a music lover with light bass and a crystal clear sound..just go for it.,4

Some time it is disconnected from the phone üòî,4
I purchased it for Rs 500. Good sound quality as per the price. You cant wear it for too long due to mild pain over outer ear. Otherwise its a good product,4
Its good ... But not superior as lg,4
"1. for adsl connection of bsnl it's good combination of router and modem.
2. for using it on ftth (fiber/ofc) of any service provider you need either ont/onu then you can connect this router and use it.
3. not support gpon/epon
4. for using sim you need net setter and you can connect it with this router(it has only one usb port).",4
Quality is not good like aold stock type.,4
"Printer is good. Easy to set up without tech support. We haven't had to call tech support sice we bought it. Happy with print quality. Was very useful during Covid times. We have printed multiple color copies ans photos but the ink level is still high. Definitely worth to have for home and small business purposes.
One small is that wifi has to be reenabled multiple times. It doesn't connect fast enough and stay connected.",4

very good router for landline connection bordband...,4
Very good headphones for the price I've paid. No voice cancellation and slightly very slightly sound distortion in mids is forcing me to take away one star... else the build quality over all sound and bass is emmaculat! I may add the held one star later as I get use to the mids. Highly recommend though.,4
These earbuds are a great deal in 2k. Work fine with I phone XR. Come in a super cute case and look quite similar to apple airpods. Does not look cheap at all considering the price. There is a slight lag in audio and video so can‚Äôt give it 5 stars but overall good deal. The best part is that these are super comfy and does not irritate the ear. You can wear these for long durations without even knowing. Just one suggestion to add a space for ventilation (similar to apple airpods) so that the space inside the ear does not get sweaty.,4
"I found this product as good quality. However, the mic quality should be improved little bit more.",4
"Useful for 2 BHK flat, Nice product",4
"Like things,but better items are available in local market at this price.",4

"Hi there,
If this is your 1st Bluetooth headphone, then go for it. Hands down this is a great headphone at this price point.
For people, who have used costlier headphones like Boat please don't go for this. You will be dissatisfied.

There are 3 modes:
1. BT mode : (mediocre)
2. SD card mode: (Best)
3. FM mode : (doesn't work at all)

The sound is quite loud and clear in SD card mode. Which proves that there is a 40mm driver.
However, in the Bluetooth mode the sound is feeble; it's more like a 30 mm driver in BT mode.
For normal users, it's not going to be a deal breaker.
But if you are music lover and want to buy this to use as a BT headphone then I suggest you reevaluate your options.",4
"As per my choice the best camera at its range !!
Bought it for 23000 on the summer sale!!",4
Sound quality is good. It's better to listen vocal music as it does have that powerful bass as compared to other headphones. I won't recommend this for Bass and EDM lovers!! But still in d end it's JBL!!!!,4
Just purchased it it‚Äôs good product sound is good . It‚Äôs good for hearing music but problem is that it don‚Äôt work that good for YouTube and gaming . I thing you should create some sort of companion app for it so that we could adjust it ourself otherwise it‚Äôs good,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I love it. The colour is awesome. And the sound quality is awesome too. I would highly recommend this green mint colour. Everyone notices it.",4
"Is ok, did its work",4
"The band is working well. This accuracy in this rate is really economically sounded well.
* Step tracking does not show the real data.
* Sleep tracking is a very good feature. It shows deep sleeping too. Sleep tracker won't work while we travel long distance in train
* Accuracy in heart rating is really awsome
* Design of watch is good, mi can provide better stylish shape according to my personal view.
* Light wieght, comfortable enough to wear.
* App has good features and many watch faces. I found some bugs in notify for mi band app.
* We can link it with google fitness app and some of third party apps
Over all, I am quiet happy with mi band 5.",4
In this price a good product,4
"These aren't the best ones I've bought but at this price range, what else could you expect? The comfort can be compared to oneplus wireless z though the tips are a little smaller. Overall the best budget buy for now.",4
"I've used the printer for almost a month now.
Quality is good, print colors and sca√± is good too.
Only issue is the info that came with the printer, yellow ink bottle was half empty..
Also, per page color printing cost the 50 times higher than what's mentioned",4
"Good Buy. Needs some software updates to fix some bugs in the mobile application. Also, it would be great to have more watch faces added.",4
Worth for money. Sound quality is good,4
"Reviewing after 1 month.
First few days were really odd. Then later on brain got habituated with it and ignored its presence.

Pros:
=========
- Battery power lasted for 29 days i.e. from full charge to 2%. In fact, I lost my charger somewhere, ordering a new charger.
- Colorful interface
- Getting a heads up on who is calling, Not to unlock mobile for OTP, Who is pinging on Whatsapp all I can do with a little rotation of my wrist. Yes, I am a first-time band user.
- Value for money. In 2.2k you will get Alarm, Timer, Stopwatch, Notification, Heart rate, Excercise logging, Wather, Find the mobile features. Though I expected GPS should have been there. However, that's fine.
- Water-resistant is a cool feature and no need to worry about driving in rain with the band on. Yet to try while swimming

Cons:
=========
- Sometimes lately after the call actually gets over, I am getting a notification on the band that someone is calling.
- I do not know how is it tracking my sleep. If I watch series after series while lying dead on my bed, it tracks that as I am sleeping.
- The strap could have been better designed. #MiBand5
- You can not live to track your activity (running, walking) over the mobile. You can only see after the activity gets over. Is it there to focus on the activity rather than peeping into mobile?
- It's hard to remove from the strap for charging. Do I need to read the manual? Do they have one?

That's it. I will recharge mine after my charger gets delivered and will update if anything else you may need to know.
Thanks for reading.",4
Very nice sound,4
"Speaker system is good. It is very nice in the price segment. Sound is not harsh but only drawback there is no bass control by speaker, though you can control by your app in you mobile if you playing music by Bluetooth. Please don't expect Instruments separation. You will listen instruments in your music but coz of overpowering bass you cant differentiate them. Rest is good. Keep in mind its what you getting for what you paying. Good for EDMs. If you are a serious music lover you can give a pass.",4
Great watch. Nice and sleek design and quite light weight as well. Product quality looks good along with battery life. Given 4 stars only bcoz i think GPS must have been there. Except that its a great buy. Value forMoney..,4
"Nice product have a grate sound quality and bass is owsome...,Very light weight and gental on ears",4
GOOD.,4
Very good product supar quality value for money,4
Satisfied with the product but please note that the product was not under proper packaging. Actually there was no Amazon packaging.,4
really good sound quality! BUT using the headphones for more than 20 mins results in aching ears...its because the ear pads are not soft and headphones are tight!!! NOT recommended for people with bigger shaped heads !!,4
User Friendly,4
Very good product,4
"Easily give 3-4 hours backup, easy to install, buy ‚ÄúY DC cable ‚Äú from Amazon itself. It will power modem and router both.

Nice earphone in this range. I would suggest everyone to buy this as it has very good sound quality. But the the build quality is quite satisfactory.,4
"I am writing this review after 22 days

First of all the battery life
It takes about 2 hrs to fully charge it
When u charge for üíØ percent of battery it easily long for min of 1 day on high usage
I used to attend online class for continuously for 7 hrs starting from 9 am morning to 4pm evening
In between i use whatsapp and Instagram often and also used to play PUBG for 1 hr in between break in evening after 4 i used to listen to music the @ 8 pm the battery will be nearly 15 percent..
So battery life good .

Next camera quality of it is good
Next fro playing pubg
It works flawlessly in HD graphics when went above i have very slight lag
Otherwise it's good

Display quality is very good
Also when continuously playing pubg i have abslight heating issue which is common in redmi phone
But nonthat extent

Conclusion : worth for money in this money segment .",4
Good sound quality. Most impressive feature that you can use Bluetooth after battery get low you can switch to wired jack pin to continue,4
Battery camera sab kuch behtar hai tach silver hai,4
Good for the price not that fast can't complain with price got for 20k,4
"Oxygen level not so accurate, Battery Life is good, BPM as said not so accurate, Sleep monitor works but not sure how good and you cannot wear the watch always as the Strap make's me feel uncomfortable and sticky, need a cotton strap, looks great, Stress level is a good add-on as I can control my self if I get hypertension,
As of now I am loving it, üëçüëçüëç",4
"Its met my expectation. Reach within the house (2000+ sft) from anywhere is good. Its good for taking calls. However, for songs or music, I wouldn't recommend it.",4
I have purchased at just Rs.6000 best in this range,4
Good phone at this price,4
"Value for money Smartphone.
Good in this price range for all specs display camera, display, battery, processor and other features.",4
Sound quality so nice.,4
Good bass but not very good as according to its brand.,4
OS is little bit slow,4
"Pros....
1) good sound .... can give all effects if you are playing PUBG on mobile....
2) Nicely connects Samsung models like J7,galaxy tab A 8 or auxus phone....
Con....
1) eats wax from your ear daily.... so good for your ear but... have to clean it daily ( as per your usage) on a softest cloth available in your home....",4
"Awesome router...i replaced my netgear with this. Working fine since last 1 month. Signal is very good around my home and i dont see any lag in data transfer. Very easy to configure and works as expected. I also added my 160 GB storage device with it. Now i am happily using it as my local fileserver at home. I am rating 4 here, as i expected the price to be few hundred less.",4
Bought this product after a recommendation from a friend and it works. What I liked the most was the ease of configuration. It has definitely improved connectivity within the house. The enhancement depends on what was the product you used earlier.,4

"Amazing watch. I got 2 of these pieces and dey r working absolutely fine, Infact i haven't stopped wearing it ever since. Keeps me updated on my SPO2 Level, Temperature, and the BP too. I found the BP readings to be quite okay. Not like how a medic wud do but gives a pretty fair idea. I definitely like it and looks like its gonna stay on my wrist for a while now!!",4
Sound quality should improve and product not working properly with lappy,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.

1) Thin bezels.

3) Good packaging and timely delivery.

Cons
1) Shaky stand. The screen vibrates even on the slightest of movement on the desk.
2) Screen is a little forward tilted and hence does not provide a good viewing angle. This won't be an issue for wall mounting.",4
good item.,4
"Needs full movement of arms to track steps, overall tracking of steps average.
Doesn‚Äôt have SPO2 meter,
Stress tracking needs person to be extremely stationary,
Sleep tracking average, nap tracking doesn‚Äôt detect naps.
Overall performance satisfactory for a budget band, advised to invest a little more and go for a professional performance basic band like Fitbit.",4

Everything is good. Battery life can be improved.,4
"Good product.. battery life is also good, looks is best.. regarding accuracy I still need to wait to check further...overall product is good..",4
It is wonderful and everything is so easy now with this..i must say it's worth buying..just that ink runs out at like 150-160 pgs for black and 100 pages nearly for color..nd that's where u get confused..nd u don't have to buy cartridge u can buy a ink refill kit nd u'll be good...‚ù§,4
"Installation was quite easy. I have cloned PC's MAC ID into the router.

Design is great looking. Range is more than sufficient for me, even though I'm using it on low power mode.
Temperature maintenance is great, can't feel any heat on the device's surface.

The indicator lights are rather tiny and dim. The light symbols are not readable from distance. You have to move withing 4 feet of device to tell which one is glowing.

Another thing I observed, if you turn OFF the WIFI from the admin webpage, then you can't turn it back ON using the physical button on the router. You have to do it again through webpage.

Prices have gone up in Corona year unfortunately and that's a bummer. This was almost 50% cheaper last year.",4
Sound is good. But right airbud sound is not working properly. I want replacement .,4
Headphone.Product was not fully functioning,4
Monitor is good but it has only one switch for adjustment of screen and put the screen off which is more inconvenient. As usual packing and delivery before promised date by Amazon is excellent,4
Kumar Was good with behaviour And was friendly tooo,4

Sometimes touch is not working properly. Battery backup is quite good. Design 10/10,4

Best product in money value.,4
Awesome phone camera nice colour nice all good üëç,4
"I ordered this product 10 days ago. I got a product which was of less bass. My ears started aching due to high volume. I felt annoyed and wanted complete refund. I spoke to customer care and they assured a replacement for another good unit. Today I got the replacement. Sound clarity is perfect. Bass quality is very good. Noise cancellation is good. They provide extra 2 pairs of rubber buds. And above all 1 complete year warranty. Can't expect more.

Guess what, I got it only at ‚Çπ250.

Totally worth Money.",4
Nice one.THIS ITEM IS TO GOOD,4
"I am writing this review after 1 month use ..Noise cancellation is awesome .. Bass is really Good ..
JBL quality is always Good ..
But the Only issue is that product is manufactured in China .",4
Signal is better than routers with single antenna.... Bandwidth is 300 mbps.... Enough to cover a 1500 Sq. Ft. House.... And the best product at this price!,4
Good Product...,4
"Product is good, but didn't receive the sim card ejector and it is made in china",4
"Value for money product. Best in this price range. Vocals are lil disappointing. It will feel lil tight on your ears but overall this is great.
Sound quality is ok ok for this price range.
After music is on you will not hear any external sound.
So noise cancellation is 6/10.
Blutooth connectivity is pretty good.",4

1. no rgb control

but its great its have separate mic and headphone cable with use for rgb,
work on phone if you can buy a connecter, its made for pc.
don't plug in the front i/o just as advise.
And if you have a hot head don't buy it because your ears gonna be sweaty as hell",4
best mobile phone in this range 4+64 in 9000 in these days best deal,4
"Decent sound quality, and i like the shape of the buds - don't like the ones that go right in and cut off all sound. cannot comment on noise cancellation since i did not want that feature at all. easy to operate and decent battery life. all in all value for money purchase",4
"I have been using it for just 3 days. Well, it has some really useful features like the workout modes and the menstrual cycle tracking.
I tested it with trade mill but it didn't track the date . It was getting paused every now and then. The newly added PAI seems like a good addition but I have little doubts about the accuracy. The step counting is almost accurate. You have a lot of watch faces to choose from. In short , the Mi Band 5 is good and you can go for it.",4
"For price less thn 500 go for it dont see 1,2,5star reviews check only 3&4 star reviews for any of the product u buy online bcz that are true reviews by users.
Now abt boat 100 earphn
Overall good for listening music ;in movies sound ;comfortable for long hours ; no pain in ear ; during sleep there is no pain while listening sleeping music when ear touched pillow u cant feel any pain; in overall expectations whatever u really want is 4 star.
Now what is bad let me tell that plus minus volume button u really miss during journey or in other case. While on using microphn u hve to pick it little up near ur mouth bcz its mic too much lower from ur neck.
Generally in all earphones upto 10k we se that at very higher & lower volume (say abv 12/15 or below 3/15) we have issue of treble & bass so let me tell this prblm is general in all earphones below 10k so for common people this is not so much big issue
The issue is at higher vol the earphn bass u r expecting is come with ""khar khar ""sound u feel like ur earphn vibrates too much unnecessary sound. And in very lower volume u do not feel any bass. In treble mode only (high freq 5,10,15,20kHz only are set at 10dB in equalizer) u feel pain & irritation in ur side head nerves.

So if we r talking abt vol abv 3/15 to below 12/15 this earphn are marvellous at cost 349.
Also don't buy white piece bcz they become dirty & looks very bad ugly & old so go for black colour.
don't think abt cable got damaged after some time bcz of its round design & not flat ; i think for 1 year there will be no damage unless if u not broke it forcefully.
And in last buy only when it is in offer at 349
So that ""paisa vasool""üëç",4

Sound quality is good bass is also good. Overall at this price it is good BUT be careful with the product if you accidentally pull the wire it may stop working. Call quality via earphone is best.,4
Its good.,4
Installing it was a bit complex as wireless could not detect ssid given in manual. So had to google and used dhcp. Signal is good. Price amazing got it for 849 and some cashback,4

"I am giving review after using it couple of times. Overall performance is good. Plastic body quality is just ok, could be better. If you are use-to with IT stuff then installation wont be any issue, but if you are not familiar then you should call for installation. Print quality is very good or I would say Awesome and fast too. Does the work for which you are buying it for. A small manufacturing issue I had is that power port is loose and goes inside when I plug in the power cable. But as an IT guy I am use to such issues to fix it so not a big deal for me. But yes if the plastic would better this wont happen I guess. One more thing! don't forget to register product on Epson website for warranty within 14 days of purchase. No one will tell you or remind you to do it. I think that performance wise this is best then other company printers, Also it is an oldest ink tank technology printer company. Don't worry go for it. (I will give another review after 7 month usage and also upload detailed video for installation DIY)",4
I have been using for a 3 month now it works perfectly as brand new. Others earphones I used before won't last for 2 month but this one did it. Go for it of you are looking for a budget earphone. Got it in a lightning deal,4

Quality is great moreover in this price range.. owesum.. i gifted this to my wife as she was much happier as the quality of sound is great and the ear buds are also too soft.,4
It is fab to use for the internal purpose and especially to those who are extremely fond of music. It comes with a melodious sound having powerful Bluetooth connectivity. Battery life is amazing.

"Performance:4/5, No issues till date, this is a pretty decent laptop to work with as ryzen 4000 series is simply smooth.

Battery:4/5, not the best in the category, but gets the work done, 6 hours in normal usage and 3-4 hours when I extensively used android studio.

Display:2/5 , dissappointed. Not a very good display, gets the work done but doesn't provide you that emersive experience. It's fine for people who are not into gaming and video editing, people like me who just use laptops for coding and development purposes.

Design: 4/5, flattered. This is a very sleek laptop and gives a premium look when you hold it. Though the body is made of plastic, but feels really sturdy and dependable.

Overall. I had idea about the display, I still went for it considering the performamce, design and size. This laptop is simply the best deal I could get at 45k during the big billion days sale. The display holds back a bit but it is managable at this price point considering all the good things embeded in it.",4
Easy to install n good coverage,4
I like the way it looks.,4
It's good but after 500 prints it's performance became slow,4
Absolutely loved it! It has almost been about 2-3 weeks since the product was delivered. Great battery life & the product is worth the money! Connecting the smart band to my MI phone takes no efforts.,4

Left side of speaker was get damaged, I cut the left side of earphone and managed to used only right side.. But after 1 week right side also get damaged. And earphone now is not for any work as it is now fully damaged..

Worked well for WFH.,4
Worth spending. Fullfill all smart watch needs. The battery life is excellent.,4

Good performance for its price range.
Value buy.

Bass is average. Sound quality is decent.
Might have to speak up in the calls. Mics are okay not great.",4
Quality is good but ink is expensive,4
"It does not sync your data regularly on the app.
It needs to be placed near to the device for the updates and syncing the data.
Heart rate monitor is not accurate.
Step tracking is accurate to the level of 80%, in case you are dancing by wearing the band it increases your steps more than the steps which you had actually taken.
Music control takes time to load
Mi app does not provide good watch faces for that you need to install third party app.",4
It's great.picture quality is awesome,4
Decent product.,4
God build quality. Great bass. The treble is also slightly higher. The optimization could have been better. A wired headphone for the high price are expected to deliver more.,4
Printer is so nice and good but the machine is working little bot slow.,4
The sponge on the ear gets torn easily in few months but good quality audio experience,4
Some size issu is little bit big,4
Initially i was little scared to buy modem through. But i trusted Amazon and just bought it really good. it only takes few seconds to start. but in performance and signal strength wise really good even if i am access ground floor.,4
"Writing this review after one week of usage.
Delivery by Amazon is good. Item delivered within three days in awesome condition.
Coming to the product itself...
The look is trendy and cool. Checked the precision of spo2 measurements with oxymeterand accurate readings everytime. Same for BP and heart rate.
The step counter is as accurate as a fitbit on comparison which is 8 times costlier.
Using it for last 7 days continuously all day and night even in the shower. No glitches till now and still have 45 percent battery remaining. So I guess at least ten days of back up on full charge which is pretty decent in this price range.
The Dafit app is also very nice. Only one issue with the app so far..it is not able to sync with Google Fit. So minus one star just for that.
Overall, an awesome smartwatch in this price range. Just go for it.",4

Good as budget phone with android 11.,4
Well... the product is good... installing took little time. The IP address configuration has to get matched with my service provider. My mobile phone caught the relay even at my parking space... below to my flat. But unfortunately the relay is weak in my bedroom.. may be due to the improper placement of the device. So far so good. Value for the money. Don't know ...more about after service and all... right now the device working properly... so who bother ..eh..??? I will of course recommend this... dudes..,4
Good in this budget segment.,4
good. can be purchased,4
"Nothing more nor less, Its been 2 months since I bought and monitor is working fine. It wobbles a lot when placed on the stand",4
"Dont expect a very high quality, but its worth of cost i buy for 550 rupees, you will feel the quality of sound and clear notes, delivery is 48hrs always good and packing is oky",4

"12 September, 2017 ; 15:21
Im happy with this speaker but also very disappointed with this. I was planning to buy sony d100 but due to money problem i can't afford right now.
My friends, this speaker is very good for normal rooms either used in 2bhk. You can feel the bass in another room also.
Im unhappy bcz this speaker doesn't have bass/treble option but you can feel strong bass. And sound is okay for small rooms.
Looks is also good. So purchased 2remote batteries before receiving this speaker. Let's create boom boom boom boom to disturb our neighbours üëäüëäüòÇ",4
Useful,4
"Best scanner.
Worst printing cost. Around ‚Çπ8 per page.
Easy to use.",4
"So far so good.
I will be back with full review",4
"I am writing this review after about 6 months of use as most earphones i purchased under Rs 1000/- never lasted for even half a year.

Surprisingly these are still working well (*touchwood*) despite my rugged use.

Pros:
- Great external noise cancelation.
- Good clarity while watching movies
- Reasonably decent bass levels of the price. They wont let you down when the beat drops :P
- Being an Audiophile whose working for brands like Yamaha, Jamo Dynaudio, mission amd many more these are the best for music to hear ever subtle note however I have to keep in my that I paid 599 for these on a lightning deal which makes the superb value for money while listening to music.
- Gold plated connector pin for higher conductivity.
- Clear microphone quality over call or while recording a vlog.
- lightweight due to which they are not a burden on your ears and don't fall of your ears easily.
- Cable spread adjustable lock built-in.

Cons:
- Gold plating on connector pin is slightly wearing of after 6 months.
- There are better bass heavy earphones at this or lower price point. But this is very subjective to the genre of music you listen too. As to much bass kills the Mids & Highs. So you can call these headphones as balanced.

Conclusion:
Go for these if you're looking for a pair of branded earphone under 999/- with a microphone which will last you for a reasonable long time & have good quality balanced sound for movies and music.

"Good Quality Sound.. I liked it very much..
Bass quality is awesome...
Crystal Clear sound...
But...

Surrounding was missing Little bit....",4
The earphone is quiet nice produces great sound and bass which is needed . Sound clarity is quiet good. The only problem is with its build quality which is not too good and the wire gets tangled.try to use a pouch for your earphone which makes it last longer.,4
Gifted to my husband on his B'day...he just liked it a lot..becoz of its features ....hppy with the buy... Fitness watch...ysss exactly it's....,4
Speaker phone would have better,4
"Good phonevery smooth screen, good battery life. One big disappointment is Snapshot option is not available.",4
Phenomenal product for value worth customers,4
A good product for the money spent. Leta hope it masta enough,4
"Sleep Tracking is Great, Mobile App is user friendly, Informative and is perfect for the band, Step Count Algorithm can be improved by the software updates.",4
This is the second product of Boat. My 1st earphones from Boat lasted over a year. This is also a good product in this price range.,4
"Very good product with improvised display n all.
But I think it would b better if it could come with the same price of the previous model and that would b reduced comparatively.",4
I am not satisfied with built in speaker and display type is LCD not led but though it's good product in this price segment .,4
THis is good router and my home is complitly wifi range speed also good and app are very good simple installation and working very fine Thanks amazon.....,4

"Phone is good and battery backup is very nice,working long time. But one thing i faced that i bought on first sale i found one problem that video recording audio not good very low hearing then i returned that one and get change with new. After getting new one i found that problem is same and that not problem its phone problem. Phone video recording audio is very low compare to others phone. I can't hear clear voice in even low distance recording.",4
"Even though at my home the generator kicks in after few min, the product stopped working exactly after 18months. The battery charging unit should be little more intelligent to avoid overcharging individual cells. There is no replacement option to change the batteries.",4
Well this product is good and easy to setup. If you want backup only for the WiFi router this is best alternatives to UPS though it cost almost the same as UPS. Somewhat over priced but does it job very well.,4
"Good product in this range, need few access in APP. Like only visible to verified devices",4
"This is a good value for money headphone.After considering many ones i choose this mainly for it's specification.The sound is warm, balance but not loud at all. Bass is good but not huge.You can easily wear it for long hours. As per per my rating 4/5. Lastly remember one thing we are getting what we paid for.",4
"High frequencies (treble) are boosted. Expected better sound quality from JBL .
But, good for price range.",4

"Got it three weeks back, works fine for me.
Range sufficent for 800sq ft flat.
Had issues while configuring initially using provided CD, later did few steps manually.",4
Sound quality and bass is super. While using long time have small pain ears.,4
"Got this product as a gift and on the first look itself, the headphones are overly sexy and ticks all the right features I was looking for. Giving my quick review for now (detailed after a week or so).

Pros:
1) Noise cancellation - The noise cancellation actually works good and I can't seem to hear much external stuff even when music is off (think like 80%).
2) Sound quality - On bluetooth connectivity, the sound is well balanced and bass is not much but doable. As an audiophile, I really appreciate the balanced nature of it. I have Spotify premium and my streaming quality is set to very high (so almost lossless).
3) Bluetooth connectivity - Haven't tested this part out but seems very normal. The audio quality from bluetooth connectivity is very normal.
4) AUX connectivity - With AUX, the sound quality increases a notch. I'm not much of a fan of the cable provided by it. However, will update further in the future when I buy a better cable.

Cons:
1) The volume via bluetooth seems very low. In my previous headsets, my average volume would be 70-80% but with this, I am listening to 90-100% to achieve the same levels.",4
At this range it's a good product. Only issue is it's a Chinese product and contains unusefull apps.,4
good product with quality and reasonable price,4
best for home use,4
"Great monitor in this price range, but its not truelly bazel less.",4

"This smart watch is one of the best instrument available in the market now. Monitoring of blood oxygen level and body temperature is accurate, however blood pressure accuracy is less. This may change with environment as well. Exercise modes are good as it helps to achieve one's health goals. Colour display is awesome. We can change the display in digital as well as analog modes. Music control also working well. Heart rate monitor also working well with the system. Overall worth for money.",4

Considering I have over 25-40 connections next to my house it covers it perfectly .... Won't give it 5 stars because the front grill doesn't match with the body else its an awesome product for household,4
"Lovely...Awesome.....But only fingerprint not working as per expectations...Very slow....
Overall is good...",4
"It's a moderate product.
Try it once before buying from someone who bought it
as the buds are too bulk, we feel pain in ears when one wear it for long time.
Have to listen songs with low volume,too heavy noice product.
Unnecessarily google assistant activates while adjusting buds in ears
If anyone is ready to compromise with above cons should definitely go for the Airbuds, otherwise it's a wonderful product.",4

These are such a steal for its price point they perform amazingly well for such a low budget.

"The watch is fine for the price; but, to get the accessories of this brand is a real task. Have faced the same problem for the noise color fit pro and pro 2. The charger of the previous watch had stopped working after a year; so I needed a new charger but it wasn't available anywhere however hard I tried; and the watch without a charger is useless. The same goes with the noise color-fit pro 2 after I purchased it after the previous watch. The charger is so small that it got misplaced in the house work. I cannot buy another ""original charger"" since noise doesn't keep their accessories easily available. So in this case, I got to use my watch only for 6 months since I do not want to risk my watch battery by using a duplicate charger available. Noise needs to keep their accessories as well, easily available on their website. It only shows sold out every time you visit their website and is never available once the product is more than a year old. What is the point of buying from this brand in that case? NOISE PLEASE FIX THIS! At least request you to keep your chargers and important accessories available!!",4

- Borderless compact design
- value for money

Dis-likes:

- no built in speakers",4
I-am using this product for tracking physical activities,4
"No fingerprint reader
Low camera quality
Plastic built.
Thick
And notch is irritating",4
Nice Sound and bass as compared to price n all,4
Product is good.Little tough to start with. But satisfied with results,4
Yay activity tracker just does the job some software support could be handy chinese products don't rely on firmware updating since there is no developer to address the issue electrical impulses in body are tingy while wearing mi band 4,4
I bought these speakers for my living room. I connected them to my sony LED 40 inch TV. The speakers are good enough to be used as TV speakers (not great). The bass is good and very powerful. Sound clarity is decent. Overall satisfied with the product.,4
More LED lights should be there,4
Overall a good phone,4
Works as advertised. Good Product fro the price.,4

"Nice watch works fine during workouts.Gives accurate readings of walking,sitting,and workouts.",4
Fingerprint sensor is superfast. Battery also fine for long time users. Camera quality also wonderful. Especially that true 48MP feature is amazing.,4
"Im writing this review after 1 month , the product is pretty good with high quality sound nd bass system , the earphones will easily get tucked in the ear . But only one thing is that the wire provided is tooooo long .",4

But the cabinet was light weight so the bass was not loud",4

Superrrr,4
Good budget phone.. You get the value for the money.. Battery life is good and phone performance is good.. If you are going to store more data get 64gb.. Camera quality is ok for the price.. Don't expect much clarity or great photos.. You get decent photos for a low range budget smartphone..,4

I did not like that we have to open printer to remove pages that are jam.,4
Nice product. Value for money,4
Product is gud n easy to use. But wifi range is limited,4
Very good performance,4
"I did so many research on the display size, display quality, display resolution and etc.. as a software developer we design and develop applications where we need color accuracy and text clarity for coding and stuffs, which is not great but feel strange blurry feeling while reading/writing the code(might be i am used to much higher quality display of laptops), most suitable for professional office work like excel and writing documents watching videos and surfing is exceptional as mentioned for this price range. and adjustable and rotatable display makes things much easier for users.",4
This is good but comfort is not addictable awesome in low price,4
I bought it one month back. Till now it is working fine. Have to observe it more. Signal strength is not good in next room. It can be improved,4

But amazing smart wearable experience in a pocket-friendly price.",4
"Sleep Tracking, The Mobile app and touch screen is all good.",4
Signal strength is good using from almost 2 year,4
"Bought in May 2020.
So far the print quality has looked average.
I realised it doesnt have paper storage - its a good feature to have.
Its supports double sided print but manually. So you have to put the paper again to make it peint on the other side. Another good feature to have.
Installation was ok with the help of youtube videos.
Wifi setup was a pain but i got through it.
Nevertheless, i hope it stays good for a few years.",4
"Fantastic sound and bass quality, really I like it.",4
Avg.product,4
"Fingerprint sensor is not available, face unlock feature is available, value for money phone for this price range , I exchanged with my old HTC device ,it costs me around 6299 Rs for 2GB variant , built quality is good, feels solid in hand , sky white colour looks pretty decent and beautiful in hand, cannot expect a good gaming performance from this device, tried playing Pubg lite & Free fire, not suitable for gamming. Best part is battery back up & USB Type C charging port with fast charging options available. Not satisfied with the face unlock feature. Can be considered as a good option for secondary handset, overall a value for money product.",4
"Sound quality is best. Ears dont pain even if you wear it for long hours.super bass.
1 thing that I did not like is Mike. Need to keep in front of mouth and speak. Less noise cancellation.",4
It can't run music control and workout calculation in parallel. Which is moat important when a person is using it in gym. Otherwise good fitness band.,4
"Nice device for beginners, Well packaged",4
Dual WiFi is good. Smart TV can be operated with 5ghz signal & 2.4 GHz for mobiles without lag. Covers my 2 bhk very well.,4
Router stopped working after a month. Very disappointed as there is no support from tp link. They expect you to shop the router to their office at vasai and you'll have to bear the shipping costs for their mistake???!!!. Suggest u buy this from a local vendor as you'll at least have after sales support.,4
"Nice and convenient printer, user friendly and economical",4
Accuracy has some problems rest all is good,4
"pros

- power saving mode
- easy to eyes
- easily does all work surfing, movie, office wok(not tried game as i don't play)
- best mate during WFH

- should hv side ports....at least 1 HDMI",4
Watch quality is excellent but the charging cable and the strap quality is bad,4
"well, i purchased this router after considering many routers , for this price range and for Wifi a/c , it turned out to be a great product !",4

"Headphones üéß are absolutely perfect. It pairs so easily. The only Drawback I faced is that, Earcups were short for me.... So created some pain in that area.... Which is not a big problem after some days of usage.

Sound Quality and Passive Noice Cancellation are perfect. Would surely recommend for Online classes and workshops and Meetings and Listening Music.",4
"I asked to gift wrap this item na..
But delivered without giftwrap.",4
"Like the product alot, for an average day to day user, it serves its purpose and isnt much of a hassle when it comes to untangling the wires and overall sound quality was really good, if you want better then make sure the quality of the music is atleast 320kbps",4
Product is good but can't connect with TV.,4
Everything is good.prefer Bluetooth headset in boat can be use if charge is completed with the connecter,4

"In this price rang, this is a good phone. Snapdragon 439 processor is good enough for calling, Video, youtube and other processes.
Dual rear camera is very good.
Battery is also a plus point for this mobile.
Overall its value for money.",4
"The bass is nice and well balanced. The headphones are a steal at ‚Çπ499 for me. They work we but can pinch a user on the ears after 2 hours of continuous usage. The fitting could have beeh better.
Pros :
1. Great build quality on the 3.5mm jack and overall sound quality on the headphones is pretty good for the price!
2. Great treble and rock music playback is awesome.
3. A steal at the price, VFM 10/10

Cons:
1. A metallic built headphone unit would have been better. The plastic makes it basic.
2. Not very comfortable to wear.
3. Bass isn't the best. 7/10
Sound quality: 7.5/10
VFM: 9/10",4

excellent printer,4
"Pros:
1) Print quality is good
2)Scanning is easy and Xerox is also good
3) User friendly functions
4) Good for Home use, when you only have to print in less quantity

Cons:
1) Constantly facing problems with wifi, direct wifi and its all so complicated. Installed an app in mobile the 1st day, everything was fine. Next day it keeps showing ""Driver unavailable""
2) It took 3 days to install in Computer.
3) User manual is not useful. it hardly says anything there

Getting it installed in ur mob and computer right is the key..else its a headache",4

But not aware that N300+ model is available.",4

Great purchase for the price tag,4
Fingerprint reader and battery life is good. But camera quality is not good.,4
"This is a great product.
I have been using this for over 2 weeks now and really never had to bother about my wifi speed during this time.
I have an ACT fibernet connection, which delivers 150 mbps broadband.
With this dual band router i always get full speed on 5GHz and approximately 50mbps if connected to 2GHz frequency.
It can pretty easily cover 2,3 Bhk homes if placed centrally. Even works considerably for a floor above and below. But signal strength washes away if you ho beyond. THAT IS FINE.

Usage:
We usually connect 2 Mobiles, 2 laptops, 1 FullHd tv streaming Netflix etc and 1 echo dot with fluid ,stable connection.
There is no buffering in Tv while playing any online content.
My major concern with old router was while working over VPN as that demands really stable connection (Less speed is fine but it shouldn't flicker), now i don't notice a difference if i m connected to ethernet or on wifi.

It would be cherry on top if one USB port was provided, thats ok i guess since i had no specific use case for it. Unless you want to create a local NAS kind of stuff.

And thanks amazon for great delivery and price.!!!!",4
phone ok hai bus thoda ui me bug hai or camera avrege nhi or thoda achha ho sakta tha üëç,4
"To be true it is one of the Best Monitor one can get, brightness level is good and the colors look punchy. The only complaint is that the bezels can be more slimmer as I was expecting a better overall design. Go for it brindly, best under 10K",4

"In one word it's just awesome and best camera. Before buying I search and gather information about cctv camera .And then i contacted some local cctv provider for my store..All are local cctv provider was told me a huge price for cctv approx 18k to 22k so when i told then about IP camera they said it comes high price but good. In my locality every shop have cctv camera I checked them but believe me all are waste of money no clear picture even day time face is not clear .And maily issue for me is wiring .DVR camera comes with many wire and big hardisk which is very bad for me.So i bought this camara with 128gb memory card now you check my night picture what a clear picture . Beside medicine shop owner check and said what is this how can be too clear they have DVR camara which is not clear and also not watching from home..It's cheap and best i can control from my home with internet.
Pros :
1. Clear night vision ( Check my photo)
2.cute look..
3.Control from home
4.SD card recording i can watch from phone no need to insert laptop or like that
Cons :
1 Only sound is very eco so road side shop is problem
2 .I used storage 128gb but 24/7 recording block 8 gb per day so calculate it",5

"A great external monitor that's just the right size for day to day office work and occasional Netflix/ Prime viewing. Was looking for a monitor to help manage working from home and the increased need for an additional monitor to help with screen share / presentation etc.

Need a little tweak to make this really great.

When this was plugged in at 1st, the text were awful and no matter what I tried to do with the settings nothing seemd to work. Finally after playing with the settings options on the monitor (not via Windows OS) figured out that setting the 'Game Mode Always On' did the trick. The text is razor sharp and smooth transition when you drag and drop windows and other apps. Most of the other settings were kept at factory setting. Monitor is very very bright at 100%. Recommended to dial it down to 20-25%. Hope this helps if you are struggling with the resolution.",5
"I Like it ""mi band 5""",5
Very good performance. Takes little long to connect.,5
"This is my first smart watch.
I am quite amazed by its features.

Smooth and Reliable.Good printer.want customer support to install the driver,5
Perfect watch,5
Go For It,5
"Good product, good base, good sound. Worth buying",5
"Reviewing after using for around 2 months.
The Product is easy to install and use.  Configuration is easy. Stays connected on WiFI reliably. Software has enough features for a regular user.

Installation HW is included for standard wall/roof mount. If one needs a special installation away from the wall, one can also install on a bracket (which you have to arrange).

The angle adjustment. pan/tilt works in a very reliable way. One can also set some default markers (preset positions) to where camera angle can be moved with click of a button (e.g. road side view, door view, balcony view, parking view - you can set and give name of your choice).

Motion detection - One can also define zones within which one wants motion to be detected.
One can also define a schedule for motion detection and recording (which hours one wants continous  recording and which hours only when motion is detected.

Through the Tapo App, one can get alerts and also access recordings from anywhere in the world. Recordings are on the SD card which is on the camera. I wish they add an easy to use utility to support network storage. There are methods available but too technical for a common non computer literate or a geek user.

Sound - quality of microphone and speaker an average (usually camera is installed at a height and away from person talking or listening so there is not much to expect from this aspect.

Overall with a price around Rs 2500 for the camera and few hundred rupees for the memory. It is a value for money product. In the app, on one network one can add up to 32 Tapo Cameras if one wants a more elaborate setup. ",5

"I still has a working TP-Link router but that sucks in the range. I was getting the range even in 2 BHK flat. I choose Tenda because of excellent reviews on its range and it has really wide and strong range. Setup is really easy.
Tip : To get perfect range you need to adjust the antenna position optimally. Use any network speed app and try with different antenna position and you will able to get perfect range. You can also read some articles about setting up router antenna in optimal position.",5

Only negative point is, there are not many choices for watchface right now.",5
A very good router. A good range for my 960sqft apartment. Gives very good speed over 5ghz band and 2.4ghz both. I am using a 100mbps connection and get almost the same speed in actuality. I am using 4-5 devices simultaneously. Worth buying.,5

"I had this Smartphone for my mother. Now after using it about 15 days , I can assure you that Xiaomi has arranged a great deal , but by the time passes new Smartphones will be it's competitors. So remember it's time and current scenario I can completely recommend you to buy this phone if your budget is below 10k .
I had ordered 3gb+32gb sea blue variant and got delivered within 5 days , thanks to Amazon. The phone supports 18 watt fast charging and has 5000 mah battery and face unlock , which are unexpected in this price range. But Snapdragon 439 processor is not eligible to do any hard work . I would recommend to use this phone for basics.",5
"I do like the Gadget.. overall performance is satisfactory.

Only worry is that, if any mode is not selected during exercise
Calories are not being counted accordingly",5

nice smart watch gives every data required for fitness. every one should have this watch. compared to fit bit you can get all the features with less price.,5
"Awesome music system....
Cons
1. no easy provision for placing speakers around the room (length of wires very short)....

Pros.
Other than what I have mentioned above everything is perfect.
1 great sound quality with superb bass.
2 good remote and Bluetooth sensitivity
3 it has 4 10w speakers which gives louder sound than many 5.1 systems.
4 I got it for 2.6 K @ this price I feel wonderful

Very nice printer quality is best,5
"First of all, kudos to Amazon for on-time delivery of product. Placed the order on Saturday and received it the very next day despite it being a regular delivery order. I was a bit hesitant at first while placing the order given the ordeal a few of the buyers had faced here. The seller was Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. But, thankfully, everything was in place when I received the package; all the seals were in place. All the bottles were packed. I got the GST invoice too. So, overall a nice purchase experience.
Coming to the product, I was in 2 minds whether to go for G3000 or G3012. But since GST credit wasn't available, I had to go for this one. I wonder why they can't give a GST invoice on the other one. Setting up the printer was a breeze. Just make sure that you go through the installation manuals first. A little more of text and not just images in the manuals would have been much more helpful. There's a short animated video regarding the installation procedure by Canon on Youtube as well. That was really helpful. After going through the manual and the video, the setup took barely 15 minutes. I see a few reviews telling that the printer consumed a little ink even before taking a single printout. Well, that's so because at the time of setup, the printer sucks a bit of ink to fill the pipes going to the print head. The per print ink consumption is going to be really low post the installation.
I tried my hand at interfacing the printer through direct wi-fi to my Android smartphone first. It got connected without any fuss. Haven't tried connecting it through router yet. After having both the devices paired, I got a nice colored document printed first. It took around 8-10 seconds and print quality was great. Next I printed a document in grey-scale. The output was great and it took under 5 seconds to have the document printed. Next, I scanned a document to my smartphone and it disappoint me this time either. Will post an update once I try it with glossy photo paper.
So all in all, it was a great buying experience and I am completely happy with the purchase.",5
The WiFi single strength is good for a 1BHK house uses. If using for 2BHK then you might have to install booster.,5
Nosise,5
"I dont want to talk about the specs and other technical stuff - since you can compare that and see for yourself.
Overall - its a great laptop with 16 gb ram and at this price point - its perfect for home business and personal use.

Probably cant use it for A grade gaming or heavy image editing or very heavy data processing / data science

Whats great:
1. Trackpad
2. Keyboard
3. Fast boot
4. Great look and feel
5. small and light

Whats not so great:
1. The screen cant swivel/fold beyond a few degrees
2. the cover is a dust magnet
3. the keyboard couldve been slightly better",5
Awesome üòç High Quality Material ‚ù§Ô∏è,5

I returned HP GT 5820 as this one was 10 cm smaller in width. I could set the printer up in 20 mins. Additional advantage is that it comes with two extra black ink bottles in the box.,5

"Value for money, screen could be better with more watch faces",5
"I've been waiting for this smartwatch for so long and I would say that it's not at all disappointing.
Firstly the display is really good, touch was really smooth even in broad daylight I could see the display clearly.
Secondly I've being using it on for 13 days now and the battery percentage is at 29%.
There are some minor bugs like the wrist awake feature it's a little bit late some bugs while you connect your bluetooth audio device but I think it can be solved through software updates.
Overall for the price point it's totally worth it and it's really good.",5

 Price Paid: Rs. 7000
Seller: https://amzn.to/2Is7kBc

Pros
- FULL HD IPS LED Monitor with anti-glare finish.
- Good picture quality with accurate colors. Has very high brightness, range from 0 to 100. Presently I have set both brightness and contrast at level 0, and its still bright.
- The 22-inch size doesn't feel very big, feels slightly bigger than 18.5 inch monitor.
- Very sleek and stylish looking with minimal bezels.
- Wall mounting option is provided.
- The monitor weighs just 4 Kgs.
- The monitor is powered by 19V adapter, not direct AC supply, which is better.
- It has many ports, 1 HDMI port, 1 DVI port, and 1 VGA port. For audio out, it has headphone jack. You can also connect a 2nd HDMI cable to the DVI port using an HDMI to DVI adapter.
- The monitor has only 1 switch (joystick), which is under the LG logo.
- Power consumption around 15 Watts.

Cons:
- Increases the CPU running temperature considerably unless you have the latest PC. I had a 720p monitor earlier and CPU temperature was much lower.
- Glossy finish, though not a bad thing, it can easily get scratches and fingerprints.
- Stand is not very stable, can topple forward easily.

Make sure you buy from an amazon approved seller: https://amzn.to/2Is7kBc",5

I was struggling with multiple parallel video calls and the quality dropping frequently as I was on TP-Link AC1200. Read about mu-mimo technology and bought this router. One of the things not mentioned in the feature is super fast boot time after power reset which is a boon for me.,5
Loved it!!!,5

"I have researched for more than 3 months while buying Philips MMS8085B. I purchased this in 6200 bucks and believe this is one of the best speakers in this range. I also checked the Boat soundbars which are in this range, but Philips has a edge over all those soundbars and speakers. At first it comes with classy look that attracts anybody attention towards it. Second the Sound quality is awesome. I have connected it with my TV using bluetooth and it performs awesome. Base quality is also very good. You can change the base as per your requirement. However the remote buildup quality is very poor.",5

Good product. ‚ò∫,5
"I was uncertain when I bought this band because of the reviews written by people but this watch is actually great if you have doubts let me assure you that it is one of the best fitness bands on Amazon. I will list some pros and cons
PROS :-
1) amazing battery life it has been 5 days from when I last charged it is 79%
2) easy charging
3) good display
4) looks nice
5) step counting is not perfect (90% accurate )
6) all the workout modes are great .
7) the app is great and easy to use settings are quiet simple (MI Fit app)
8) the music controlling feature comes handy while working out and walking instead of reaching out to your phone tochnage the song you can just use the watch as someone who likes to listent to music I like that feature
CONS:-
1) For me one of the biggest cons is that it only counts steps when your hand is moving , for instance when the watch first arrived I thought it was defected because it was not counting steps but as soon as I started moving my hands steps increases . I haven't had problems with the step counting since then .
2) on the first day I wore the watch the strap got sweaty easily causing itching and redness but after you adjust to the watch it does not happen .
3) the display is smaller than it looks .

There are some features that I haven't used sleep tracking (I don't wear the watch when I sleep ) and PAI ( I personally don't understand what it does ) DND (don't know what that is )",5
Good Laptop....Speed is Good happy with Lenovo,5
Best quality product sold by seller,5
Fantastic purchase,5
"Excellent printing,best for home purpose school worksheet, documents printing",5
Very useful at this price,5
"Good, fast delivery.

Good monitor for office work and 1080p gaming. Amd free sync ability helps go 75Hz without vsync. Colors could be better, though. And the dynamic contrast ratio is more pain than pleasure.

Bezels are not as narrow as it seems. The rim is definitely narrow and the glass big, but when on you will notice gaps around the screen on the edges, under glass.

No bundled driver. Default drivers work fine but if you want a bit more functionality use the online driver/controller app.",5
Its been using 4 month nd its awesome in this range,5

"It works flawlessly with my PS4 pro with resolution set to max and HDR turned on without any hiccups.

It also have different kinds of display presets for gaming like FPS 1, FPS 2 and few other modes. You can customize as per your liking in the custom mode. It has audio jack just above DC adapter connection behind the panel. Through which you can connect your headphones/speakers without even needing the audio jack in the PC. Display is IPS, Res- 4K and supports HDR10, display latency- 5ms. So if you have a gaming PC or consoles like XBOX One X or PS4 PRO then this monitor would be your choice in this price segment.",5

"This is actually better than it's D-Link Alternative for the same price. So if you are confused which one to buy as they both are Dual band and have almost same features, go for the Tp-Link one.

Though the casing is made of plastic, but it doesn't look cheap or of low quality. It's light and comes with a small CAT 5 Ethernet cable which is okay if you forgot to purchase your cable and want to test it out as soon as it reaches your doorstep",5
"This camera is really handy and good for beginners. The packing also had carry bag which
was unexpected. The packing should have been better as the main box was not fitted to hold the D3500 box firmly and I think it came wobbling from packing to delivery. Luckily the D3500 box had all Camera items in slots with good fit. Good to buy one more battery if you travel or click regular pics.",5
Every think is ok. Camera is very bad,5
"Really good, economical and fast. Nothing to complaint about.",5
It has so good volume control and sound quality.it has good noise cancellation also.,5

"I have a broad band connection with WiFi router. Whenever there was a power outage, even though we had a generator backup in the building it would take few seconds to start. During this period, once the power was down the router would go off and would take couple of minutes to start once the generator was switched on. Same would happen when power would resume and line would switch back to main from generator backup. So Everytime the power was down and power would resume, the router would go off one take couple of minutes to start. This was very disturbing and frustrating while working on something important.
Then, I got to know about this product 'Resonate Router UPS' while browsing through Amazon products and ordered it immediately. Since then there is no looking back. Resonate was very to install with the help of the instruction manual provided with the product. It hardly took couple of minutes to install and since then the router has never been switched off.
Resonate Router UPS' is very reasonable and a handy product to have.",5

"The bass is not as good as the BassHead 225 but produces pretty good quality sound. The earpieces weigh way too light, it could be a good thing because it doesn't put a lot of weight on your ears, but also could be a bad thing when its windy and it flies off your ears",5
The wifi speeds are fine whenever I use it and connects in an instant. The modem is kept in a closed room and I normally use the wifi one floor below it. I guess the twin antennas really help.,5
"I liked Redmi Smartphones just because of their long-lasting battery. Besides this, Redmi takes care of their products' quality.

A big thumbs up!",5

No issues in wearing while taking bath. TESTED :)",5
"posting this review after 2 weeks of daily usage
this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels), battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned up to 12hrs on box.
it takes 2-2:10hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent, very clear and loud, bass levels are great. tried it with many different devices like laptop,pc, smart tv and mobile, sounds great on every devices specially it sounds more better on mid end and high end devices.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice but still not that worse experience
build quality is great, has soft touch plastic finish on outer side. perfectly fits on every as size is fully adjustable.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy your music without any interruption.
overall this headphone is best buy for money. if anyone need a great big size headphone at this price then i will definitely recommend this",5

I Am Order It 26th FEB They Delivery it 28th Feb And Best Quality Product From Amazon ...And My Router is Good Speed And Coverage 5 GHz and 2 GHz ..Thank u.,5
"i really like this watch. Helps me track my calories burn and sleep . It also track different activities like yoga ,workout, cycling and many more . There is one thing this watch doesn't have and i wanted it . Thats distance tracking on bike. So it track your steps and give you approximate distance you walked but it does not track your distance when you are cycling . As they have cycling in the activity list i think they should have added distance tracking while cycling too. Otherwise watch is really good , touch is working super good . Convenient while you riding a bike .you can see your msgs n calls on the watch , i love puttibg alarm on it . Also one thing i love is you can customize the wallpaper, you can put your personal pics if you want.",5
"It's been over 4 months of use, and I am still in love with this monitor as I was on Day 1 when I saw it on delivery. It's very lightweight, runs cool even after runing straight for 32 hours, blacks look good on the screen for the price. Love the way it automatically controls the brightness based on the surrounding, and it really isn't that harsh on eyes. So overall, 5+ for me. Fully satisfied.",5

"Excellent Product, i just love it. Its too good during covid-19 oxy meter cum watch",5
Seems to be pretty good product.,5
"provides a strong 5ghz signal, has anti virus and alexa control. best feature is prioritizing devices for better bandwidth.

being intel powered the chip is very stable

has a usb port to add disk drive and a vpn connection via cloud so you access your own files outside.

the wifi maxes out my isp speed, in fact my link 150 mbps but the pic shows im getting 250 mbps owing to my phone supporting the layest wifi standards!!!

it can autoswitch from 5 to 2.4ghz if you set it up on the admin, useful when the signal gets low on 5ghz and you go far from the router.

it has every feature you can think of, you need to look at the admin panel.

if you have home automation devices this is really good. I dont think need to buy another router for the next 4 years.",5
"It's been 2 years I am using this router. Easy to setup, has good wifi signal strength across the house.",5
"Good product,
Value for money",5
"Got this product in amazon sale @549. Headphone at this price from JBL is good. Sould qulaity and brass is perfect in this price range. Its handy and light. You will get 3 ear buds in the packet and can be changed as fitting to users ears. Well ear buds could have been more soft if you compare it with sennheiser headphone of this price range but that would be without mic facility.

So overall at this price with a good brand I got a good head phone with mic and better sound experience.",5
Werry good product,5
great product in this price,5
"At this price, this monitor is good value for money. It is perfect for most home and office uses. With the thin bezel it feels really big. It would have been better if the height of the stand was adjustable. But the very large viewing angle compensates for this.",5
Brilliant product. The SPO2 on this is so accurate. Lasts long in terms of battery life & is slick to just look at.,5
One of the best products in the category,5

 Woowww its a amazing product and i got it only 599 i think everyone should go throw it without any enquiries I m very happy thank you Amazon sound quality noise cancellation ND bass quality also very good",5
"Nice phone, as expected. Only negative side is that it belongs to a Chinese company and a part of our payment will reach the Chinese (though made in India).

Only Sub 10K price range phone with snapdragon processor and 64GB phone memory.

Phone don't have fingerprint unlock, but have face unlock.

Battery lasts for 2 days for average normal use (calls, social media and youtube, without gaming)

Camera also good, with decent portrait mode with background blur and all the gimmicks.

All in all a good budeget phone.

Still i am a little upset that i supported the Chinese (even though indirectly)",5
"Original product with good packing from amazon and on time delivery.
Using this router since 1 year, it has very wide wavelength of WIFI signal and had no issues till date.",5
Its veryyy effected.Best products,5

"Sound is gud, bass also excellent only prob is outer ear gets pain after 2hrs continuous usage",5
"On 26.05.2020 I installed and following points I observed
1. Installation: it is ver easy simple plug and play method

2.it shows two bandwidth 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz
In any device means tv , laptop , mobile etc,,,

3.speed test on 2.4Ghz :

Distance test 1: on 2.4Ghz 1cm (only 1cm distance not 1 feet even)from router location maximum speed 40mbps out of 100mbps

Distance test 2: on 2.4Ghz 30feet from router location maximum speed 30mbps out of 100mbps

Now points to be observed :

On 2.4Ghz the maximum speed upto 30feet distance we get only from 40mbps to 30mbps out of 100mbps internet connection speed , beyond that much distance it is highly impossible to get even this much speed on 2.4Ghz. so now doubts are cleared.

Speed test on 5Ghz :

Distance test 1:
1cm (only 1cm distance not 1 feet even)from router location maximum speed 93mbps out of 100mbps
Distance test 2:
30feet from router location maximum speed 93mbps out of 100mbps

Now points to be observed :

On 5Ghz the maximum speed within 30feet range means from 1cm to 30 feet distance range we can get 93mbps Speed out of 100mbps without interuption, but beyond that 30 feet I observed the Speed is vigorously slowed down to 20mbps

that menas on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz the maximum distance is only 30 feet beyond that distance 2.4 GHz is dead slow and 5Ghz is 20 to 25 based on fluctuations .

Then you have a doubt here then why two bandwidth means some devices support only 2.4 GHz Speed that is the reason but we compromise the Speed on 2.4 GHz

so first you check your device support 5 GHz band width or not .
Now all douts are cleared",5
"My experience with Fire-Boltt Beast has been an amazing one. As the name suggests, it's really a beast with 1.69"" HD display. The performance of this watch is great. The best part about this watch is how accurately it measures my Blood Oxygen levels (Spo2), Blood Pressure and BPM (beats per minute). The construction is super lightweight and feels very premium. The HD display is bright and has been keeping up pretty well even under direct sunlight. It has a powerful battery back up of 15 days and I have used it for workouts, and the water resistance is really impressive. The included strap is also very comfortable and I have had no irritations while wearing it.",5
Really good. Affordable. With swivel and good on the eyes,5
Its a two in one DSL modem with dongle backup. Works great. I would prefer this product then any other router in the market.,5

"Try testing this product with some Epic them music, You will know its worth.
I have tested and it really works fine.
Though it does not have one bass Knob, I never felt I needed that. This is mainly because whatever bass is locked in audio it presents it perfectly.
So we can hear sounds what Music producers wanted us to hear,! without us manipulating the bass.

Thank you",5
No compromise in internet speed. Overall wifi range is short. Suitable for 1000-1200 sqft spaces.,5

"Easy to install. Compact. Have worked to an extent of one hour power cut, didn't tried for stress and exhaustive usage. Good for normal usage.",5
"I bought them 6 months ago & they started creating problem after few days. I managed it as the return window was closed. But few days ago the speakers suddenly went off. I tried different techniques to power them on but they didn't.
Finally, I called Philips customer care & spoke to one of the idiots who wasn't interested in dealing with it. Somehow he booked an appointment & said you will receive a call in 6 working hours. I waited for that call for 2 days......
Then I called Amazon & spoke to an advisor who politely advised me to call Philips customer care again & said that if they won't help then Amazon is there to help you.
I called them again and this time somebody really called me and visited my place to see what's wrong. He took 7 days to solve the problem as he was ill (which was fine).
He changed the motherboard & now I have the speakers working in a proper way & they are giving much better sound than before. Thank you Amazon.",5

Awesome all rounder..
Perfect for gaming..
Display panel is bright enough and the thin bezels over the corners looks classy with the LG branding..
It has 1 HDMI port..
But I use PC & DTH on this by removing and connecting the HDMI Cable..
Even DTH works flawlessly..
Picture Quality is 5x times better than 32 inch MI TV as this is 24 inch with 1080p resolution I love watching HD contents with DTH in this Monitor..

"This product was my first order with Amazon and I am absolutely satisfied with Amazon's services and the product. I was apprehensive of buying online considering the lack of Customer Service observed earlier in India, before Amazon arrived. But with Amazon's excellent service and return policies, this has changed.
The product is working fine since I bought it, 10 months back. I keep it switched on throughout the day and it works perfectly without any issues (it does get a little warm at the bottom of the router). With a 5db antenna, the Wi-Fi signal range is also good and I am able to access it from the inner most room of my 1300 sq ft house. At this price this is the best in the lot.",5

"I ordered Tenda AC8, few days before ordering this; on YouTube, tenda had better reviews and better looks. Upon delivery within 1.5 hrs of plug-in and it began to heat up; on few more hours of high data usage it was so hot that it definitely felt the product was defective. I ordered a replacement, exact same thing happened. I called for refund and got this Archer C6, for more 200 bucks.

I am using it for 1 week now, very less heating, which is considered ok. I found the range to be almost same. It also has more led lights which shows various indicators unlike Tenda which has 1 led and we have to see the the blinking gap to understand what it's saying.

Summary: Best router, reliable brand. Don't seek anywhere for review or suggestions. One regret i couldn't buy it at the time of a sale and didn't get any bonus discount.",5
Thanks for good offer,5

I have printed 100 pages a day as well and there were no issues.
Note- keep taking out a single colour print in every 15-20 days and you will never have problem with the printer head which is common issues with printers,",5

"I have bought this model C1200, So what I like or not like about it,

Pros of this router
1) Same speed as my connection (50mbps).

2) Easy to setup, for mobile setup it's the easiest because everything is there in that app and need only your username or password(PPPoe) or a Static IP given by your ISP.
Who knows the advance stuff this router provide(Only experts can do the advance stuff).

3) There are options like:
a) Parental controls(sad for kids though),
b) QoS for bandwidth control(for limiting the data it goes to every device),
c) You can setup Guest connection (if you want that privacy and annoying your guest),
d) Blocked those annoyed person's internet(if you want),
e) Other stuff that experts only can use.

4) There is a USB port for connecting a pen drive or a hard drive if you want a network storage,
Or you can plug your printer to make it wireless(Best features for old printers or non Wireless printer).
Everything is automatically made by the interface, but you can tweak a little bit.

Cons of this router
1) Well it has both 2.4G and 5G at the same time, but it is limited to 10 devices at 2BHK,5 devices at 1BHK. You really REALLY need a mesh or other router of the same company to connect more devices.

2) Well if you go to the advance stuff, normal people will toggle the wrong settings, Really most of the things in advance mode is seriously configure, only use basic mode for less craziness.

3) It's USB 2.0, so don't expect those serious transfer rate like USB 3.0 or Type-C provides. But it's is nice to have this feature.

4) There is a TP-Link Cloud but it applies to home or office security and you have to pay for the cloud storage(If you have or someone has experience).
Well lets buy a 2TB or 1TB hard drive and job done.",5
Signal range is less but overall good.,5
"Just go for this watch blindly..

The only thing is that cushion is coming out and seems the quality of cushion could be much better but still I'm very happy . it's just osm . I'M REGRETTING WHY I GAVE SHOT TO OTHER BRANDS LIKE SONY ,JBL. IT'S FAR BETTER THAN OTHER PRODUCTS . GO AHEAD IT'S SUPERB.",5

Sound quality is good. üëåüëå",5
"I am writing this review because there are so many misleading review about the poor performance. I have a variety of speakers in past 2.1, acoustic, monochannel ,stero channel party boxes and all. So its pretty much i have observed all the segments of sound quality from intex to bose. This speaker is not a bose level but its far better than fenda, creative and other regular over the counter brands in market .. this speaker reminds me of my old altec Lansing 2.1 which now is discontinued. Now coming straight to bullet points.
Pros:
‚ñ™Ô∏é25 watts of bass is best in comparison to 6.5 inch woofer category it doesn't distort if you are using 320kbps tracks on a good quality device.
‚ñ™Ô∏é12.5 watts √ó2 midrange aks satellite speakers are clear as crystal.
If you listen to EDMS, HIPHOP and JaZz this is the best speaker in this price range .
Cons:
‚ñ™Ô∏éRemote is very basic no feature to adjust bass or treble from it.
‚ñ™Ô∏éonly blue led light is present which is in sync with the audio frequency of song.

This speaker is not at all bad it leave an impression of a niche brand at your crib. Also it have a very good bass to treble ratio only people who have had an experience with highend devices will appriricate that. Its not having the overpass bass that you listen in local weddings .. its having the sound which is perfect for enjoying music and movie mode is balance too for giving you a deep sound with clear dialogs.",5

Best quality and good printing quality,5
Excellent night vision. Easy to install. Just have to buy memory cards beforehand. Has this feature of marking spots for quick rotation - liked it.,5
"Did not expect such quality. Amazing. Very Recommended.

In Some reviews, People were saying Display was necessary to see if volume high or low etc. For me i this it is not required just because, whenever you pres any key on remote, the LED light on the woofer blinks if it is changing. In other words, if you keep on pressing volume button low, it will blink till the volume drops to the lowest level and after that it stops blinking. Same goes with Bass as well.

Quality is superb and voice is clean.",5
"Best fitness band at low price

It is also comfortable but you will feel some pain in ear when you use it for long terms if you have large ears. For more clearance watch my video in the review. You will get an idea of sound quality.",5
Amazing monitor. Good value for money. Mine came with a D Sub cable. Packaging was also top notch!!,5

"Awesome band.. brightness is too good.. by default the band brightness settings is to 3rd point you can set it to 5 to see the max brightness. Every function in the band is working very good. The only con i find in mi band is in the sleep tracker, if mi could provide in detailed info regarding sleep like REM and calories burnt during sleep which other band provides, expect that everything is worthwhile in the band",5
Really good product at this price. Worth buying. Accurate results.,5
"My purpose was to increase the coverage of the existing wireless network. Tried an extender Tp-link RE450 which was pathetic, so returned it. This router is able to reach the corners of the house without much issue.",5
Very useful.. I'm Bass lover.. Aim for high bass.. But this product gives that bass what I expected.. It is so cool. . The quality is so good..one thing don't pull the wire. If u pull the wire.. U loss your hearing. Bcuz the copper wire is cut quickly.. So use it carefully.. Some reviews tells it..if u use more 1 week u have ear pain.. It is a lie answer. . When u inject in phone and increase the volume .. U see the limit of hearing if u cross the limit u ear must damage. . I didn't cross the limit and use the headphones up to 16 hrs but there is no pain . Only one thing u feel. . Your ear pressed towards face. . If u use Contiuesly u can't feel about that..,5
"Im a hardcore developer , and at times likes to play games , this monitor compelled me to write this review as i hate samsung products . This time i had a wide variety to choose from within my budget of 50k. I had chosen , this one , and after buying when i explored its features and options to adjust display , Im very delight at this product.
Using it with my dell 5520 workstation which is 4k itself.
P.S. : Dont get confuse with 144hz and curved screens if you are not hardcore gamer with budget more than 50k for monitor.",5

"I luv this product...total satisfaction i got from this.....Thanks, nice product",5
"Okay to start the review, I have been using Netgear N150 router for last 4 years and this time I needed a new router since devices were increasing in my house (Google chromecast, Google Home, Laptops and mobiles). My netgear router was not able to cover even a 2-BHK and when a lot of devices were connecting at the same time, the chromecast and google home stops working which was such a pain when one person wants to listen music or to steam videos on TV.
So, I finally decided and after reading a lot of reviews of different products zeroed on to this product - TP-LINK TL-WR940N Wireless-N450 Home Router (Mentioning full name since it seems amazon mixes all the reviews of different products of one brand into one list).
Pros -
1- The wifi range is good and comfortably covers my 2 BHK house, even after going some more distance away from home(around 20 meters) I get the range.
2- Able to connect multiple devices (MIMO tech works) (including chromecast, google home) without interruptions.
3- Can easily use this router as wifi range extender as well. A big plus for big homes.
4- T Plink app works fine with the router and you can easily customize settings there.
5- A RJ-45 cable comes inside the box, helps connecting my ACT broadband connection to laptop when there is no power.

Cons-
1. I got used to mutiple lights on my Netgear router, but his one has just single light. Turns blue if wifi connection is working fine and turns yellow if ISP connections breaks. Not a big concern. Just need to get used to it.",5
Best product from BoAT. It's reasonable also. This is my 2nd order for same product.,5

Great experience.,5
D-Link is already a branded thing and this router works as expected,5
Been using the TP-Link ADSL modem router for a few years till it broke down. Warranty claims / RMA is pain in the back with TP-Link and D-Link is no better. Getting a Tech Support personnel over the phone is a mammoth task and this is bought purely as a redundant router to manage the downtime.,5
Excellent Product and as excepted.,5
"As per price does its job, Don't expect 10000/- printer work to do on 2000/- printer, so small work at home and emergency purpose serves well, Does all it need to do and got for that price specially on emergency to print/scan and copy very handful, every house need to have it who have some kind of need.",5

Little hole or small cut is appeared in earphone wire and a bit oils from holes i dont know what is this liquid, sound quality remains unchanged.

"Good one , you can know / calculate all your activities ,, sleep tracking is wonderful you can manage your sleep behaviour ..",5

Fantastic mind blowing ....very good and good product . must buy everyone .,5

"Best phone guys.... it's premium flagship with snapdragon 865 not exynos 990 (iron box)
... just buy it for Samsung pro cameras premium hardware... I have upgraded to this from iPhone 8 plus... I am not regretting... my friends iPhone 12 and s20 fe 5g can be compared... it means it got such a brilliant camera... please checkout pics....

My review points

1. Display- 120hz from Samsung is super
2. Network reciption: same sim in iPhone 8 plus crying to catch good signal in my home... this phone got good network reception and 4g+ is proper...
3. Call quality: as told in point 2 network reception and wifi calling, call quality is superb with good mic and noise canceling ,it's pleasant, was in continus calls for 2hours.
4. Gaming: easily I could launch and play asphalt 9.. it's nice feel in this display with fast sampling rate.
5. Processor: very fast and quick some time I get heat at camera . Hope update may fix or due to case not sure
6. Display: very smooth 120hz is promising amold by Samsung, awesome HD
7. Speakers: Dolby stero speakers they are crisp ad not loud or harsh
8. Front camera: I am not a selfi lover but it's good and tries to capture Natural without any beautification, may be due to this sometime Pic is bit dull, same was in my iPhone 8 plus
9: battery: I used to get 7 hours screen time with 120hz and continus usage
10. charging : charger is just 15 w in box it charges 100 p by 1 hr 15 min ( you can invest for 25w charger phone supports 25w)
11. One ui : very nice light weight and only Samsung apps no bloatware
12. Wifi and Bluetooth speed very fast
13. Ip68 rating is awesome
14. Supports 9 5g bands, future ready compared to one plus iq007 with just 2 or 1 sa/nsa band

Cons:
1. Charging speed
2. No dynamic amoled

It's a good buy and all-rounder flagship with snappy from snapdragon

All snapdragon lovers best phone, u won't regret it",5

5. Sports modes that need like running, walking, cycling, etc
6. BP, Sleep monitor etc
7. Call, sms, app notification
8. Clear and easy operation
9. Customer watch face
So, these are the things that I love in this watch.

"The earphones in itself are nice but they do not support surround noise cancellation in microphone. Also the microphone itself sometimes has issues as it muffles one's own voice. Other than that, the sound quality is pure magic, have been using them from past 6 months and the quality is without a doubt far better than it's competitors. Would recommend it if you like bass.",5

So I choose this which completely satisfy my requirements. It's easy to assemble and ready to use. It's 22"" display play most significant role with this budget. I really satisfying enjoying viewing cinemas in this monitor. And also I am a fan LG which has a famous and quality brand in all products.. A great expections is I had it in during delivery time that is package type and package quality because we are eagerly waiting to receive a product if any damages happens, then it. Will be a most sad situation. In this I m really thanks to Amazon to deliver a wonderful product with quality package and safe package.",5
good sound worth for money,5
Heating problem,5
After a lot of review researching and price check I took a decision to buy this Monitor and I have to say that I am very satisfied with my decision of buying it. The anti glare technology works so amazing and that's a plus point while I edit my pictures in a bright lit room with no reflection. The colour quality (RGB) is also perfect and the viewing angles are great what else do you need in a monitor at this price. I haven't tried my hands in gaming but would definitely like to try it. But for now I am totally satisfied with the product.,5

"Great buy and awesome sound quality at such an amazing price ,,,,,,,",5
It's like a power bank connected to the modem or router. Instantly switches the power source so you never feel interrupted during power fluctuations. But at this cost home desktop ups comes which can be universal for all Ur devices. Other than that it's much helpful for work from home people's I recommend strongly if u want to be connected always. Backup comes for couple of hours built is normal.,5

"Excellent router !
I'm using it for 10days. Working perfectly, wifi signal for TV and 2.4band devices is really awesome. No signal strength logging observed even when we move to another room. 5.0 GHz band is excellent for my 4k TV either with wired or wireless. Tether app interface is good, but it's showing wrong netspeed data. We better depend on other netspeed floating widgets or apps in PC or TV. Very happy to buy this product.",5
Very good.Nice  very good,5
"One sight of this earphones is not work (after using 6 months) when I call there help center the Number is not available at this time , they gave warenty but I don't know how I am replace this product. And they don't have any show room in my city it's very critical to replace it",5
"Thoroughly satisfied in the 2 days I've been using the router. Every inch of my 1200sqft home is fully covered when I place the router in a central room.

The setup took a few hours of trial and error since I wasn't fully sure about the configuration of my local Internet provider, but I finally managed to get it working by just following the configuration wizard that comes with the CD. Serves me right for ignoring the glaring red warning label imploring me run the wizard from the CD before attempting to connect to the router.",5
"Awesome sound quality.best budget home theater from Harman.bass quality just awesome, dialogues are very clear and 3d sounds are just unbelievable clear in high volume. Don't think just buy it. But after 7 months of use my left side speaker is not working it's coil was burnt and I was replaced that coil from my near store",5
"Great purchase, till now no defects and no problems the picture quality is good and seamlessly can opt from hdmi1 to hdmi2 and even to vga on one click button",5
"I purchased this laptop for 24500 which is a total steal for this laptop. Ryzen 3 works fine, don't expect to run heavy applications or games on it. 4gig of Ram and 1Tb HDD is also great for the price. The screen is a total plus point, its an FHD screen, it's a VA panel I guess but for anyone, it's much much better than those 768p HD displays. It is sharp and great to look at. Not good with the viewing angles (obviously a VA panel), but it is good enough.
The speaker is fine and the keyboard is also fine for me. The battery life also seems to be okay with about 3-4 hours of backup. Only get this laptop if you are a normal user that does browsing, watching movies and typing or for basic office use, do not expect more than that.
What I would suggest is to increase the ram to 8 gigs and if you can, please replace the HDD with a 2.5 inch SSD. Just by doing these 2 things, it will run much more smoothly than you can even imagine.",5
Good at this price point and my recommend blue colour is very good colour combination,5
Wonderful! Value for money,5

Very good produced,5
"The noise cancellation is superb and the keys are functional in many ways! The volume up - increases volume, (long press) plays the previous song; volume low - reduces volume, (long press) plays next song. The power button along with answering and ending calls, calls back on last dialled number on double press. And you can also adjust the wire length. Sound quality is great. really loving this product, thanks Amazon for a great service",5
The camera quality is great. Night vision is superb. Motion detection is accurate,5
"Easy to install, but there are times the signal strength is awesome but sometimes it‚Äôs not that great, not sure if that is due to the service provider. But signal strength is much better than the previous router.",5
The laptop is actually great. I loved setting it up..it's very responsive. Excellent for online classes types! Application. But the issue is the seller.. I noticed the camera didn't work..that too at the end after paying for anti virus..which I will not get back..I later noticed some stains. Near the F4 key and on the top of my laptop( I didn't add that picture) I found it and reported it to the Amazon contact center centre team. They really understood my problem and were willing to refund. The point is Amazon is superb. The laptop is superb. The seller needs a kicking. My hard earned money after being a covid positive and removed.. spent so much on medical support. And now this from the seller..wanted to write ..the laptop is superb!.,5
Nyc band totally love it,5
"If you have never used a dail-up modem, it might be difficult for you to get this working.

"The modem comes with a wireless switch off /on button and a network cable, which is very useful for me. I don't have to turn on wireless when I am using it only on my PC. Also, the wireless signal in my living room is quite good while the modem is in my kid's bed room. Another thing I did recently was to enable a guest network without authentication for connecting a guest device temporarily. It was really so easy with the web interface and I didn't have to restart the modem as well.",5

"I didn‚Äôt really pay attention to upgrading my router till now, and I had been only on a 802.11n router (TP-Link MR3420) till today, though almost all my devices are 802.11ac capable. Last week, I decided to upgrade my router, and was doing my research on routers. I didn‚Äôt want to get an AX (WiFi 6) router right now, cos they were expensive, and it would be at least another 2 years before I could get my first WiFi 6 device, and at least another 5-6 years before ALL my devices are WiFi 6 capable. So it didn‚Äôt make sense to pay a premium for a WiFi 6 router right now.

So I landed on this Archer A10 router, as this seemed to be perfect for my needs, with a very good value for money (got it for Rs.6999/-). Also, this router had a high speed on the 2.4GHz, and I felt that was important as well. I installed it, with conservative expectations of its range. But when I took my iPad around the house to test the signal strength, I was amazed. Here are my observations compared to my old router (for reference, my house is around 7000 sft; 2 floors totally; router is placed on the first floor, at a central location; and the router position of both old and new routers is the same; I use a 150 Mbps fiber broadband connection):

Signal Strength setting on the router:
- of 2.4GHz network on old router - ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù
- of 2.4GHz network on Archer A10 - ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù
- of 5GHz network on Archer A10 - ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù

Range and Speed of 2.4GHz network on the old TP-Link router:
The main router gave a coverage of almost 65% of the house. I had to use a range extender to extend coverage to other parts of the house, where signal from the main router was very weak. Speed tests used to give me around 100Mbps when I‚Äôm near the router, but only around 20Mbps in my bedroom, etc.

Range of 2.4GHz network on Archer A10:
Was amazed! This one router covers the entire house! I dont have to use a range extender any more! I‚Äôm able to get 2 bars out of 3 even in the far reaches of my house. Never expected this honestly! Speed test gives me around 40Mbps at the far reaches of my house, and almost 100Mbps everywhere else. Cannot be happier!

Range of 5GHz network on Archer A10:
This network worked well in all parts of the house, except in the far reaches of the house. But this is expected of a 5GHz network, as it doesn‚Äôt easily pass through concrete floors and walls. So I was able to accept it. Got speeds of almost 150Mbps in areas where I got 3 out of 3 bars. Got speeds of around 70Mbps in areas where I got 2 out of 3 bars signal.

In other words, the range of the 5GHz network on Archer A10, was almost at par to the range offered on the 2.4GHz network on my old router. The range and speed of the 2.4GHz network on Archer A10 was FAR superior than the 2.4GHz range on my old router.",5

The signal is pretty good and covers all corners of my 1700ft flat.

"These are amazingly good earphones. The sound quality is really clear and loud and so is the voice quality of the microphone. I use them regularly for my work and entertainment- for online meetings and then for watching movies etc. These are being used with mobile, laptop and iPhone with consistent quality.

All these years I had not given much thought to my earphones, and had been using the ones that came with the phone. But this one is way above those in terms of sound quality.

The fit of the rubber plug that came with it is perfect for my hear and they don't fall out at all. My earlier ones used to pop up of the ears very often.

They do seem a bit prone to damage, but that means you just avoid rough usage.

They are so good that, I got a pair for a friend of mine and he too is very happy with them.",5

great cheap printer,5
"Did a lot of research in this specific area and I should say, GOQii did beat all of the expectation here. Right from the accuracy to the feel on hand and to the overall app experience, it has been definitely a good hit so far!

What I like?
- Interface on the watch
-Accuracy of measurement
-Seamless UX
-Skin temperature measurement - Not to be found in any other product around
-Responsiveness of the device
-Battery life

What could have been better for me?
-Dial size could have been a little more smaller - especially a big wish from the women community out there
-The App has a lot of things inside - I personally do not feel any challenge to find the right thing around, sometimes it feels cluttery, especially when you are in a hurry to find a specific setting to change

Overall, if you are looking for a good smart watch with all the features which tops in realiability - Here is the one for you! Go for it!",5

I am not a tech aficionado but I did my research before buying this product. I router is in a corner in one of the rooms of my 3000 sq. ft. house but I get excellent reception in entire house (2 storeys and basement) and about 50 ft. outwards with solid brick walls. Encryption setup is pretty simple. I however do feel that the adapter is not of the best quality.,5

"The monitor has a great built quality and the picture quality is good as well. The monitor is an absolute beast and you won't feel how huge it is unless you have it. The unit that I have got has absolutely no backlit bleeding problem and has very miniscule IPS glow which is actually a good thing as all IPS displays pertains a bit of IPS glow. Moreover, Before buying I was concerned about the warranty as Amazon says that it would be 39 months from the manufacturing date or 36 months from the date of purchase whichever is closest so I was concerned that what if I would get a model that was manufactured way earlier than 2019 as the first availablity of this monitor is in 2017 but my model has a manufacturing date of MAR 2019. If I talk about the display, it is good and the built quality is top-notch. The only con of this monitor are the speakers, they are decent. Also, the product description says that the package would contain the cord and monitor and some reviews says that the power cord provided is not Indian style but in my case it turned out false, and the package also include the HDMI cable so no need to buy HDMI cable along with it.",5
Met the expectations. Wifi transfer of photos is cool feature.,5
"Worth for price. Good for online class, watching YouTube, listening music, etc. But in case of gaming it delays a little bit so not recommend for gaming purposes. And sound quality is worth for price.",5

Amazon customer service was excellent even my family lives in small town near Porbandar they delivered before time.

"Canon has introduced an entry-level DSLR with a 24.1MP sensor alongside connectivity features such as Wi-Fi and NFC.

An unapologetically simple beginner-level DSLR.

2017-2018 has been the year of the smartphone. Not only design, display and battery, but more of a cold war on the photography front. Smartphone manufacturers all out to show their prowess with the cameras on their devices. Be it the primary or the selfie cameras, the smartphone today is completely bridging the gap between a professional camera and a smartphone. However, what a DSLR can procure, a smartphone simply still cannot. DSLR cameras are still the king when it comes to image quality. Moreover, when you need to take complete control over your frame and the light you capture, no smartphone has yet managed to come close to the performance that DSLRs can offer. While smartphones can replace point and shoot cameras to an extent, they are soon closing into the DSLR category, but that will take a few more years to come.

Professional photographers still use the mighty old DSLR for their work. While they do use smartphones to capture a few shots, the photos cannot be worked on due to limitations of file format (JPG) as RAW images are the ones helps in editing. Hence the DSLR, together with the various lenses, are still here to stay.

While it is definitely a difficult job for camera manufacturers is to sell their products in a market that is soon being dominated by smartphone cameras, brands such as Canon, Sony, Nikon and a few others have established their name in the market and offer products that are aimed at different audiences, different budgets, and different photography skill sets.

This year, Canon announced the EOS 1500D and the EOS 3000D, both entry-level cameras, with almost similar features aimed at budding photographers who want to enter into the photography game for a more serious form of the art, rather than use their smartphones that offer very limited capabilities.

The Canon EOS 1500D replaces the dated EOS 1300D that was released back in 2016. This time, it comes with features such as a 24MP APS-C sized CMOS sensor capable of full HD video recording, burst shooting at 3fps, 9-point AF system and Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity. We put the Canon EOS 1500D to the test so that we can give you our recommendation.",5
Worth it.... simple n easy,5
"Excellent Product For this Price, Value For the Money and easy to install.",5

Router is very good in this price segment.,5
"Best monitor you can buy in this price range. I wanted a QHD monitor since 4k is limited on content and need proper GPU to run smooth ( issue with office laptops). This monitor has excellent colors, contrast, viewing angles and ports. I got it for 25k and run great on 75Hz at 2k.

HDR playback is also very good( tested on youtube), people saying you need 1000 nits for proper HDR need to check again since HDR has different standards. A reputed company like LG won't say its HDR without proper certification.",5
"The phone is very good for single hand use.
The screen size is perfect for watching videos.
Design of the phone is also good.
We r getting type C charger out of the box and it also supports fast charging.

"Pro -
1. Huge battery - 5000mah Hustle free usage for 48 hours +

3. Goodness of SAMSUNG GALAXY M11 still have 3.5 mm headphone jack. It is easy to connect with our current headset
4. Best camera for this price range - 13 MP f/1.8 for standard wide + 5 MP f/2.2 for Ultrawide + 2 MP f/2.4 for DOF
5. Comes with Android 10.0 . the 4GB RAM adds quick and smooth usage of apps

Cons -

1. Face ID does not all the time
2. Could have add headphones",5
"Bought this item on 24th Dec 2020. I bought this to replace Netgear WNR612 router since it was only 150 MBps and power was low and not reaching other rooms.

Pros:
Looks good, installation procedure is given in detail, can act as repeater, router etc.
The internet speed test showed upto 80 to 90 MBps - not that bad.
None can access the login of the router with standard password since it has its own special password pertaining to the instrument - Safety is assured.
For all the above - 5 Starts
BUT:
Negative:
When I was trying to connect this, even with tplinkwifi.net, D-link page is shown -- Something strange.
Though the instructions were given, I had some difficulty in connecting the router - is not so easy!
Often the wifi connection gets cut which gives lot of trouble for attending online classes or watching movies.
For the above technical problems - 1 star

Average: 3 star

Ordered for replacement today (26Dec). I may not see any improvement, if these problems are inherent to the design. Let us see whether it can solve the problem of intermittent lose of signal.

Got the replacement next day. For the past two days (30Dec2020), we are not experiencing any intermittent outages.

So, I have changed the stars to 5.",5
Fingerprint quick respond....also battery backup & camera quality is very good....,5
"Everything is Okay but when i opened it, cover of Black ink bottle was damaged. Either I have no time to replace it or return it.

5. Full Coverage In 300 Gaj House.
6. Beamforming Is Here For Expend Coverage Area.
7. Speed Is Great.
8. Ping Lies Between 6-10 Mostly.

10. Both 2.4 & 5GHz Is Enable.
11. 1GHz Dual Core Processor With 128 MB RAM.

"Awesome product in this price range... Actually almost reviews are absolutely wrong since many are not doing the proper settings which mentioned in the owners manual and even the technical team of stores doesn't have knowledge to configure the System with proper manner
Pros:
1)The System has the Complete configuration setting in menu
Surrounding speakers we can set accordingly by distance, Volume level by each and we should do the configuration according to the room size for better outcomes
2)Dolby digital is perfect and crystal clear if we set the all in menu
3)Have the sub woofer and system volume control seperatly
4)It has the decent sound with good bass and Dolby digital with supporting almost all digital formats
5)After doing the configuration the dolby is perfectly working even with you toube also and HD channels in the peak performance
6)Remote has almost all settings including we can control surrounding speakers through menu
7) surrounding speakers have 6 MTR each wire which is enough to fix proper places
8)HDMI ARC working perfectly with detailed Sound quality
Cons:
Overall nothing but remote has little lagg and some times hard to press
First 15 days I couldn't feel any good sound and I was about to return the product but later I understood the settings and it's works wonderfully... Sellers must arrange demo and installation with proper person who know the configuration which I didn't got from Reliance Digital and I was blamed Sony for the product initially

NOW I AM HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT SUPER IN CLASS... Recommend for budget customers but should do the proper configuration",5

"Dear sir,
It is to apprise you that I have received the product. But it seems that there is a manufacturing defect in the said product. Problem is - 1) When I pluggin the said product using power adaptor, the power button does not glow, 2) The third button indicating earth is glowing. 2) The WIFI indicator also does not glow when I switch on the wifi button. The saddest part is that I lost the bills due to sweeping of rooms by house keepers.
But I feel or like to raise a complaint is that sellers should at least inspect the product using power adaptor whether the product is working or not. If it is working, then only it should be dispatched. I therefore would like to ask seller - Is there any way to repair / replace the said product or not. How would like to suggest or give solution to this case. Beside, I am sure that it may be manufacturing defect, so it may not be fault of seller. Thats why, I am giving 5-star.

With regards

"Well writing this review after thoroughly testing each feature.,Philips never compromised on the sound quality of their products..Have been using Philips audio systems since a very very long time..The expectation of products from Philips are huge as the build quality of Philips is way beyond comparison..After listening to audio from Philips 5.1 Home theatre audio systems was quite sceptical about buying a 2.1 speaker system but Philips proved me wrong..This is an awesome product designed by Philips the Bass is immersive, the audio quality is awesome and is very pleasant to listen.
Very satisfied with the quality.. Got it for around 10k after discount and card offer thanks to Amazonüòä
Pros:
1.Bass level can be increased up to 30 max but would recommend to not go beyond 18/20.
2.System volume operating range is up to 30 max.
3.Different equaliser modes available.
4.Can play audio from USB,In built FM receiver,Aux input,Optical in,Bluetooth..
5. Speakers can be used as tower speakers or as sound bar..
6.Special mention the sub-woofer is true performer from Philips as always.
7.The sound output is superb even at volume level 2 and bass level 4/6, it‚Äôs really pleasant to listen at this range at night times offcourse with ur fav playlistüòä
Cons:
1.Remote plastic quality is not acceptable from a giant like Philips could have been better -No offence
2. Could have provided treble control but that doesn‚Äôt defer the quality of the sound output it‚Äôs just to mention consumers can adjust it according to their choice of treble level.",5
"Go for the product without any second thoughts!! Great notice cancellation, awesome bass and absolutely amazing beats. Does not miss any beat of music!! Just go for it. The mic is also great. Overall product is amazing.",5

"Its been almost 1 week using this phone. Bought this for my mother.
This phone is much faster than other exynos based samsung phones. Camera quality is more than average and gets the job done with good clarity.
Battery works for 1.5-2 days depending on usage.
The display could have been better though. Still it is of good quality. Speaker is louder and sounds great. The price is little bit more than other competitors but it‚Äôs okay as it‚Äôs not a Chinese phone. My opinion is you should go for it than buying an oppo vivo or redmi phone. You will get a much secured phone than these Chinese brands",5

The headphones at this range are very adorable and worth for its price. It has a good quality of sound i am not saying the loudness but about the details which you can catch gives a theatre type sound effect (3D/ surrounding). Supports fast charging also as mentioned Mic quality is extremely good. The pad/cushion is really soft and you can use the headphones for a longer period without any pain. Works best with aux.,5

Value for Money smart watch,5
"Awesome product in under 1k, too loud to handle as I like to listen on lower side of the volume for the benefit of my ears and hearing ability in the long run, good connectivity, great battery life, need to charge it only after 4-5 days when I m using it 2-3 a day, nice padding around the earpices as they cover up entilre earand sit on the skull so no pressure on the earlobe even if used for longer time, the best part is that there is no it hing or discomfort because of the sound.

The bass and volume is very good, at full volume, you can use it as a speaker if you wish, just the volume buttons are reverse than one expects, the lower one is at the top and the higher one is at the bottom of the buttons.

Picking a call is tricky, because it blares at full volume which is too loud for the ears, its like an explosion; makers should do something to keep it at medium or last set level for receiving calls.",5
"I had the high end Wifi router previously which supports 5 GHz which suddenly stopped working then I have to buy this Wifi router just for time been until I search and buy a high-end Wifi router.

This router kind off do the job instantly with respect to setup and installation, it took me less than 30 sec in setting it up then 3-4 clicks for Quick Setup of dynamic IP.

I have been using it since couple of weeks now and it is quite OK.

If you expect that it would work seamlessly and stream HD video than you should go for high end router, this one is for basic use which supports 2 GHz with limited wifi range.

A big thumbs up on the price with respect to the quality and it‚Äôs usability.

If you find the review useful, consider clicking helpful!",5

"Perfect and a very good quality printer. The speed for black and white pages is good, although color print out speed is not so good. However, a high color print speed should not be expected from a compact ink tank printer for home use. Installation is easy and clearly mentioned on the instruction guide. Wifi connectivity can be easily established as per the instruction guide. Epson iPrint app needs to be downloaded on your mobile for direct mobile-to-printer print command. For desktop/laptop, either download the same app or install the application from the CD given. Scanning and photocopying works well. Epson genuine ink cost is ver less compared to HP. Overall, a value for money product as compared to similar other printers esp. HP or Brother.",5

"The power bank/UPS for router is very useful product. You just don't realise it's benifits unless you're using it. Been using these in all my network equipment for over an year. Resonate provides quality products and these perform even better than what is said on the site. Routers, switches and load balancer all run for over 6 hours and haven't had any internet downtime since I started using then. It's much more efficient than using a regular UPS which first converts 240 volts AC to 12 volts DC then from 12 volts DC to AC, which is inefficient in itself.",5
Good mid range phone with 5G connectivity. Although 5G phones are basically useless in India right now as 5G won't be available in 2021.,5
"The best flagship of the year with a lot of powerful features packed in the phone.
1 Love the e-sim
2 powerful processor
3 awesome quality display
4 Camera specially 10x optical zoom
5 very good macro photo capabilities
6 got buds pro at rs990 was really good complement.
7 faster fingerprint reader secure ultrasonic and many more daily useful features.
I see a lot of overheating complaints but never had any issues after I updated the firmware immediately and cleared cache partition. Though first setup will heat a bit but thats not an issue. After update and calibration and usage of 7 days the battery adapted well and learned usage patern and now backup is awesome with everything turned on lasts 1 day with about 6 hrs of sot.
So overall I am very satisfied with this phone.",5

I purchased this product. this product meets my expectation. It's design is elegant. It supports for eye care mode which is good. Overall product is satisfactory to me. the build is good and minimalist,5
"It is a very good product, at this affordable price.",5
A very good product from Noise. The battery backup in this smart fitness watch is the best. The response of the touchscreen is also good. The price is one of the major factor that influenced me to buy this watch. It also has features like relax mode etc.,5
"This router gives me very good internet speed even in rooms that are almost 10 meters away and not in the line of sight. I have a 50Mbps broadband and I get 53Mbps speed whether I'm next to the router or 10 meters away and not in the line of sight ,so pretty good I'd say. Also the advanced features offered in this are also very exhaustive, as you go farther away the Wi-Fi signal automatically shifts from 5Ghz to 2.4Ghz to provide better range while compromising on speed (which is expected).",5
Lovely things,5

"This one is an excellent upgrade from the entry level TP-Link routers like TL-WR840N. Range is much better compared to these devices. Also, the dual band capability provides a relief from running a mix of new and old devices that run on a specific bands of frequency.
I am still using the TL-WR840N as a Range Extender to extend the 2.5ghz. Remember that the A5 AC1200 doesn't have the range extender feature.",5
"Go for it if u get a good deal
Pros
1 cannon best lenses support
2 WiFi connectivity for sharing
3 ease of use
Cons
1 not as user friendly as 34/3500 D
2 bulky",5
"It is been 5 years that I bought this product and still this router is working like a new one. I live in a 2 bhk flat the signals doesn't show any sign of disruption or weakness. Installation is very very easy with the help of quick guide you install this device and get connected to internet in few minutes.
If you want a descent wifi connection like watching youtube videos playing pubg mobile than it is good to go.
But for any streaming purpose it not that good.
Durablity is not an issue at all as this product entered its 5th year in use and still working fine.
For a budget route this is good.

But the size is very small.
It has 1 antenna.
It has only one LAN and one WLAN slot.

Rest everything is fine with this.",5

Used boat 225, mi sub 700 earphones, mi basics sports bluetooth-1300(stopped working 5th month due to my lazyness just ignored then it cost me no warrenty (taken to mi service and they just said they can't do anything because no warranty.
I don't recommend any brands just buy what you want.
For me cheapest good earphones is this boat bassheads 100 so if anything bad happens I have 1 year warranty I can replace(by this boat support website and register complaint ticket) it takes just 2 mins.

"Hi Friends,

So far I have used n numbers of earphones whose avg cost is 2K+ (all of those are award-winning in their categories).

I got it @ 350 , so thought let's try it out. And believe me, it has blown my mind and ears. Its sound is really great.

I am writing this reviews to especially college goers, because I know we generally face cash crunch during that period. No need to burn your hard cash for expensive earphones. Blindly go for it.

About overall sound quality + bass + beats,
9/10 compare to 2K+ award-winning headsets.",5

"Not gonna lie, this exceeded my expectations. Pretty much the best you could buy under 10K (I got it for 9400/- )

You could not tell the difference between 75Hz and 60Hz however when I do switch to my laptop which has a 60Hz display, after working on the monitor, I could feel some lag. So, smooth display on this monitor. It gets really bright too, I keep it at 15% only since anything above 30 is too bright for me.

Obviously not for eSports gaming, because of the response time and refresh rate.",5
Nice product with less priz.... nice bass....,5
Only one word its excellent,5
Couldn't really pair using mobile but was able to pair with Mac using wifi Direct. Very limited instructions provided.

Product is good and value for money must say but there is 2 thing which needs to be taken care ASAP and people should be aware before taking it. making account and loggin in to MI is a pain and mind it it taker more than 30 min to do so and charging the strip is not always good and usally it pop out of rht charging adapter so need to put a little weight gto make it possible but as of now all is good expect these 2 point thats nees to be taken care,5

"Dell Monitors are best in the market. I had been using 1. Dell 2208WFP (almost 9 years old) and 2. Dell U2717D (few months old). I wanted to replace 2208WFP and came across this amazing monitor and awesome deal. You can't get this monitor in any stores at this price and of course I can bet on that! Apart from the price, quality is amazing. I am happy with the product. This monitor comes with 3 years of warranty from Dell.
It came with the following cables:
1. USB 3.1 upstream cable.
2. Display Cable and
3. Power Cable.
One thing everyone needs to understand is - we all buy things keeping future in mind and also thinking that the things I can do with it. For. example I would order a monitor thinking that I would play games on it but the real question is am I seriously going to play games or that's just one of the assumptions? Thought this monitor should work flawlessly on games too. It has beaten many monitors in 24 inch category heads down. The build quality is awesome too! I strongly recommend this monitor.",5
Ok,5
"Everything is good, only issue is with adapter it stopped working after few days. I tried calling customer but it was after order replacement deadline. So they didn't helped here. So I have to purchase a new adapter, then only it started working again.

"Its the best router at the given price.

I was using MTNL provided modem+wi fi router before purchasing this. But the coverage was limited to line-of sight areas in my 1600 sqft apartment. Hence needed a modem cum router with better wi-fi range.

The wireless-AC routers were very costly plus none of my devices are AC compatible hence chose this wireless-N router. The speed was noticeably better. The range is good and now covers the 3 bedrooms partially. The number of bars (signal) drops down to one but the speed remains decent.

I also tried another costly router with 3 x 5dbi antennae but the range was only a bit better (did not cover the bedrooms entirely) but the price was more than twice this D-Link beauty.

I will surely recommend this router to people looking for modem + wi fi router functionality for home use.",5
"Good product
All functions working just perfectly
I'm happy with this purchase",5

"I live in a 5BHK Duplex house which is covered with Google Mesh in the ground floor but has bad signals in the first floor where i live. I used to face chronic WIFI drops and very slow speeds for a 250 MBPS line which i had.

Was looking for an affordable solution to end my WIFI woes and TP Link Archer has seemed to solved my problem.

PROS:
1. Very good range (1000sft+)
2. Almost full speed at close range (250mbps on 5GHZ)
3. Intelligent Connect (Connects to 5G or 2G WIFI depending on device and wifi strength without the need to change networks)
4. Easy to setup/use (Less than 1 minute to set up)
5. VFM - Haven't found a better router at this price.

CONS:
1. Could not find any cons so far, long term reliability is unknown and needs to be seen.",5
"Phone is ok types but after a month of using,the battery life sucks big time. Even after full charge the battery does not last very long. I don't play any games etc, just whatsapp and normal calls.",5

Just what I expected. Upto the mark.,5
Good result,5
"Been using this phone for over a month now, and have shifted from a Redmi. Bought it on sale with exchange, so the total price was under 20k. I am a moderate user - mostly using it for social media, videos, and reading, and use it about 4 hours a day. I don't play games nor do I use particularly battery/RAM heavy apps.

Pros:
-Sleek and modern appearance. Heavy-ish, but I like that.
-BATTERY life. With moderate usage, my phone easily lasts three days, max four without charge.
-Amazing, sharp display. Other phones seem quite dull in comparison
-Fast, no lags, smooth interface. Easily switches between tasks and apps without slowing down.
-Amazing camera (BUT front camera can add a lot of redness to the face, and the back camera can get a bit grainy in low light)
-Customisable appearance and skins (not a fan of Samsung's in-built OS look)
-Quick face and fingerprint scanner (but the location on the side can be a slight nuisance if you're just trying to hold the phone when not in use. You get used to it.)

Cons:
-Glasstic back attracts a LOT of scratches and fingerprints, so if you are particular about that (I'm not), you'll need a cover.
-Sound and sound quality could be better and louder.

Meh:
-OS and features. OS is fairly similar to the original Android, and there are not a lot of cool features and little details that I found were there in my Redmi.

Overall, I kind of love the phone. The cons aren't really deal-breakers for me, but I do think for the price they could have worked a bit more on the OS and the features. All other specs are great. I'm hoping to use it for a few years at least.",5
"Good Accuracy in SO2 measurement and temperature measurement...

I have been using it for 2 years now. It totally the best product for this price. No issue so far. Its been 2 years now and it was used roughly. It fell atleast 10 times so far and no complaints. Only issue is the coating of cushion pad started to come off after a year which is somewhat okay. Its not uncomfortable even after the coating came out. Just a thin layer came out.,5
Conventional use of network connectivity,5
"Its a best pocket frendly product for those really want a good health
Its easy to use
Must have produt
Very nice",5
"If you want a good router that is OneMesh compatible, this is a good option. It has an inbuilt VPN service too. The smart connect feature in this router balances speeds by switching the connection band between the 5GHz and the 2.4GHz networks to a device according to the distance in between. The QoS feature along with the MU-MIMO capability and the Qualcomm CPU, the load balance and optimisation is very nice. Ranges are pretty good, with a 20dB antenna, this is good for a big hall and 3 adjacent rooms. Make sure you place it at the centre of your house.

All ports are gigabit and the router is very stable. It is also Alexa capable.",5

Mu story with this izs long... 1 week before I ordered boat rockers 450 and it came on time and I was excited because it was my first bluetooth headphone.. but I found that the right side of the headphone's sound is low compared to the left one and a vibrating sound came out of the right side of the headphone. So I returned it and now I got a new headphone and I tested it, it is awesome. Nice quality üëå. according to me its Comfortable for me. One thing I noticed was it already seal opened. But No defects üòÅ. Thank u Amazon and boat",5

Gud as per cost - Its cheapest so dont expect miracle. Its ok for the rate but if u r luking for extra bass well then spend more. Ear fitting is also not that comfortable.,5
"Very budget friendly yet very economic printer. We get auto duplex printing below 10k price range which is the main point inspired me to purchase this one after reviewing so many printer models from different brands.
One may think that cartridge type inkjet printer may not be economoc when compared to ink tank inkjet printers. Well partially it is true when your printing volume is very high compared to occassional printing.
One thing is that this model comes only on white. Hence, care has to be taken to keep it clean. Setting it up is very very easy. Before everything you have to download hp smart app in your phone. It supports Bluetooth printing also. Hence, turn on the Bluetooth first, open hp smart amd it will detect your printer. Once hp smart detects it it will ask for you to setup wifi connection for your printer. Requirement of laptop is not essential to setup this printer. That is one of the biggest point of buying it. A mobile/tablet/ipad is enough to get things done.",5
"Great Battery Life 30‚ÑÖ still left after month of use, display bright visible in sunlight, waterproof no problem, band is comfortable for continuous use with feeling to remove, great combination with mi scale",5

Very good and esthetic design. The neck band is flexible and smooth it is great for users. I'm very happy after it's performance. Value for money. You Must purchase rather than other brands....Thank you Amazon.,5
Looking more premium than my expectations if you are going to buy this under thousand rupees it's a great deal,5

"I bought this for Rs 2500. My honest review on using this for 2 weeks.
1) It is one of the best camera at this budget. It provides 360' degree tilting from left to right and vice versa, also up and down view is available.
2) Clarity provides 1080 pixel, which you can't get in normal security camera especially at this budget(2500rs).
3) It doesn't record the idle position, and captures any small movements. It only records if there is a movement, which is a good feature. Also it provides constant notification for every movement. Even it is a small flies it captures that too and sends the notification to mobile.
4) You just need a wifi and power point.
5) Draw back is if someone steals the camera, then you can't see anything, because everything is recorder in camera's sd card.
Even if you switch off or it doesn't get wifi you can't view or download anything.
6) if you are placing this inside the gate then it is a good option.
7) another feature is it also records the voice.
8) I inserted 128 gb sd card on this.
My review is 5/5",5
"Unbelievable quality product at this low price. Sound quality is far better than many topmost branded earphones. Bluetooth connectivity is very stong, Noise cancellation is also very good.

4.I didn't felt any inconvenience after listening the music for an hour,also the buds fits properly in the ear.
Overall I would give a rating over 10.
1.Sound quality and loudness:9/10

"Zebronic is phone Wireless BT Headphone Comes with 40mm Drivers, AUX Connectivity, Built in FM, Call Function, 9Hrs* Playback time and Supports Micro SD Card (Black)Clear
Best product.",5
Sound quality is how good,5
It's superb.. Go for it.,5
"I'm using it from 24 th sept, 2018. After almost 1.8 year I am reviewing it. In my opinion it's best earphone I 've ever had. I'm using it 1.8 years roughly. Nothing happened. But now it's mic nearer wire has broken. No it's not JBL 's fault. It's only my fault. Now come to sound quality
1) Crystal clear sound
2) Not extra bass, rich bass

Now come to design
1) Light weight
2 ) wire is more durable
3) mic is on right side( preferred by me)

Cons:
Chose your perfect size of bud , if not you can't wear this for long time

One more thing I bought it for 649 but in big indian sale in October it's price comes to 549
So try to buy this that time, otherwise you will pay extra money. I request all buyers to write their price of buying. It became easy for new buyer to buy in correct price.

Overall good earphone üëçüèº",5
"Excellent Product, Thank You Amazon.",5
"Excellent for the price. The plastic and wires look a bit flimsy but the price, sound quality and the comfortable fit more than make up for it. I would a good purchase, but handle it just a little more carefully than you would normally.",5

The phone is a good one to use. It is a 6.5 inch but is handy to use for its balance. It has a 6000 mah battery which gives it a great battery backup with a decent fast charger. It has also a good UI( One UI 3.0). Overall it's a good smartphone which can beat some flagship phone too.,5

Worth buying.",5
"Been using this monitor for over 6 months and I think it was the best in it‚Äôs category.

For Gaming: Great @ 60 Hz, Bad because I was getting another monitor by LG which was supporting 75 Hz. But again the Gaming Monitor by LG had so many issues like dead pixels, glare and etc.

In short this monitor is okay if you own a GTX 1050 Ti or lower since most of the games run @ 60FPS with that card. Get a 144 Hz monitor with a GTX 1060 or higher.

For working: Perfect, no issues at all. No flickering, no dead pixels, work non stop without any annoyance.

I‚Äôd give it a 8.5/10

I just removed a few points because the swivel is not actually a swivel, integrated speakers would‚Äôve been amazing.

Please click helpful if you liked my review :)",5
Great phone in this segment.,5
"Ao i don't generally write reviews, but these are THE best headphones that I have used in terms of sound quality. The depth of sound is best in class and bass is simply amazing.

The headphones have excellent noise cancellation and provide an immersive experience. They are quite comfortable, much more than any other headphones in the same price range.

One tip for buyers: I got these for 2500, but a couple of hours before I ordered the price was 3000, so be on the lookout for sudden price movements. Also don't buy the on-ear version of these (it costs about 500 less, as it is not going to be as immersive or comfortable as this one).",5

And app noise fit sport very fantastic..",5

"When our internet service provider changed our network cable from cat5 to cat6 our old router (about 4 year old) started misbehaving. It is allocating entire bandwidth to a single device. We could download gigabytes of data in a few minutes, but during this time all other devices connected to router were chocking for bandwidth.

TP-LINK Archer solved the problem.

- The speed is uniform across multiple devices. At any given point in time 3-4 audio / video calls are going on across multiple devices, no issues so far.
- The signal strength is pretty decent across a duplex house. All these devices are at a distance of about 40 feet across two floors.
- Did not turn off the device in about a month of usage. It is a little warm, no heating issues so far.

Amazon did a great job in delivering the device in less than 12 hours. We ordered around 9:00 pm and the device is in our house around 7:00 am next day!",5

My kids love the new mi band. They wear it all the day including sleep time and sports time. With this COVID being the new new and all activities confined within the houses it motivates the kids to not being couch potatoes. Very happy with this purchase.,5
"Sounds good.
Adequate bass.
Treble was good and not distorted.
Fm radio works just fine.
Overall value for money!",5
"The printer, scanner and copier, all the functions work very smoothly. You need to give it some time after proper setup so that you can get the best possible speed of printing.
Don't fall for negative reviews. People don't understand how the things work in these printers, hence they assume that it doesn't work properly and give negative reviews. Yes, some of them might be genuine issues but I'm sure that not all of them are problematic.
If you find problem in detection of page (wrong page size shown) then it is just because of that blue stopper marker, slide and fit it to the tightness, with the page width, I assure you the wrong page size problem will no longer be the problem anymore.
Use it wisely to get the longest lifespan and also protect ot from dust to achieve the same...
Thank you...",5

"I purchased this around 4 months ago. Used it for 3.5 months continuously. These are the things that I noticed:
Sound quality: 5/5
Crisp, clear and undistorted sound way better than boult loop
Noise cancellation : 5/5
Unmatched
Comfort : 5/5
Most comfortable one out of every earphones I used
Bass : 4/5
Perfect balance of treble and bass. Bass is not like super heavy but it's perfectly balanced. I listen to raps mostly and I think the bass is good enough.
After 3.5 months one earpiece stopped working so I claimed the warranty which was super easy to do. They picked the product same day without any question and get me a brand new with all the accessories + 1 pouch (which I didn't get with my original order) after 1.5 weeks. So kudos to boat in my opinion boat provide the best after sale service.",5

I'm using on my asus zenfone max pro m2 and I clearly heard the sound of enemies even like there were of more than 70 metres so we were easily wiping them. Played 2 match with a chicken dinner man. The delivery guy was too great to talk to as well. Amazon if you verify the order with comment then do give him a promotion for being so nice to customers. Everything related to this boat headphones is awesome from music playing to playing games like pubg mobile , call of duty etc.",5

"It's a very nice product at really affordable price. Print quality is awesome, installation is hassle free(if you have used HP deskjet/color jet printer before then the installation is pretty basic like other HP printers), very easy to use, latest drivers can be downloaded from hp.com and all the instructions are there on screen while installing the drivers. So everyone can install it without dialing any number. Paper feeding is pretty basic like other desk jet printers, wireless works absolutely fine, there's some latency though but it's negligible. Scan quality is also good and the best part is it can be used both as wired or wireless printer choice is yours. I would say it's the best wireless printer at this price üëç",5

"Using Cisco/Linksys since 2003 so no doubt about their robust quality.

Tested Linksys EA8100 on JioFiber 1gbps line & got 928mbps/934mbps on LAN 1gbps port.

On Wi-Fi 5.0Ghz got 605mbps/432mbps.
On Wi-Fi 2.4Ghz got 376mbps/493mbps.

NOTE:-
1. On LAN only u will get speed better than Wi-Fi.

2. Don't expect 800mbps on 2.4Ghz & 1800mbps on 5.0Ghz if u know Wi-Fi channel n mode settings. COMPANY ALWAYS MENTION HIGHER SIDE SPEED WHICH U CAN GET ONLY WHEN WI-FI IS UNDER 1METER RANGE UNDER PROPER CHANNEL/MODE.

3. You can't get 100% speed of ur internet line on Wi-Fi as interference (other Wi-Fi device, Power line in near, bluetooth, microwave oven frequency etc) is a main negative point in Wi-Fi access. Even neighbour's Wi-Fi too interfere in ur Wi-Fi.

4. You can get either one ""high speed OR Wi-Fi range"" as if Signal increase then speed is low AND if u increase speed via Channel/Mode then Wi-Fi range is low.

5. If u hide the SSID then must face disconnection if u go far from Wi-Fi. Try to disable ""Auto-connect"" from other wifi devices & enable ""Auto-connect"" on desired Wi-Fi only.

OVERALL I m satisfied.
Anyone can ask questions if have it.",5

"It's nice watch for fitness lovers, believe me if you are obese, buy this watch, it will change your daily routine and fitness: it infuses motivation for excerise.
What I did not like watch, its accuracy when not connected to GPS, it miscalculates distances covered. Workout excercises do not always corresponds to rate of calories burned and heart rates. Even when you are doing yoga, heart rate is low, it counts calories burned as usual. It should also alarm sound. There could also be mechanism in watch itself to assess your weight.",5
Excellent product i have been used it for 5 years..and still working excellent,5
"At this price, there's hardly anything to say against the Mi Band 4. It's comfortable, the OLED display is a massive improvement over the previous generations, and I can hardly justify spending five digits worth on a smartwatch when this does nearly the same job (perhaps not as well, granted).
The app works fine, aside from some hiccups while pairing the watch with a new phone, and the activity tracking is fairly accurate, especially when it's using the phone's GPS.
I've been using it for several weeks now, and I've been getting a consistent 15 days between charges (with my usage).
Definitely worth considering if you're in the market for a compact fitness tracker or notifier.",5
Good range and smart switch(switches from 5ghz to 2.4ghz according to closeness.....and if far then 2.4ghz as it provide good range ....) Cover my home which has 2 floor ground and 1st....) Speed is good when nearest (in same room ....some reduction when at ground floor but at bottom to router 30-40mbps out of 50).,5
Nice sound.Very nice prodduct as i expected,5

"I love this D-Link router+modem works very well with my BSNL Broadband connection and guys its one of the best in market and surely a value for your buck and if you're like me a person who loves using internet but when your old modem dies and you dont know how to set up a new one or in professional terms you're not that technical person , believe me this router will surely help you out as the disk inside it is easy to set up in 5-10 mins and you're good to go .

Pros - 1- you can easily set it up on your own
2- Wifi strength very good
3- works very well with any broadband connection ( Mine BSNL )
4- very high specs

Cons - I have nothing bad to say about this product",5
"Very good watch, good sleep tracking",5
goog product,5
"I am a musician and this is the best earphones i have used upto 3k Rs
Including Bluetooth and wired
The sound quality is the best
Just too good
Clarity is so good
Bass is very adequate ; not extra
Just the amount you need
Extra bass destroys the long term listening experience and also affects the clarity
And that's the beauty of this earphone
It has perfectly balanced the sounds

Build Quality -
One of the worst ever
You will have to handle it very carefully otherwise thr wire will break from the bottom end! But you can go and exchange it for 1 year so fair enough

Comparison with Sennheiser Cx180
Sound quality is better in Jbl
I have used both so much
Sennheiser sound degrades after a month of use
Jbl is very consistent in that case
Sennheiser is good for listening acoustic
Jbl is Better for Edm
All over Sennheiser is also very good honestly but Jbl is better in sound quality

Sennheiser doesn't have mic and sound quality degrades so Jbl is overall winner
Build quality is very better on Sennheiser though

Jbl C100si even better than Sennheiser cx275s in sound quality
It wins by a little margin",5
"Seriously I can‚Äôt express my inner feelings....this watching is tooo special for me. I means what I need in smart watch...this watch is giving me all that things like
Call

The best thing is that I can check map or location in the watch",5

Good for basic use and calling. Not for great quality audio . Got it for my friend and he is happy for his requirement.,5
Awesome working laptop for students,5
"Amazing product.
Value for money.
Go for it without giving it second thought.",5
"Overall good product

The pixel density is not great. So image quality will not be to the fullest.
Very easy in adjusting the height and tilt with one hand. But it's a must to use both hands for swivel (rotating the screen on its base). Felt it was a bit heavier than expected, though it didn't pose any problem. USB hub works just fine.

I'm greatly satisfied with the product. I've been using it for programming, browsing and occasional movies.",5
"Certainly, this is the best earphone. Good bass and sound quality.
I am using this from 6 months and since then no complaints/issues have come and it works as good as it worked for first time.
One month back, it got washed in washing machine, I was surprised to see it working smoothly with zero problem/issues.",5

Amazon delivered the product before the estimated time. The modem plus router is working very fine. The WiFi range is very good. One should surely go for this product.,5
Comfortable to wear. I ordered because I had to connect to desktop which is not bluetooth enabled and phone both bluetooth and plugin connectivity works smoothly.,5
Powerful router which transmits signal for a large area. I am using this for 3 floors and I am able to connect.,5

A great value of money and perfect phone for beginner of smart phone users like 90s peoples.good battery life also.,5
"For 400 they are good and sound quality is just fine. They have no brass or noise cancellation feature. But i didn't need them so I got these for regular use. Yes they are durable and it is genuine. Hence I recommend this to all those who watch late night dramas nd doesn't want to get caught. Hehe. JK. But I seriously liked it and got another one for mah sis. Just one suggestion please don't take red one, it looks little tacky. Take light pink, black, white etc.. Red looks cheap. My experience. Thanks.",5
Really amazed with the accuracy and battery life. It's definitely the best fit bit at the lowest possible price. Go for it..,5
