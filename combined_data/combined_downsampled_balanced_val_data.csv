I was not having any high expectations from this router but it fails even at providing the average WIFI router requirements then what would I do with all the advance specs and features in it?

I have asked for the full refund on the 2nd day itself. Mine experience was bad .",1

I am still not able to replace my product.",1
"THE PRINTER IS VERY GOOD PRINT QUALITY IS COMMENDABLE
BUT THE THING THAT STRIKES IS THE COST OF INK REFILL
IT COSTS AROUND 650/- FOR ONE CARTILAGE THAT LASTS ONLY FOR 60-65 PRINTS IN DRAFT QUALITY
BUY A COSTIER PRINTER WHICH MAY HELP YOU TO SAVE INK IN A LONG RUN",1
"Sound and bass quality is not good
And my money is not refund through amazonMy money is not refund through amazon quickly process and refined my money because I m tired nd helpless",1

"Had high expectations from boAt. I had bought it as a gift for my friend. It stopped working within a month, despite being handled with care. Though the product looks great and the sound quality was good, I am upset that I didn't last for long.",1
"I am not sure if i am writing too early i have been using DLink products for years now and this is the first time i am facing an issue and no doubt i am disappointed about it. I recently took a broadband connection from ACT Fibernet which was formerly BEAM Telecom. When i received the Router the first time, it didnt work and was not getting connected and after a lot of trials i returned it back through amazon to get the product replaced.
Disappointed because the replaced product also isn't functioning. In the description part of the router it was written as below: ""Input Type RJ-45 (Ethernet Cable) supported by neighbourhood cable broadband ISPs such as Hathway, ACT, Tikona, Airtel Fibrenet, MyWorld, Nextra, Siti Cable, You Broadband, Spectranet etc."" given that ACT is also a part of the list i fail to understand why it is not working.
I am afraid i would have to return this for a refund.
The above review was written before speaking to customer support @ DLink
After a chat realised that the FIRMWARE was installed for HATHWAY which i feel amounts to cheating the end user/customer.
When someone is purchasing something it should be compatible to any ISP which the customer may have.
Still didnt understand how amazon missed this. Improve your checks so that regular customers like me keep purchasing online on amazon.
A bad experience this has been.",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I brought to gift it to my son as today I his birthday but the product is not charging,and the power button is already pressed inn,requesting for replacement",1
Bought it thinking that it had google operating system.Huge disappointment with battery life 4 to 5 hour which is bummer and after using tizen watch it was like let down.,1
"I purchased with an MRP of 1390/- head set with a discount of 499/- i.e the cost i spent on this is 891/-.
But i received an item with an MRP of 990/- . I felt that i need one head set below one thousand,but i was motivated with this site above 1390/- set will get only 891/-,so i happily purchased but i got only 990/- mrp rate. There must be difference between above 1300/- product and below 1000/-, and also volume,quality wise. So dont purchase one star is also waste for this low volume product",1
"Useless product. earlier i was getting good speeds. once i connected this new router, my life has become miserable. tons of problems and decreasing net speeds not letting me work from home. dont buy this junk product is a recommendation.",1
"The product reboots randomly and the WAN port though is down, the port status is till green.
This is one of the poorest customer support I have been in contact. Raise RMA in early October and it's been a month with no support.

What's surprising is TP-Link do not have an escalation matrix and the ticket has been updated with all misleading information about them reaching out to me, which has never happened.

Though the warranty is for 3 years. Without much support or response no point having even 100 years of warranty.",1
Faulty printer,1
DAMAGE PACKAGING AND FAULTY PRODUCT,1
Had to return because the product was damaged and had black ink marks,1
We received a defective product. But we were too late to identify that and Replacement window was closed. Seller cheated us. It gets rebooted every 4 hours and should manually turn it on. It's very irritating. Becareful before you purchase. Better go for Netgear routers.,1

"The phone heats up really bad during calls. The signal reception is really bad. The voice quality during calls is very bad, even if I put the phone on loudspeaker the voice is not clear even when there is proper signal. Mobile data does not work on my phone. I was using internet on this phone via wifi. now the phone has stopped connecting to wifi as well. the camera is really bad to the point that it is practically useless. I feel that this phone does not fulfill the basic requirements of a feature phone let alone a smartphone. This product is a total waste of money.",1
"I read the specs as 867 Megabits Per Second wifi download and purchased it in July. Now when I upgrade my ISP to a 500mbps speed, I got to know that it was just bogus info. The actual speed this one gives is just up to 100mbps.
Crap and totally disappointed with Amazon for selling this by incorrect description. I am now forced to purchase another router with no option to return the existing one.",1

"Pain Pain Pain in Ears!!! This Sony WH-CH710n is a pathetic over the ear Headphone.
Noise cancellation feature is so bad that it causes pain in both the ears if no sound is being played! :(
NC setting causes a continuous hissing sound if you wear it without anything being played :(
If there is No music played and unless you allow the Ambient setting you will immediately start feeling a lot of pain in the ear so unbearable that one cannot continue to wear this pathetic headphone.
Even after removing the headphones one continues to feel the pain and gives lot of headache!
Amazon - tech experts do not agree to the sounds caused by the settings and are just asking to continue using it! or asking to take it with Sony and not agreeing to return and replace with any other headphone without such issue!!
Beware Do not buy any electronic products from Amazon as they say return but they do not allow Returning the product.",1
The headphones broke after 3 days,1

"Absolute cheap product.. No warranty on these. All lies. The MI service centre manager at bangalore marathahalli says since I have not bought from him, he wld not take responsibility.. Xiaomi wht kind of unprofessional r u guys.. It stops working and though in warranty after 20 mins they say that techinal team has rejected. They found a dot less then a needle size on the case.

We filed and send email/complain, logged ticket but in response they just asked us to take survey and then they closed the ticket. where is the one year warranty you were talking about here?",1
Waste for money...,1
"Ptron is low cost product, seems to be valuable, but it normally works for 4-5 months only and then issues like no sound will arise. In Furtherance when customer support services which is only at Hyderabad, will be contacted they will keep on making false promises and never do replacement even in warranty period. Therefore better not to proceed for ptron products only looking at the cost. Better to pay some more amount and have peace in mind.",1

Instead Epson said that we have used nongenuine ink also printer not even used for more than 200 pages, more than 50% ink in the printer tank present but they have alleged that I have printed more than 7000 pages and they voided the warranty without resolving the issue... First they closed multiple cases without solving the problem, service center manager threatened that tell the truth else he will try maximum to void the warranty.",1

Poor set,1
Worst model in this brand with least accuracy and installation of app is extremely not user friendly. Ordered twice and returned this watch due to instrumental error in its readings.

Battery drain out quickly
Touch response is very bad
Less feature than the competitive models and brands.
More expensive than others brand and watch.
Bad sensor.
Bad application for watch.

Battery backup is very bad only battery backup of 2 days to 4 days.
The heart rate measurement is not that accurate and it's not very impressive you also feel very how to find out your accurate heart measurement on the app and on the watch
if you talk about the display displays very bad and the brightness is not that good and also I want like to mention the touch and the response is very very bad.
The glass is not that much durable and can get easily scratch on it
Again at this price you can buy another smartwatch better than this.
The application noise fitness is very bad it is I don't have any feature if you compare with MI band 5 and MI fitness app.
If you're listening to music and want to it doesn't show the name of the song.
You can't get notification from any app but in MI band you can get notification from any customise or downloaded app.
I am comparing this with MI band just because it is more expensive than MI band 5 but have less feature in less durability than MI band 5.
You can easily get notification from your Instagram and WhatsApp but when somebody is calling you and that time it is not that good and also tries to wake up option is not that responsive just because if you wear MI band and noise colorfit to then you will notice that in MI band response very quick and fast IN raise to wake up.",1
Not. Satisfied. With. Its. Performance...,1
"Evil Plan of Tp link...
C6 design has been refresh old C6 looked like C60 and its range and speed was far superior to C60.
hence New C6 looked like A9 at the same price range and there was a lot of debt which one was better their specification is totally the same.
the only difference in Old C6 was the range which was far superior to A9 but old C6 didn't have one mesh which was never required for avg home.

TP link's Evil plan.
They have reduced the range of C6 so much (don't forget the A9 range was already less) that you will lose 1/3rd of speed just in the next room from the router where my old router had enough speed range in the next room before.

Why did TP Link do That?
So that they can sell you One mesh device which is the almost the same price as a router per device and you have to get one for each room/corner of your house.",1
It keeps dropping signal every now and then. Even range is almost equal to a single antennae N150 routers. I returned it and bought a N150 of Dlink. Surprisingly that is working very well,1

It feels a bit uncomfortable after using it for about 2-3 hrs, but I got used to it.

Main problem is the durability, within month of using (I use it mainly for listening songs, about 2-3 hrs a day) left earphone output became quite low. Need to try my luck with warranty. But I won't recommend this product to anyone.",1

"The AX20 range (as per information on the internet, this holds true for the entire AX series for TP Link) has absolutely terrible 2.4GHz performance. The network is unusable at a distance of 3 feet without any obstructions. The network shows up fill strength, but devices can't connect. The connected devices will be unable to access the internet.
5GHz performance is reasonable - multiple devices, 4K streaming etc.

However, with the unusable 2.4GHz, all the smart home devices are rendered useless which basically means you need to get another router for them. This makes this router an absolute no buy.

Not recommended.",1

Warranty got over its not working ( not turning on) machine has turned into a piece of junk .. after warranty service is too bad, no troubleshooting steps over the phone for every single thing you need to take it to the service center....
Cartridges too costly
Installation easy but print yeild is very low.
Those who think that this printer's supplied cartridge will yeild around 50-60 pages(colour or black) are highly mistaken it didn't give me a yeild more than 10-15 pages (colour) & 20-25 pages(black) .
So if you think that this is going to give you a high yeild so you must give a second thought about it.
Wireless connectivity is easier but it goes worse if the button is pressed,creates problems in reconnecting with the wifi
I requested for replacement but Amazon team cancelled and it's returning to seller now I can't get a replacement I need to wait for the sale so as to get it's price dropped bcoz it's the second time it's price has increased from 3699 to 4499 now...",1

"The naming and the marketing of this router is misleading, they clearly state that the wifi band 2.4 ghz can support 300mbps and 5ghz support 800+mbps but the input port, in which the connection from your ISP supports maximum of 100mbs. The latter thing is no where mentioned in description and not even on the routers packaging. You will only find out that in the router configuration portal.

So if you have got a plan for 100mbps speed from your ISP, don't go for this router. Go for a higher model like Archer C6 gigabit.",1

"Having used Dell Ultrasharp 24 in, I ordered this one after reading great reviews on it. After trying all kinds of options for three days, it still tired my eyes in no time. In comparison, I can work on DELL U2415 Display for hours! I returned it after four days of wasted effort. May be people who have given highly positive reviews for programming as well have not used Dell U2415. The latter is pricey, but I am going to buy more of the same. Nothing beats 24-inch (1920 x 1200) in crispness, quality, and very low eye strain! The extra 200 pixels in width adds a lot to the comfort!

Can't comment on gaming capabilities.",1

Also i am facing the issue with the plug-in jack.Earlier it was fitting properly but now jack is loosely fitted in the phone.

Range Is About 15 - 20 Meters Only.
Coverage Upto 200 Meters In Description Means 200 Square Meters.

Description Was Written To Lure Customers.

Problem 2 :
No Facility Of MAC Filtering.
Which Kind Of Sucks For People Who Prefer An Extra Layer Of Security.

Problem 3 :
Doesn't Give Speed More Than 50 Mbps At Distance Of Just 1.5 Meters.
I have plan of 92 Mbps. & I hardly get speeds maximum upto 47 - 48 Mbps

Problem 4 :
Made In China
(So As Mi 3C Router Which Is Also Similar. ===> 80 Meters Range In Open Spaces Only)

Definitely Easy Setup

Other issue:
Makes lots of noice
Printing is not crisp, has shades
Slow printing

Demoed issues to Amazon support and asked if i can get replacement for other models and they said per policy they can replace with 6075 but not other models.
Any selling has to help customers and their satisfaction, but here even if customer is offering more money for better product, Amazon is not willing to exchange.

Honestly, get any printer which running cost is low and print quality is good and fast.",1

5) My old router was giving me 100+ speed on 5G. This crap is giving 60 to me. What a joke. INR 5k well wasted.

"Initially the printer worked fine. But issue started after 2 weeks, once the return period was over.

1. Issue related to paper handling. The printer was unable to pull paper properly from input tray, resulting in no printing and paper error. Seemingly the paper pulling roller was not able to make contact properly on the paper and hence not pulling it.
2. Then trying to print a test page from HP printer utility, it did not print. Tried multiple times, no luck. As per the printer utility program, if test page do not print, it means that the printer is malfunctioning!

Not expected from a new printer from reputed company like HP. Seems a loss of Rs. 7600/-.",1

"HP lost a court case but still persists in selling you these printers and cartridges with denial of your ownership over them. By misusing technology they discourage you from refilling and continuing to use the same ink cartridges for long. Their printers and cartridges are technologically designed to block such usage. You can't use them as if you owned them. It's as if you borrowed or leased or rented them from HP, with a pledge to suffer and feel frustrated for as long as the printer is with you.",1
The laptop is sooooo slow that it cannot do even basic operations. It takes 5-10 mins to start and takes another 10 mins to open microsoft word or excel.

We need to buy another one since this one is just a useless box. Amazon please help in getting support from Lenovo.,1

But after landline connection was restored, the problem with modem continued. We call the Bsnl technician to rectify the problem.

"Writing this review after 7 months of usage.

First of all THIS IS NOT GIGABIT ROUTER.
I was happy at first with this as i had 60mbps connection. And then i got 200Mbps connection in some offer. Then i got to know that even with 200 mbps connection from ISP i can't use it as my router doesn't support it.
The interface is 10/100. So this router will not support ISP with more than 100 Mbps speed.

The 1350 mbps has no practical use. Per port you get a maximum of 100 mbps so that's transfer speed of 10mbps. Whether its pc to pc or download speed.

The range for 5GHz is really really bad. I get average signal strength when the router is just 4 metres away with no walls in between.

Guys go for gigabit router. Future proof your investment. Good luck.",1

"The router has a major issue with WiFi. On the connected devices it frequently asks to sign-in to wifi. Once the ISP credentials are set on the router the wifi/internet connectivity on the devices should be seamless. However none of the devices connected over WiFi worked without facing the sign-in the issue. And the sign-in issues goes away after couple of restarts. And at times DHCP stops assigning the IPs. The devices get stuck at ""obtaining IP address"". This can only be solved either by a reboot or a hard reset.

I replaced the router and the new one also had the same issue. Even though i had this router for only two days, I was frustrated to the core with the constant restarts I need to perform on both the router and the devices to get this working. I have returned the replacement and went back to using my old TPLink router which works like a charm.

I guess the latest firmware has a bug or the recent batch has a hardware defect. I tried all possible solutions ( changing the Channel width, running only on one of the band, reserving static IP for the devices, adjusting DHCP lease time) and none fixed the issue. Strictly speaking there shouldn't be any scope for troubleshooting. Setting up of a router should be effortless, not frustrating like this.",1

7. Decent quality of plastic used for case cover

On the positive side - it looks great, thats it.

It is not using full bandwidth as per my broadband plan. I thought it might be a cable/ISP issue. During this COVID conditions I preferred to go better speed as I see more bandwidth requirement. So I have chosen 150Mbps plan. But speed never touched beyond 80/90Mbps. After continuous followups with ISP, technician visited and resolved a cable issue and get full speed if ISP cable connected directly. But surprisingly router speed not changed. It is still below 100Mbps and tried all possible options. But no luck. I suspect something wrong with router. So requested technician to test with another router. He tested with D-Link 825 router, then speed got boosted up and saw full bandwidth. I researched internet and found C60 AC 1350 offers maximum speed up-to 100Mbps. I was very disappointed and frustrated. Did lot of research even buying this and bought this featured router. I am not that much knowledgeable on network terminology. After reading lot of reviews finally bought this for future needs also. Post this issue, I read some articles and understood that I was deceived. It is very hard to understand technical crux. Website description will made us fools. I will also take blame on me. I would have spend more time and do some deep research before buying. However, I would like to advice just don't go by website descriptions and top reviews. It is our responsibility and take some expert help before buying network related items.",1

I don't know why,maybe I am from a small town or what, but Amazon and Appario retail decided to send me version 1.0 which is an older version.
The newer improved version still v2.0 and 1.2 are similar it is said.

"Update 16 Oct 20
Samsung service is trying to push manufacturing defects as my fault. They are playing with small users. Please be careful buying any Samsung product as they are operating like a fly-by-night company.

I've already spent Rs. 3,000 for a Rs. 6,000 phone without a working phone for the last 1 month.

Update on 29 Sep 20.
Reducing status to 1 star.
The phone is increasingly giving problems.
a) The screen responsiveness is getting worse.
b) The SD card is always giving error.
c) Taking lots of time to load Apps.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I exchanged my Samsung On5 for Samsung M01 Core mainly because of the lack of internal memory. Good sturdy experience of On5 let me to buy this phone. I have no complaints about the hardware though many of the software have regressed from On5. Let me write them down:

1. Samsung On5 running on Android 6 was more stable than current Android 10. It has rebooted atleast twice on it's own.
2. Camera has no panorama and other mode which was there in On5.
3. Chrome hanged twice during this period.
4. SD card stopped reading once. Had to push it back again to work. Never happened in On5.
5. Do Not Disturb can't be customized. Samsung On5 had it.
6. Unread SMS not highlighted.

Go version shouldn't mean regression. I'll be happy to discuss with the architects who would want genuine op",1

Highly disappointed. What's the point of going for a flash sale if the quality standards are not met.,1
Problem of accuracy and returning problem also,1
The accuracy is way off. Please do not buy this product as you won't be able to return it because of the horrible return policy.,1

It worked smoothly for 4-5 months. No ear pain during long usage but left side stopped working suddenly about 5th month from purchase. It comes with no warranty so can't do anything. Either order new one or listen from right side only. seems manufacturing defect to me.,1
"I BOUGHT IT LAST YEAR AND IT STOPPED WORKING ON ONE SIDE 2 MONTHS AGO, SINCE THEN I'M TRING TO CLAIM WARRANTY BUT I COULDN'T CLAIM WARRANTY. I EVEN TRIED TO CONTACT AMAZON CUSTOMER CARE BUT NOTHING HAS CHANGED. KINDLY MAKE THE NEEDFUL",1

The subwoofer is very much poor quality.,1
Very worst product. It can harm your phone for sure.Please don't try to buy this product even don't think.,1
I am getting the expected speeds as this router gives me 200Mbps on 5Ghz but can never cross 90Mbps on 2.4Ghz. Main problem is its range. The 5Ghz band signal drops significantly even in the same room and totally disappears when you go to another. It practically makes the 5G totally unusable. I have a dual band Netgear router as well. It's 5Ghz drops too but I can still access it from other rooms and has full signal in the same room. I am wondering if this product I received is defective or not. Do not see a return option only replacement. Would have loved to return this and buy another,1

"1. Purchase date:- 14-05-2020 with one year warranty
Warranty expiry date of camera I checked from canon wedsite:- 10-12-2021
The date and month should be same, That means warranty starts 6 months before the purchase date with two year warranty.
2. The camera package seal was broken. both camera and lense was simply put in the box without any cover.
3. Camera strap was missing.
I returned the item for replacement.

Here I am attaching the screenshots from the video I took while unpacking.",1

On installation of printer and software. A test page and alignment page printed. Checked estimates ink level in cartridge in the HO software. It showed 2/3rd level in colour and nearly 1/2 level in black. Either cartridges were faulty or with low ink level. Black cartridge printed no more than 50 pages. Most expensive per page printing cost at around Rs 15 per page.,1
The camera's glass came out withing 5 months on its own. Never buy such products,1
"Its so worse that when product performance is not good there is NO OPTION TO RETURN. I couldn't even place return order on the day it got delivered. The reason given is so stupid: ""It contains battery, so can't be returned"". Come on, expected something better atleast. Worst ever experience to me after using Amazon for 5 years.
Please think twice before ordering anything valuable on Amazon. This would be my last order",1

Only good thing is step count & battery life. Good enough for a Rs. 500 to 1000 wearable. A high-priced Fitbit is a better bet in terms of accuracy & reliability, though it has a poor battery & overall service life of around 2 years only.",1

This has to be the WORST printer I have ever used. It's real name should be paper jam. It does not print more than 5 pages in a row and the whole thing jams and sticks. Have had it for about 3 months and the experience has been a nightmare. I spend more time ordering paper than anything else. I had thought making such an investment will support my work but instead I am not stuck with a really expensive printer that jams and sticks and DOES NOT PRINT in peace!! I should have gone with my gut and bought HP.,1

I got a defective product. The phone is only one month old but fails to connect to the network. When i took it to the service centre they are telling that the phone is previously opened and looks like a refurbished one. So they wont give the warranty. So planning to go legally now.,1

The product was torn outside. I must say sound quality and all the other features are good. But the product I recieved is slightly damaged and now I am not able to replace. There is only a return option.,1
"Sound quality is very bad. FM is not working.
Broken remote delivered.",1
The printer continues to give issues regarding paper input. The paper goes in a bit tilted. Not worth buying at any price. I exchanged the product but still facing the same issue.,1

"I bought this on July 2019 for 500₹ I used it quite normally not so rough not so much care.

It worked for like 6 months.",1
"the buds are very uncomfortable and big, the return period is 7 days only which I didn't notice, i would not recommend this product better purchase a little higher price or different model.",1
The mobile phone is good. But it is a very small one. We cannot use it for hardly 30 mins. It is getting hot. Very slow charging. This phone is only for our parents and grandparents because they do not use so much as we do,1
Actually there is nothing in the product that can be appreciated..The product is promoted on the basis of quality of extra bass which is totally a fake promotion. There is no bass..and the sound quality is also very disappointed..Overall the quality of the product is very cheap and below average....An earphone of costing Rs 50 has much better quality than this product....Its my humble request to you please stop cheating customers through these fake advertisement and promotions......,1
Don't buy this piece of crap... The battery charger doesn't fit and neither it works... I thought mi will come up with better product but it is pure disappointment. I don't know what kind of factory inspection they do.. No quality at all,1
I faced issues with music player. Except Google Music others not supporting. Synchronize issue found after using some days. The incoming calls not shows if synchronize not done !,1
इस फोन की बैटरी थोड़ा सही है बट इसके कैमरे तो बहुत ही बेकार है और इस फोन को मात्र दो महीने हुआ और हैंग करने में फास्ट है और हीट तो बहुत तेजी से हो रहा है इसलिए इस फोन को भुल कर भी नहीं ले,1

It’s accuracy is very poor. Not at all recommended for anybody. I bought it thinking it would help me in tracking my running and steps but it’s accuracy is pathetic. Everyday I run for 3 km but this band is showing me only 1.7-1.8 km. I’m very disappointed with this product.,1

It is calculating hand movements as steps.,1
Don't Buy this. Why I am saying this because the head band is very tight and it causes pain in ear after just 10-15 mins of usage and believe me this sole factor is enough to not to buy this you will not be able to enjoy the music no matter the sound quality. And worst of all you cannot even return it only replace it which is very bad as a consumer.,1
"I received this order in replacement for other.
Actually I ordered different router, but I received different one. Even giving it for replacement still I received same router. I inform to cs team of Amazon through mail. I sent them both photos of router of which ordered I placed and ordered I received. I also sent them two different links of these two different product. Still they they are replying that they are not able to see any difference between this two products. Also mail them twice with all details. Still they are not able to differentiate between this two. I am totally disappointed. Also there is around 250+rs cost difference between these two. I think I need to take this to consumer forensics court.",1

I experienced same issue faced by many other reviewers. It just won't print color no matter what settings or devices you try. Total waste and I am returning this. Do not watse your time and money on this useless product. Never expected this from a reputed brand like HP.,1
Major concern is longevity of battery. The life of this device is less than a year and battery life starts reducing day by day from 8 days to few hours. The product is not economic. Life of this product stands about one year.,1

Hi I had purchased ur product BT while I was installing the installation CD was empty please send me the CD asap or send me the installation set up,1
"I have purchased this last month and after using it one month I can surely tell you that it's a waste of money. Find out why below:

1. Touch controls to raise volume, pause next or previous song --> Not smooth, you need to repeatedly do it.
2. Sound quality --> It's just okay for music and videos. But when it comes to calling, you might be able to hear the voice of the other person. BUT your voice will not be clear to the other person.
3. Connectivity --> As soon as you move away from your phone, only 2-3 feet (WITHOUT ANY WALLS in between) then also voice distortion starts. so not so truly wireless when you have voice distortion when moving away from your phone.

One line for review --> Don't waste your money here. If your budget can't go above 2k then go with wired earphones and if you can go above 2k go for other brands.",1

First of all the packaging is very bad, the headphone was opened and unsealed. Secondly talking about sound, worst experience ever. Bass is terrible it hurts my ears when I keep it around full volume.
It claims that bluetooth will work for 8 hours but it doesn't. The low quality got the headset so hot while charging, it smells like burning or exploding. I'm worried, it's really NOT safe to use. Very disappointed with the purchase.",1

"Recently bought the TP Link Archer C6(US) Hardware version 3.2. This router is good when you consider the speed alone. Wifi devices configured in this router loose the internet connection at random time, and to regain the internet you have to restart the router. Interesting thing is that your device 1 may be working fine with internet connectivity but at the same time device2 shows no internet. This is discussed extensively in the TP Link forum in this header ""Archer c6 ""no internet access"" and sometime not connecting to the wifi saying ""limited connection"". Seems to be a firmware issue, but loosing the internet connection in middle of an office call is not a good choice (with the fact that the internet connection is still present but the router just denied it for some of the wifi clients)",1

I have brought this printer in June. Difficult to configure and you don't have proper manual to configure with box packing. Manufacturer claims it can print 4500 in B&W and 7500 in colour is a false claim. Your printer cartridge would be over in less than 1000 pages for both colour and B&W.

"So my plan is of 60 mbps (ethernet gives me those speeds) but I barely get 5-10 mbps. This might be a defective peice. Amazon's 10 replacement policy was over by the time I noticed, customer service is useless so I'm stuck with this non functional router.

Range is marginally better than TP link but the speed reduction and latency is very high. Pings in online games shoot up to 160-200 ms in Indian servers while ethernet gives me 30-60 ms.

I truly wasted my money on this. Never buying Tenda again. YouTube defaults to 240p and most sites take so long to load. I now use mobile data on my phone and try to use ethernet as much as possible in my laptop. What a worthless router.",1

It is unbelievably low quality. The sound is pathetic. Worse than 50 rupees roadside head phones. The bass is negligible. I got fooled by ratings on the site and it seems amazon is not transparent and fudge the ratings. There can be no other reason for such bad product getting so many good ratings.

If you are going to buy this product buy at your own risk because at first it will be treat you good but after you buy this you will end up losing a good amount of money from your pocket.,1

it's not worth... bass is not good. overall product is not good,1
Battery backups issues.,1
Can't access the value because no one from Amazon or HP has contacted for installation. Very poor service. A company person came and dumped it at office. No knowledge hot to connect because it's a technical product. It is not a child's play. Also while ordering extended warranty option was missing now it is reflecting.

I connected with MacBook Pro but the music coming out from this product was very average, u will not feel quality.

Media prioritization is a joke. Frequent WiFi disconnections that happens 50 times a day. The only fix is turning WiFi off and on. MU-MIMO is also a joke. Don't waste your money on this crap router that fails to provide a stable WiFi network even when sitting next to it. Utterly disappointed by the performance of this router. My old R7000 still works much better than this crap.,1

Beyond that range the signal is very very week. Even when I connect 2 phones and 2 laptops the modem couldn't handle that and the entire signal is jammed. And my firestick connectivity to this modem is very bad and it asks to connect every time I turn on my firestick!!. I am too fed up with this and disconnected this modem and connected my old modem back and it works just fine!!. Will not buy this again and definitely do not recommend this modem to anyone.,1

1-Flash Makes too much noise
2-You cannot record a good quality of sound because it does not support any external mice.
3-This camera does not support any audio jack for recording sound.
4-Wifi does not control the video recording function
5-No Bluetooth connection could be established with other devices.
6-This camera is manufactured recently, but it does not have recent audio jack.
7-They are using very old audio jack technology. If the external audio jack is compatible, then canon should give the one connectin cable and audio jack which complies with the camera, but unfortunately, the camera does not provide it.

Thus it is concluded it is an outdated product is dumped in the Indian market through Amazon platform.
if canon disprove me, I will remove this product review or update it",1

So, I am asking u that what is the solution for this to me . Y wasting my money for this",1
Pathetic in the very beginning... Cannot be installed as the windows can't detect the printer. Canon customer care is useless. No support on call. Gave number of a local repair agency which is not recwiving the call. Waste of money and time.,1

"Like any other Indian buyer, I was swayed away by following
- Cost ( Cheaper than its competitors )
- Looks ( 4 Antennas give a impression that its super strong)
- Product Reviews ( 6000 reviews, mostly 5 or 4 star)

Reality:
Looks are deceptive - These 4 antenna are just for show-off, I think there’s only one internal antenna that really works. Even if you remove other 3 antennas the signal strength remains the same.

Usefull - Naah.. my problem still remains, this Router is no better then D-Link 600 that I had earlier. Not a single bit improvement in the Wifi signal that I use to get in my house with D-Link.

Cost - I think people should not fell for Cost, a slightly costly one from Netgear is far superior than this toy. I borrowed a netgear router from my friend it worked like a charm and gave me far superior performance. I’m selling it on Olx, and will get a Netgear now.

Ratings: I think these user reviews are biased and manipulated within legal framework. As these are not audited by any 3rd party company. If you need to buy any product from amazon, then please check review and ratings of the product outside on other 3rd party websites. It will help.
Happy to answer any question if you guys may have.",1

"I've been using TP-Link Routers at home and work for quite some time now, however since I upgraded my net speed to 100mbps I had to get one these so-called Giga Routers. Like in the past I assumed this would also be a Set-up and forget about it like all the others before it.
Once the set up was done I could log-on to the net for exactly 2 mins before the Router would REBOOT! Thought it might have been a 1-time anomaly or might have been something wrong with the connection.
Got the connection check, replaced it one of my old TP-Link Routers and it was working fine.
I wasn't getting the Full Range and Bandwith I was getting with the Giga router but at least it was rebooting involuntarily every few minutes.
After checking everything else I concluded that there was an issue with the router I received.
I checked Online and turns out some of the other users of this same C1200 model were facing the same issues as well. None of them could find a solution.

I have returned this Router ... It might have been one of those 1 in 100 defective piece or there might some an issue with this model an not sure which. However, I would recommend anyone buying this model to check for this issue on the day they receive the package.

Please Note I have reordered another model of TP-Link Router and am hoping that doesn't have the same issue.",1

The monitor itself was good and I will buy this one properly at a local store, albeit at a higher price. I lost my trust on Amazon after 5 years. Will update the review again in the future if any changes are made

Edit 1: They took the monitor back and offered a refund but they didnt do a replacement like I asked. Immediately after I returned it, the deal was again active with a single piece! It seems they resold the used monitor they sent to me as new again to someone else!!",1

"I ignored the negative reviews, especially those about receiving phones that would not turn on. I paid the price for it. I received a phone that never turned on- defective. But, then the worst part was yet to come. The wait for an inspection. Then, the worst bit about waiting a few weeks for amazon to pick the package back. I understand that amazon did its best in these circumstances in the COVID scenario. I would strongly suggest that this model could be best avoided. Samsung should seriously consider withdrawing models such as these which are a shame.",1

To my horror, I found on the official TP Link forums that almost all are facing same problem with this model, and the best solution form TP Link was to put a fan blowing on to the router and switch off WiFi, which is an absurd solution considering people buy this for WiFi.

Dont buy this product from Appario Retail Private Ltd as they are fraud . The heading claim that it will provide speed upto 867 Mbps / 5 Ghz which is just wrong.

Firstly, the box was damaged. Secondly, only one earpiece was functional and the second one was not working.

I requested for an exchange and the replacement was never delivered. Instead an Amazon associate came upto my house and collected the product I had. And after 10 days of chatting with customer service. I got my refund

Issue being pentium gold is a weak processor and only good for battery saving.

If you think of anything else like gaming or development using IDE please buy an 8th gen core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 3200u or above laptop.
BTW ryzen 3 laptops are cheaper and perform as good and have better integrated graphics.(so save money and put that in more RAM and ssd)

Also it has only single RAM slot, so you would never be able to run it on dual channel memory .
Please remember dual channel ram + ssd is the key to smooth performance.
Ssd alone will only make startup and shutdown fast but applications benefits from more memory bandwidth.",1

"I had used 2 Xiaomi phone and they were really good, hence I decided to buy mi band, but my decision was completely wrong.
Data accuracy is really bad, you sitting idle, and will check after some time steps count is increased.
I counted the steps while walking 3 times, there was big difference between my number and of band.
Band dose not auto detect the activity, you have to select it each time, and if you missed to stop, it will continue to add data without even realizing you have actually stopped.
I runned on treadmill for 20 mins for 3 km, but band was showing just 700 meters.
The worst part is, it show to stay fit one should walk 8000 steps in a day, I selected 10,000 steps.
I spend 2 hrs doing workout, running, cycling, weight lifting, exercising in gym, but still I have to walk to achieve my target of 10,000 steps. that's rubbish.
even the gesture functions are not working properly. 1 out of 10 times, display actually lights up to show the time and date when you raise arm.
only Pros is sleep monitoring, which is good but only if you are sleeping properly on bed. if you are taking a power nap on chair or sofa, it will not be counted.
I am now using it just as a watch.
Probably one of the worst product of Xiaomi, don't go for it. try fitbit or any other brand who are expert in fitness band category.",1

"Within 2 days of purchase, the product started to drop the internet connection very frequently. And 20 days later it even stopped to establish the ADSL link. Suspecting the Internet Connection provided by my ISP, I took the product along with my 8 years old Huawe modem (which is a non wireless one). My old Huawe modem was able to establish the ADSL LINK permanently but the D-Link DSL-2750U Wireless N 300 is not establishing the ADSK LINK. MY ISP informed me the D-Link DSL-2750U Wireless N 300 is weak (what a 20 days old modem getting weak!!!) And I called the D-Link helpline # and they raised a case and advised me to take the modem to their service centre at Annasalai,Chennai and the product is till being investigated by the experts.

I mainly preferred online purchase for best price deal and I need not travel to the shop and get the product. But now, I went to the service centre to give the product, they told they will take 2 days for investigation and later gimme a call to come and receive the product. So my ultimate goal of not travelling to purchase the product in store is waste now, as I need to again travel 30 Kms in Chennai to get back the product from service center + really headache because of the faulty product.

I am really unhappy with the product and may think twice before I purchase any such electronic product from online store and this is my first purchase with Amazon India. Amazon delivered the product on time and in good manner. But it is the product with which I am unhappy.",1

Daily it restarts 5-6 times without anything and it creates problems in my daily meetings/work, childs daily school due to disconnection issues. Luckily I had my old router so my work and other things are not disturbed else due to this replacement policy it would have impacted me a lot.

"I’d have given negative ratings if possible. One side stopped working within 2 months.
Regarding replacement within warranty, JBL will ask you to visit nearest collection center. If you’re in Mumbai, things will be even bad for you as there are very limited service centers and considering the current situation its difficult to visit their.
Neither JBL, nor Amazon will understand this and you’ll end up keeping the defective product anyway hoping the lockdown eases soon.",1

This is worst product from Xiaomi,2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 There is a lot of hanging and the warranty of 1 year is still not fulfilled.",2
"This prints 20 to 30 pages only (incl.black and color print outs).
The main drawback is once the original ink is over that's it..its a waste..either.You have to buy Hp black and hp color inks(price is higher than the printers price) or buy local brand inks and get an average colored print outs.
My opinion is to better buy good printers which is more than rs.10,000/- so that the cartridges refilling costs you less and also you can take good qty and qlty color prints.",2
Its just a working mobile in which everything but nothing is good,2
I dont think its original...last time i ordered black one...and tht was pretty good...this its jst a replica...not good at all...didnt expct this frm amazon,2

"I have used JBL products before and this is the first time I am disappointed. The earphones don't have an issue with sound quality but are very uncomfortable to wear beyond 30 minutes. I even tried changing the earphone buds (different sizes provided), but got no relief from the change. The Samsung earphones, though much cheaper, were more comfortable to use for longer duration.",2
This camera auto focus very bad and picture quality bad and this camera battery backup so bad,2
Not good for music and calling,2

"No Automatic Audio Recording
Hang Problem
Screen Layout Change automatic many times",2
"Bought this product to serve the purpose of less hassle with wires and better neck movement while playing. The latency in sound is annoying and doesn't support mobile gaming.
Sound quality isn't market standard. Doesn't live upto the hype. Pretty average for a brand that promises too much.",2
"Sound quality is fine
Battery life is good
But the thing is about its built quality
Ik at this price range getting ANC is reasoble but the noice cancellation is not good
Doest deserve this price",2
It started with few hours of backup but after 4 months of usage it reduced to 20 seconds...,2

Service boys is not good. Misbehave Person.,2

I was booked this and had been delivered to me. Unfortunately the left side eartip was not working. I replaced the order. Than i got new one it is nice both earth's are working. Good sound quality.,2
The accuracy is not that great.,2
"I ordered Grey colour Noise color pro fit 2, Wore it for 4 days and I started noticing that the color of belt started changing something like this for god knows what reason..Need a replacement.",2
I had purchased these earphones 2 months ago after 1.5 month the one side stopped working properly and now the whole set has stopped working . What's the purpose of buying a company product like boat when it is also has to behave like a local cheap product. Kindly exchange this product soon.,2
"Many time...the other person cannot hear our voice through headphones....many times v r not able to hear there voice...so needs to reconnect ...
it shws disconnected even if its connected...",2
"Very average sound i will test these for few days and will see if i am comfortable or not. If not i will order another wired earphones. I have tried several things with these earphones like sound quality , calls, different genre of music it doesn't really pass all the tests ofcourse and you shouldn't really expect much at this price. For those who want to just have wireless earphones temporarily go for it or else choose wired ones they're much better due to being connected to cellphone.",2
"All other features are okayish if not good. But I had to return it since after using a couple of times i realized i cannot recieve a call as the mic is terrible. I used MI earphones (basic one) before this for more than one year and never had any issue. I don't know about the higher ranges, but within this price range MI is definitely better than JBL.",2
"Hi Team,

Product: Am facing heating compliant and performance and camera quality is very bad.

Reg Amazon : I tried to return the product but they were not ready to take the product back even it's not working
and amazon customer care disabled the return and call option without completion of the return date mentioned before ordered the product...

i suggest everyone before ordering any product please check with customer care about the return policy and keep the evidence with you, because amazon people not maintaining company standards to return the product",2
"Respected sir
In paking box no installation CD and fax concting cable nill.
Only printer,power cable ,usb cable and cartage 2 .... please reply r return the product... please immediately.",2
This product has improved compared to earlier bands however PAI tracking incorrect. Everything needs to be selected while activity . Manual intervention should be reduced to improve device.,2
"Camera quality very poor.
Battery charging slow",2
DOES NOT HAVE GOOD RANGE,2
"I had an excellent time using Mi Band 3 so skipped a generation and went for Band 5. They've improved in almost all aspects except battery life and the front glass durability.

My Mi Band 3 lasts nearly a month or more on full charge(when not using BT) whereas this drops to 85% battery in just 3 days.

Been using the Mi Band 3 roughly for nearly 2+ years now, without a screen protector and it barely has a scratch on it till now. I took Band 5 outside for a run and by the time I came back, it already had nearly 3 clearly visible scratches on the front. Not durable at all, Xiaomi should either provide a screen protector or use durable glass like the one in Band 3 for their next product.

Functionality wise, I tried the Indoor Cycling workout and it was highly inaccurate. Apparently, I burned 750 calories in the span of 30 minutes (which is completely inaccurate). Step tracking is somewhat accurate though.",2
"The step count is absolutely useless. As can be seen from the attached screenshot, after walking 10.12 KMs my MI tracker is showing a step count of only 9513 when it should not be less than 12500. The GPS and accelerometer are not in sync.",2
Though printer is gud but it consume too much ink and i got defective cartridge where new black cartridge for Rs. 900. Here the cost of printer is low but the cost of cartridge both black and colour is more then the cost if printer. Not worth of money. Think twice before purchasing this product.,2
Have been using these headphones daily for almost a month and the quality is poor. The volume in the right earpiece has already been defected and you can hardly hear anything that too in less that a months usage. The wires get tangled all the time and not of good quality. I am really disappointed with the quality of earphones from JBL.,2
It's range is very short it can't cover my house even my bed,2
First 2 weeks band was working fine but not heart rate function stopped working when I woke up. I'll not gonna buy this again,2
"These are the main problems i faced and ones that needed to be considered:
1)Pain on ears,the headphones are much smallar than excepted resulting in pain in the ear due to use over time.
2)Too much bass to the point it destroys the music quality.The extra bass is too much that it feels artificial and not natural to music flow.
Good points:
1)Portable and well made",2
Initially it was two good...but after 4 months only one ear side was functional which was very disappointing..still trying to get it changed in service center.,2
"It's only work 2 months now it's stop working within 2 months

Not expect.",2
It's very slow and hangs a lot.,2
"What benefit we will get if I have 6gb or 8gb ram. How come this mobile will not provide dual band wifi, means I am getting low Internet speed with that single band wifi feature. Very much disappointed with this big drawback. Even lower price mobiles are giving this feature but not m12. Samsung smartly avoided by not mentioning this in the product description.",2
"Poor workmanship.The wire connecting the switches just came out while putting the charging port.Worse than local product.Not at all sturdy.After two weeks the headphone stopped switching on. When it is getting charged light is on but when you remove the power and try switching on.It does not work.PTron customer support is worse. They are giving flimsy grounds for not supporting.

SUGGESTION:Don't buy this product",2
Thing is gud..sound quality bass those things are well but ear is paining sometimes evey headphones have those problem value worth u are not gonna get something like this ever overall perfect one,2
"Only battery life is gud
Despite gud ram this phone is slow n gets switch off wen multiple apps are open
It's just been 1 month of use n this phone sucks",2
The product is not as per specifications connectivity is no good beyond 15 feet. the price is not justified for the product.As specified penetration through wall is not there.,2
Poorly designed earphones. Keeps falling off.,2
Hanging peace,2
"Not Good at all. This is Idiot watch. It is not Fake but It cannot measure my Heart Rate and Sleep Track at all. I slept for about 9 hours but it showed 4 1/2 Hours... Also when I was sitting And watching Twitch, I just did a test and tested my Heart Rate. For a minute it showed my 62 and then 136...Don’t buy this.. You may be thinking that this will be returned...NO..It doesn’t even Return..Do not buy",2
"First 15days working properly but after that touchscreen not working, hang time to time,also I got invoice of in cut size not mentioned proper order on it,",2
Purchased almost 8 months back. Initially do not supporting bsnl broadband. We have to reset it almost daily and update password. So we had update it from service guy then from last 2 months its Working normally. But suggestion from bsnl that do not go for d-link for their broadband.,2
Black ink cartridge is empty for 25 prints only,2
"Pros:The only good thing about the product is its price..its a good deal under 1000 bucks..
Cons: its look really dull and dirty after few days..very hard to clean it even with a cloth
Despite of having 2 antennas the reach of wifi connectivity is quite poor..u hv to come really close to the router if u actually want to browse or download something",2
Very slow speed I have ever experienced,2
"Randomly stops, some people say its due to heating not sure, but all the lights would light up and it would just hang and nothing will connect to it until restarted",2
Battery backup is not good..,2
The battery got discharged within 48 hours when I recharged it the second time. Where can it be serviced.,2
"The only thing that boat does is providing cheap yet premium looking products. But these lack the basic thing:
1. Too loud; if a person uses it for prolonged period they will feel pain in their ears.
2. The grip : these are too hard on the ears and cause sweating and pain.
3. Only good for bass.
4. sound leaks a lot.
5. Not a good option
6. Should opt for earphones rather than these premium looking budget friendly options.",2
Easy to install and work well but range is not so good. You can buy it for a small home and office.,2
"The product is good but it stopped working in just a month. I visited the support site, registered my product before complaint but they didn't even respond. Its been a week since i requested for the registration. Bad service.",2
Step counting is very inaccurate. Very disappointed,2
"Good monitor but only draw back is if u want connect this monitor from DP to Hdmi it is too hard get a good connector and if you got one picture quality is bad
So check ur cpu or leptop before u order.",2
"NO, doubt about the best fitness band available under 3k in India is Mi band 4.
I love the band especially the AMOLED screen, watch faces. A bit disappointed with the quality of the strap. The same was observed when I bought Mi band HRX, band 3 also. Replacing the band every time when bought on the first sale. Band 4 was used for around 4-5 days.",2

 This device is utter Garbage, I have bought this watch the day it was released on Amazon,

Just after 2 days of using it,
I realized the wrist awake feature is worthless, does not sense proper movement,

Then the Spo2 monitor is also highly inaccurate, it is supposed to have COUNTINIIUS tracking but in reality it hardly even does, the entire day the stress meter did not record anything,

Now connectivity issue, every 15-20 min the watch will get disconnected from my phone's Bluetooth for some unknown reason (I literally have no idea why) i have tried all troubleshooting steps and nothing has worked,

The watch faces - this watch has literally 20 wallpaper and you gotta select only from that, then there's cloud based wallpaper, which is just cleaver marketing technique it will store only one wallpaper that too with out any change of theme or any kind of customization.

4k is the price i paid and i repent it deeply.

Do not
I repeat DO NOT buy this watch",2
Not smooth,2
"It is not able to update system and security patch,",2
One ear plug lost sound within 6 months.,2
Remote not working. What can I do,2
"After use of 4-5 days suddenly it is showing absurd figures of steps , heartbeat and temperature. Even while sitting it was showing increase in steps and while walking it was skipping steps by 10-50-100 and showing increased numbers .",2

"Bit slow, I'm not satisfied with this product",2
"I purchased this hoping better range than the free Beetle modem provided by Airtel. I did not see much enhancement of range, free modem did more or less the same job. I am not complaining that the modem is bad but I dont see a point what makes it better than the free modem given by Airtel, was my penny spent well, absolutely no.",2
The range of wifi signal is weak. It's not covering a normal 2 BHK flat even,2
"I am using an older TP-link router for more than 5 years. Its 150 Mbps and the network is stable. It has the Old Classic UI.

This A6 Router is simple to configure if you are not using advance configuration (ARP binding, MAC filtering, IP Address Reservation, DHCP from other Router ).

In case you are planning to configure the above. I do not recommend this router.

Regarding stability. It freezes frequently and you will need to restart it manually.

Detailed Rating as below:

Basic Configuration 10/10
Advance Configuration 5/10
Stability 5/10
Range 7/10
Build Quality 6/10
Heating problem - Observed
Features 7/10",2
"It works great if there is no walls! But if u have 1 wall 5 GHz! Signal strength will reduce to 50%⬇️ and 2.5ghz! To 75% ⬇️

If it is near to router without anywall! 5ghz is a charm! ❤️
BETTER PURCHASE D-LINK! it's great! Comparatively",2

cannot login using multiple device. logs out other device,2
"I like everything in this printer but the real reason is about disliking this product is not imtge printer but it's cartage system it's very much costly you could even buy a new printer if you wish to buy two three sets of new cartage don't buy this printer if you wish to print economically don't take this printer even you if you want to print 1 or 2 prints because that will even cost you more than 10 or 11 rupees per print so don't buy by another type of printer which do not use cartridge system if you want to print economically

"Have been patronising mi products for a while but had a very bad experience with last two purchases. 3C was better in signal dispensing with decent range. This was placed in same position but it fails to share signal 12 feet away from the router. Earlier modllel used to give signal above 20 feet. Sorry, not value for money",2

"Not a reliable product. Boat's Hawk version is way better than this JBL.
This earphones worked only up till 3 months. Then one of the earphone just stopped working...",2
"This product is just not worth the amount of money spent
1. No Basic screen guard is provided, so you actually cant use the watch until you get screen cover for the same which is harder to get incurrent situations
2. The Noise App keeps on sending bulky notifications of their products which is very annoying, looks like a free product which is sending the ads to you
3. the Noise app uses a lot of battery and network data of your devices, without any usage on my device, still my daily network data was consumed at least around 500 MB.",2

"Update : after 8 months the headphone broke ,has bluetooth issue . Build quality is really bad .Good headset in this price range , look's better than 400 &510 series,
Bass is average
Battery backup -7-8hrs
Provided aux cable is of low quality.
Overall build quality is only average.

Got this under 1k with offers from Amazon pay",2
not good phone hang any time,2
,2
It is not value worthy ... !! Not happy with the product accuracy. Would like to see more features in it .,2
"Pros:
1. Mic is located at perfect spot. So no need to hold it up. Finally somebody used brain while manufacturing earphone.
2. 1 yr warranty
3. Noise cancellation on papers
Cons:
1. Bass is not good. Sound quality is just ok. Much cheaper Oppo and Vivo earphones give better sound quality.
2. I don't think noise cancellation is working perfectly.

Overall it's ok but expected more from JBL esp when you're going for this budget on earphones.
Update:
Mic gave up in 5 months. Speaker quality is ordinary. Not happy about buying this product for this price.",2

 First worst experience with amazon while purchasing mobile. There is a small creamish spot inside the screen, could be manufacturing defect or could be the result of improper handling.

It's OK for listening music but calling poor performance of microphone and voice hearing from it while in call is poor quality.,2
"Please don't buy this product if you use it on a daily basis.... One month of using it daily the ear plugs are almost spoilt - the sound volume gas gone so low, the small black speaker is just a sticker that keeps coming out... The logo is almost erased.",2
The charger of watch stopped working in 2 months...Ridiculus,2
Range is very poor and signal keeps continously going . Would like to return this product,2
"It is not worth for Balcony as it's range is very short, the faces of a person moving on the street is not recognizable.
, actually I could install today in my balcony, but found it is not worth , if possible I want this to be returned and will buy another one of longer range.",2
Wan Speed Not above 100 Mbps Or Lan switch speed is Also not above 100 Mbps,2
Consumes hours to reconnect daily morning or whenever the phone gets switched off or gets disconnected,2
"I went for this printer for home, expecting to have low cost printer fitting the purpose. The promise from HP is 120 pages for black and white cartridges. But it drained within 50 pages. That makes the cost per page of print to INR 10, which is high cost print. This is not economically viable.",2

Nothing much.not sound cacellation .mic muh pe rakh ke baat karni padti h.not so powerfull .price kafi high h,2
Not to my satisfaction. My purpose of purchase- heart rate monitoring while exercising. Not accurate and not usable while running or active physically.,2
No situation,2
"Just a typical printer scanner. Nothing excited about this product, just a with basic features.And the cartridge comes with the printer are just to make customer fool. Only 25% are filled.",2
"I bought it and was so very happy with the look until I heard a static sound in the background of my zoom meeting which hurt my head so much. So I tested it with some songs and I heard the static sound but it was much lower with the songs. I tested this case again with my old headphone (which doesn't have cushion in the surface, it got torn) and the sound was perfect, no static sound or whatsoever. I'm glad this sound didnt start coming later when I couldn't return the product ( its just 16 hrs since I got the product ) from now on I wont be buying *any* electrical products from Amazon. thank you😠",2
"I travelled by public conveyance full day and it's counting steps I don't know how. I have hardly walked 2km but it's showing 9754 steps. I removed band from my hand and tapped on heart beat measurement and it has shown 100 bpm of heart beat.

I wonder if I can exchange this one",2
Good phone for decent price was a gift for Mom n she's really very happy,2
"Not anything special. Bass is nowhere to be found. Audio is crisp. There is no padding on headband, soo cannot really use it for long hours. Good if you looking for some cheap headphones for show off purpose, but I wasn't really impressed with them.",2
"Design looks good but foot steps , heart rate and calories are burnt showing completely inaccurate which means if I keep 10 steps it shows 60 steps more. I have replaced 2 watches already and experience is same with all the 3 watches. Really disappointed!!!",2

Sound quality is but why buy earphone of 400 for 4 not good at all",2
Worst battery backup,2
"Adapter is of very poor quality. As it is an external component and not covered under warranty so quality of adapter is compromised. Within a week of delivery it stopped working, had to buy new costed extra Rs 600.",2
"Camera quality rate as 2.5/5, but performance is good
Not to go for camera lover's please. ....... ... . .",2
Design is good. Sound quality is not as per sony product. No value for money.,2
"Some notifications not not show in band 4.
Price high and performance down.

Products is good but there is no Bluetooth available..,2
Bad one......,2
A 4 antenna router means it covers more area but thats not the case I still find no network in my bedroom...,2

Way too much distance showing,2
"I am sharing my experience after one month of usage:
1. Average Sound Quality.
2. Poor Bass.
3. Poor Build Quality- Made with cheap quality plastic that only looks good in pictures.
4. Average Battery life of about 3 hrs ( continuous usage ).
5. Noise Cancellation- No ANC or ENC.
6. Poor Customer Care Service.
I am disappointed after buying it.",2
Product was in open condition and a used product. It was already registered with someone's name. Not expected at all........,2
"Print quality was excellent, good product for students, but capacity of ink cartidge is very poor, cost per page is very high",2

-Switching between activities could be made better",2
I ordered pebble grey but i got blue color...,2
"5 months usage update - microphone stopped working and with the ultimate careful usage the speaker seems to be shaken.. product is good but the quality and reliability is not so good for the money .. I could have gone for a skull candy which was reliable for more than 2 years ..

after these many months usage even the battery seems to drain faster than the initial time period ..

Awesome quality product.. using it for straight 9hrs of my working hours and I charge it three days once .. mainly using to connect with my mi4k audio while connecting to Bluetooth audio video lags on 4K and by aux audio is extremely low .. not sure if it’s Bluetooth issue or the mi4k tv issue.. hope I figure that out sooner ..",2
It's hanging and taking more time to access. .. Windows 10 consume more RAM. So 4 GB ram is not enough ..I purchased in the month of February 1 at week...2 Nd week Onwards problem started.. Very disappointed,2

"The wifi signal disconnected intermittently and frequently. Even though it is a dual band router the higher band has no proper connectivity.
Not satisfactory",2
"Not really a reliable product to use. First couple of days worked like a charm.
After that whenever tried to connect from the different room, experienced frequent disconnection.

Nothing wrong with the ISP as moving closer to the modem solves the above issue.
Also this router is having Hathway firmware by default.
One needs to call Dlink support to make it work for ACT.

Not recommended at all.",2
The phone is not worth the money. Realme phones are way better. You need not to waste money.,2
Worst camera quality. Performance wise not at all satisfactory. Brand new Phone is getting hang.,2

"no depth in music, music turns to noise",2
"The built quality is not great as per the pricing .
Limited features .Starp colour mentioned as Royal blue but is more of a light purple",2
Not very good. Wifi signal drop off is very poor. Not recommended for anyone wanting multiroom/big room coverage.,2
The speakers are not good. People can barely hear what I'm saying while using these,2
"Although the print quality. Is good, the ink consumption is high. Not budget friendly at all",2
"Have been using the router since 3 months. Inspite of having 3 antennas, signal range is very limited, poor and inconsistent wrt my old iBall two antenna router. Also, if the WiFi is not used for some time, it just disappears. Need to restart again for connectivity. Am surprised with this quality from TP Link. Will certainly not recommend this model.",2
"Hi all, redmi note 9 is a best phone in this range, its camera quality, design, processor and looks, all are good, but I got a problem in phones sensor, but amazon replaced it but again replaced items also have same problem, now amazon is going to refund me, is there anyone who have same sensor problem (while calling proximity sensor creating problem, anytime light of phone got on and off)",2
Not stable. Doesn't work with most of the vendor's connections.,2
"I am a professional singer and sound recorder. it has very bad sound quality. It sound not at all original. bluffy and bassy sound like someone covered the speakers with a thick blanket. No highs, no clarity. Surprised to see so many positive reviews.",2
Not enough ink in the cartridges,2
I bought it in October.. initially it gave good back up... Now(after 1year) it hardly gives not more than 20 mins,2
Ever since I bought this router I really started averaging download speeds of 15Mbps on my Laptop. Beating the 8 Mbps speeds that I was getting earlier. But I haven't been able to maintain a steady VPN connection to my office Network since I started using this router. This is frankly a disappointing and a headache to have to repeatedly connect.,2
"I brought tp-link N450 and install it,I have 2 bhk flat my first d-link router better than this and it has 2 antenna's it covered full my house and for tp-link ihave to get range extender cover my house.I install it in child bedroom surprisingly i see there is see no range in hall",2

"Sleep tracking is awsm but battery life is not good normal use 6 days heavy use 2.5 days
But spo2 monitor is worst 😫",2
Main speaker box speaker was not safe position any damage was come some time no guard was provided. Not like this .,2
It doesn't show accurate results in step count and naps!,2
"Pros-
Cheap headphone with good audio quality under this price range🤗

Cons-
1.Bass is not that deep.😑
2.This is a weird one- Due to very slight movement sometimes the headphone jack gets disturbed and suddenly Google home pops up out of nowhere when using it on mobile. And this occurs almost every time. I need to be very careful while connecting headphone to mobile so as not to disturb the headphone jack😑",2
Product is good but not working correctly,2
It was good for 2 weeks. But after that voice got very low. And i dont have service center near me.,2
It always shows paper jam and never prints. It really tiring. Need to give command 15-20 times to print paper. Not at all user friendly. WORST BUY.,2
Low. Quality,2
Touch is not at all sensitive. Sound quality is not that good. Range is okay. Sometimes doesnt re connect automatically.,2
I was an ardent fan of Philips products...I am totally disappointed from the present product..I am giving 2 stars because of my allegiance to Philips brand...but this model pathetically failed in all...only the BLUETOOTH connection was good..buy. The sound from woofer was really low..also the satellite speakers were little low in quality..I have returned the product and will not recommend to others .. although the stars received were by early reviewers the present reviews now point that the product is no good..sorry Philips..you let me down miserably...,2
"Sound Quality is Good
But they are not comfortable.
You can't even use them for more than 1 hour.
They are very tight as compared to normal headphones.",2
CHEAP AND HARD TO CONFIGURE,2

"Not recommended if you are looking for Bass headset, zero noise cancellation . Very disappointed with product at high prize.",2
Good in looks but below average in overall performance.,2
"Received an old sample which had been returned thrice (with all 3 slips in the box). The seller didn't even take the initiative of packing up the router properly inside the box or even taking out the previous slips. It was even dusty!
Coming to the performance of the router itself, nothing great to write about. Does it's job, easy to set up but mediocre coverage area. The app also does it's job but is far from comprehensive compared to say the Asus app. Just sucks that it doesn't have as good of a coverage area as my previous Asus. That being said, it seems to be reliable and runs much cooler. Won't return it back only because I can't wait for another router.",2
"Issues while connecting to Wifi, Very Slow OS",2
"Observed high latency even at 5-10 feet radius when connected via wifi, issue has been reported to tech support. Although tech support folks are comfortable to connect with but issue has not been resolved.",2

"There are too many flaws issues in the watch and it is completely not worth the money

I use iphone and Xiaomi note 8 pro phone and both were facing some or the other issue.

1. Connecting to bluetooth takes atleast 10-15 secs every time.

3. Connectivity issue with apple

4. Screen activation is super slow when you turn the wrist. And some times you simply have to touch and wakeup the screen.

5. When find my phone is pressed phone gets hang.

6. Not able to control music.

Mic is useless..Other side always complains of not being able to hear...One side stopped completely..So basically life looks to be of 3-5months,2

Battery backup is a total waste,2
WiFi coverage not good.,2
Cartridge so much problem and printer give worst print,2
It's of no use for me thought it would be good but in the end I gave to one of friend as a gift.,2
Product comes with 6 month of limited warranty. My bad luck it stopped working just after 6 months 😭. I checked with Customer care and they do not provide any service for repair. This is cheap Chinese kind of product. If it works your good luck otherwise waste of Money. Better to go for APC which comes with 2 Year Warranty and good Service.,2

"Battery drains fast, causes skin irritation and redness.
Recognizes activity (walking, running, etc) after a long period-- usually after I've walked 1 km it asks if I am walking to register workout (or else you can also do that manually but it's too tedious and to drains battery in one day only if you want to track all physical activity).
But for this price, it's okay if there are these drawbacks.",2
"Hi I have been using Mi band 5 last 28 days, The only issue I'm facing is battery draining. And the main reason is Auto heart rate sensor is working even after turned this feature off on the mi Fit app. Sensor lights are flashing randomly though it's turned off. This is so frustrating. I'm not a heavy user. But it consumes 10% charge for 4-6 hrs of uses. ACCURACY is not that great or bad. In my opinion Go for Galaxy Fit 2 which is cost ₹3999.",2

Baterry quality is very bad not lasts for 24 hours also .And every time a lost connectivity with mobile,2
There is no expected sound,2
"I have used this product for last one year on BSNL broadband connection. Ever since this router was installed many Apps on my Samsung Galaxy ON 7 Pro stopped working. Few examples are Yahoo mail, Flipkart, e-mitra and Uber. Same apps work fine with Netgear router on same connection.
Same apps also work on mobile data. Amazon App too works in fts and starts. This has been a waste of money and time as I am forced to use my old router.",2
Not nice .finger print reader work very slow.sound not good,2
Connectivity is good but sum disturbance in mic,2
Not soo happy with the watch. Look wise it's OK but you don't have much option such where I have used MI fit band previously and in that I had good option in the menu and it was more user friendly. But this is not worth for the price,2

"Hi Everyone, Being Honest; the speakers are not at all upto the mark.
Problems:
1) On some frequencies the speakers start distorting to a complete next level. Those sound sounds absolutely perfect on my 10 year old iBall speakers.
2) The bass to sound ratio is not at all appropriate, if you want to feel the bass, you'll have to really turn up the volume.

Don't buy them for good bass. The size and shape is like a disguise.",2
It doesn't fit into the ear properly and there is no refund policy if product if it is not suitable,2

one side stopped working,2
The product readings are not accurate. Not worthy.,2
Value for money and better connectivity. But can't be used as repeater or range extender. UI is also bit confusing and not easy to understand. UI is better in netgear d1500 and can also be used as reapeter. Connectivity n range is good in dlink.,2

"I cannot write a review in a situation when music system is not functioning properly.

When I received the product, I found the seal on Sub-Woofer was damaged. I ignored that tried to connect USB to play some music. Unfortunately, USB was not detected by the system. I tried with the same USB which I am using in my car, but I thought there are more than 1000+ songs and may take time to read and play music.

After that, I have tried with another USB device with 10+ songs and selected USB mode. Unfortunately, it didn't work. I was surprised and tried to check Bluetooth function. It worked fine and finally, I was able to play music on this system, but I had disappointment.

Sub-woofer not worked. I have tried with 5.1 Channel DVD player, but it didn't work too.

Overall,

"The product was nicely packed and delivered. That is the only nice thing about the the product.

It has very limited range. I installed it in my dining room and I had problem accessing the wifi from my bedroom which is just 20-25 ft away from the router.

If you looking for decent range router,this is not for you.

Thankfully Amazon took the return and I have replaced it with other brand.",2
Good product but bad battery. You will need to change the battery every ~18 months. Better to go for regular UPS,2
Very bad range only 15 meters,2
HAVE TO SEE THE WORKING OBVER PERIOD OF TIME,2
"Pairing the device is a big challenge. Within three days i installed the app 10 times.

Also the notifications are not happening all times.

I was not happy, but Amazon is saying we can only exchange the product. If the customer is not happy, then u should take back the product. Don't insist him to use it once again the same new one.

First impression is the best impression",2
"Product is easier to install, customize & monitor internet usage per device & excellent optimizations in app.

However most important factor considered from wifi router is signal strength, for my usage it's poor than a single antennae model from other brands

Pros
1. Easy to install
2. Customisation in app
3. Each device can be provided separate bandwidth
4. Monitoring of usage via app

Cons
1. Poor signal even with four antennae
2. Frequent signal drops.",2

Today 3/6/2020 I am writing this follow-up review for this modem. There seems to be a firmware issue now. The modem signal is okay but not strong enough to connect with my laptop with Windows 10 OS and inbuilt Wi-Fi adopter. Network service provider is asking me to change this modem.

On 26/6/2020 I want to contact the supplier and get a replacement for this modem. Not able to reach any one from Amazon.",2

Not having much range.. go for other product..,2
The sound quality was not very fascinating but it is good.The bass was of worst quality You cannot feel the bass infact that there is a 12nm driver but the best thing about this is the battery backup You can use it about for 1 and a half hour within any pause,2
Good for 290 to 300 sqft house not best for 2room have short range 2.5 and 5ghz works fine,2
Performance cannot be said to be satisfactory. Camera quality expected more. No issues with calling and networking.,2
"Poor quality product overall compared to similarly priced products I bought (iBall Decibel BT01) together with this one:

Poor Audio quality
Poor quality and shorter cables.
Poor aesthetic
It's lightweight (only positive)

BT Versions 5 don't add any value. May cause compatibility issue with BT Versions below 4.2

Battery backup claimed for this headset is 9 Hrs @50% Volume as oppose to 6 Hrs claim of iball @100% Volume.",2
"Update after using the watch for a few days:
Its metrics are all wrong. Played a vigorous game of football for an hour and it showed calories burnt after the game as approx 100 while it would have been closer to 500-700! It didnt even register the sport.
The watch interface just doesnt respond many times, the app is very difficult to handle, app freezes many times in a day.the overall usability is very frustrating.
Activity auto detect is not there - u need to put on the activity before starting. service centre is unreachable most of the times. Customer experience is extremely pathetic and frustrating.

THIS FITNESS TRACKER SEEMS TO BE ALL HYPE BUT DOESNT DELIVER!! If only they had a return option, I would have returned it. No wonder they didnt keep a return option because the product is just good looking trash!! Will never buy an amazfit product again i guess. Have put it up for selling at a discount on OLX!!
—————————————
First and foremost, This is a fitness tracker, NOT a smartwatch!
There has been a lot of hype and resulting demand for the Amazfit GTS 2 mini. The watch looks good, finishing is very nice, display is superb. But, beyond that, there is nothing much to say because the interface, using the watch, the Zepp app are all very clunky and sometimes, very frustrating. The manufacturer seems to have thought that offering only a good display at a cheap price will do the trick. it is the usage which determines the real utility of the watch. Always remember that the watch alone is not enough; the app also has to be upto the mark.
The manufacturer has tried to include a lot of things but missed a few simple things which are needed. E.g. sports mode has an equestrian mode, hunting, fishing etc. but not the basic football/soccer!!! Now, how many play equestrian sports or hunt or fish compared to how many play football/soccer?? The workouts have a lot of fancy stuff but some basic stuff like HIIT is missing. it takes a long time to find some basic features like countdown clock or stopwatch - this is stuff which should be readily available and accessible!!!
What other fitness trackers/bands do basically intuitively (like setting fitness goals, workout minutes etc.) are either too tough to figure out on this or not absent. E.g. in other basic trackers, one can set a goal of a standard 30 minutes walk/run but in this you need to do it every single time!
The app is too clunky with a few things present there and a few things on the watch. it takes quite a lot of time to figure out what feature is in what and then work accordingly.
Buying this watch is equal to getting a snazzy-looking, apple watch lookalike at a cheap price but getting frustrated on a daily basis while using it!!!
And they are not accepting returns, just replacing the item. So, welcome to getting frustrated regularly!
Better to buy a basic fitness band/tracker of any good company than buying this one!",2
First of all amazon to much time take to deliver about half month video quality is avarage it doesn't support 4k video battry backup is likely to good so go for it,2
Right ear not working at all after usage of 25 days,2
It is not user friendly and not as per my expectations,2

The HP laptop often looses wifi connectivity. I never had issue with wifi on other laptops I used earlier . I had to reconnect to wifi manually and again the connection drops . I have little or no confidence whether the laptop would stay connected to wifi .

The other issue is the print on the keys of the laptop . Print started to fade already . With a bit more laptop usage , the print on the Keys E, R, D,C and V will appear much lighter than the rest of the keys . Overall not very much satisfied with my purchase .",2
"Hp3835 is good printer for occassionally printing requirement. Ink consumption is very high than comitted. Also ink gets dry if printer is kept idle for a week time. Cost of ink cartidge ranges from 1200-1600 Rs. Montly consumtion 1600 ~2800 Rs. Overall costlier affair to buy this printer. Photo print is good, but you have to use photo paper like kodak glossy paper. If your requirement of print is higher then I will recommend B&W HP 1020. Its excellent and cheap print cost. This printer cannot work with refilled cartidges.",2
Product is good af but i having some problem with its brightness... When brightness is on manual mode its automatically blinks low and high.. lil disappointed,2
"I requested for product replacement as soon as I listened to a song using this headphone. The bass quality is not good. Treble is way more than the base which I don't like at all. My old headphone is way better than this one maybe it's because they are of same brand and so they're more compatible with eachother but whatever the case I'm replacing this item to order the previous headphone.

And also if the headphone jack is slid even a little bit a disturbance noise appears which is another issue.",2

"Quality is compromised- This is my 2nd headphones of Boat. Difference is,
1. cloth material used in headphones speaker which comes over ear is also not good, too much thin
2. In current order the connector wire quality is not good, its too much thin.
4. they have not provided seprate bag to take care of headphones, the same was provided in last times. It's useful to keep headphones when u r not using it.",2
Ok. Not very good. I can't use multiple lan ports at once. I tried connecting lan cable to laptop nd TV. Buy doesn't work. Power also not so much like BSNL modem. I have BSNL modem which is good but no option of offing wifi. So I bought this.,2

"Reviewing after 8 9 months of use.
I have a gigabit ethernet connection, but still it only supports 300 Mbps only on 5G WiFi band(Not mentioned on the box) and on 2.4ghz it only gives out 50 Mbps max. Don't go for it thinking it will serve you good.
1. Reboot takes more than 3 4 mins.
2. Need to schedule a reboot schedule as on Pppoe connection it gives out errors in every 2 3 days.
3. Even when ipv4 connection is established, it will not allow the internet to pass through neither on WiFi nor on Lan.( You need multiple restarts)
4. Range is Just adequate for a 2 floored house. But still I had to get another cheap router for my other floor.
5. Gigabit Ethernet works fine.
6. It has issues on 2.4ghz with ping. Ex- if I am getting 2 ms ping on Lan, on 2.4 GHz band it would be around 15 ms.

Verdict
Value for money 6/10
Performance 4/10

If you can afford to buy a router from ASUS or NETGEAR ,then only buy them I still have 6 7 year old Asus and Netgear which just work flawlessly.",2

There's a contact interference in the background. The noise cancellation isn't that good. I bought it because of the brand value but was thoroughly disappointed by the performance. I had a pair of Sony earphone before this which were way better in all aspects.,2
This device too doesn't support more than 100 mbps. It's false written 867 mbps and it's been confirmed by ACT technician. It has only 2 copper lines and one which support 5G will have 4 copper line.,2
"The activity tracking is totally inaccurate. UNFORTUNATELY I NOTICED IT EXACTLY A DAY AFTER RETURN EINFIW IS VLOSED , YES ITS JUST 12 DAYS OLD. If I walk 6+ km it reports less than 1/2 km. The telephone support is equally BAD. They keep saying I should fully charge it which makes no sense. According to support it should always be 100% charged for accurate reporting. If it still doesn't work I need to take it a support center that's 3hours awy in Bangalore
Only thing that's accurate us time and steps. And the screen looks good.",2
The screen getting spot's.,2
Signal keeps on dropping all the time. My third room is not that tricky even though signal strength is very poor. Wasn't expecting this from D-Link. I used D-Link before but this is worse or Amazon.,2
Good quality nice product,2
For this price product is ok(rs 349). But overall not a great product. Bass quality is superb. But i don't know why people boast it. Once you get a headphone with immersive sound quality you never choose for bass only. I had a mi headphone which superb for immersive experience. Comparing that this is not good. I suggest buy more quality headphone if you can afford the price. Its good if your budget is around 400rs,2
"Noise cancellation does not work. I can hear everything but the person on other side can't hear property at all, unless you are alone in a room. Most of the time I've to put my phone on doeaker mode to talk as other person cannot hear.

Though it is a privacy night mare, I just use it for step tracking, quick notifications and time keeping, does the job.
The watch face options are terrible and the default one is the best to be honest.
I think it is waterproof but you might want to buy a cover for the tiny screen.
Above all, it is cheap, so I don't want to complain much.
The battery is decent too. I think I charged a total of five times in the past two months.",2

"App. - After a few days, I think, Amazon, Flipkart shall be replaced by Goqii app. Yes, it sells online coaching, live training, body nutrients, food supplements, t-shirt other smart device ... what not?! Now, after long investigation, I found a small icon at top that will bring you in your required place. Here you can add the watch to app. But ... You have to synchronise manually every time. It is a market place rather than a serious health tracking app

B.P. Measure - You may get customised bp as you wish !! The watch can not measure bp if it is not linked to app. Now, the first time when you link the watch to measure bp, the app says for calibration. You need to put 3 pre measured bp readings in the app. Game starts from now ... The watch gives you an av. reading of the 3 input reading as given by you for calibration. Just for checking, I gave 3 very high bp readings and the watch returns high av. on my hand. Then I gave 3 low readings and got in return low av. bp on my same hand !!

Steps - Worked on table for 30 mins ... Watch shows 92 steps !!

I think, exercise on these basic fields are ssufficient for not drilling any further ...",2

"The earcups and the overall size of the headphones is quite small, it's just about enough for my head at the max adjustment level. Sound quality is nothing exceptional, it's just okay. The mic is kinda bad but it's usable. It came with a 3.5mm to 6.5 mm aux cable and a micro-USB to USB-A cable in-box. There is one 3.5mm port on one side and one 6.5mm on another for some reason, not sure why they couldn't just give a 3.5mm on both sides but that's not really an issue. Two stars because they're too uncomfortable and I cannot return and refund these, only replacements are available.",2
"Goqii smart vital, according to me, is a match for Apple smart watches. Having said that I must add that it's user manual is miserable, most unsuited for even tech-savvy people, let alone layman.
Another drawback is that it's claimed feature""find my phone"" doesn't work. Goqii replaced the watch even in the replaced watch this feature did not work.
While I should add that customer care is not bad, they could not solve the problem. I wasted lot of time cooperating with them to resolve the problem.",2

But is super bad at basic things that make it super annoying to use like slow and faulty wrist wake, super inconsistent charging, worst is exercise modes gets changed to different when pulled into app!

Over priced . You can go for a normal ups at this price,2
Its wire is so so so thin and delicate that i need to handle it very gently nd softly...!! If you like a rough and tough product then you will definately face problem while using this.. The sound quality needs to be improved..,2

Call quality is not at all upto the mark,2

Not reached to expected level and I was totally disappointed with this and I recommend to canon 200d instead of this and delivery was not that much great and I was prime member I reached product after 4 days,2
It's an amazing product but the one thing lack is bass control its poor. At this price range it could have given better features . Atleast the bass should be powerful. But that the worst thing. Don't buy if you are bass lover. I love when everything near me vibrate it feels out of universe overall it's ok ok.,2
The bluetooth connection is not good.range is very low..disconnect when talking with in 1 to 2 miter..very bad quality..do not buy it..,2
"Headphones sound quality is nice... I got it in 3 days. It came in a very good condition.
Pros

Headphones are really great for this sound quality

These are dual function so u can use them via Bluetooth as well as aux cable(they do provide aux cable)

Battery charging time is good.. It can be used for continous 2-3 days with 1hr charging time.

Noise cancellations is very good

Very handy. Can be folded.. Into a compact form and also to 180degree angle

Headphone can be adjusted accordingly.

Sound quality is similar if use it with Bluetooth or with aux cable(which is great)

Cons

Sometimes Create disturbances.. Even I'm in a different room ranging 6-7m

If used for a longer time..ear hurts very much(but if u adjust the earcup u can reduce the amount of pain)

Bass is not that great...though not very bad.

Overall nice purchase... Mine came with one USB cable, aux cable,warrenty card, and instruction manual. (Pictures are attached pls refer)

Edit. After 5months of normal usage these headphones sometimes stops working suddenly,the Bluetooth is not at all great and now they r broken.the extenders are very weak and cheap plastic quality materials. I'm in my warranty period but they don't serve for physical damage. Very bad. I'm not going to purchase boats product again. Cheap quality product. They lure the customers into buying with their fake material quality.,sound quality, but only after usage u get to no Abt the reality.
I'll not recommend these to anyone",2
Earphone s was working good for 2 months later one side of earphone stopped working poor quality product.please buy boat instead of this crap.,2

"Today I have received white color Redmi note 9 4gb 64gb version. When I ooen the box, first I noticed that it is not labled as Made in India .. it is completely Chinese product... Even charger also have label as made in china. Second thing I noticed a big scratch start from camera to bottom... How can I believe it is a new product.... Totally disappointed with it.",2
When it was working it worked well..but one earplug has stopped working,2
"Two stars because I could not use my USB DATA MODEM and also I'm not able to use with Cable Modem.
Cons: It has a USB port where you could only use D-Link USB data MODEM, we cannot use SIM-less Data like MTS etc.,also we cannot use LAN port as WAN port for cable modems",2
"This is very small,not like what you in pic, like the ones you got earlier with your desktop PC.

Amazon should take action against saller for this major mistake.",2

"Do not buy this router if you want a wifi zone within 800 sq ft to 1000 sq ft. One of the worst experience with this router is, it provides best signal within a room, but as you move to the adjacent room, the signal drops. I would not recommend this product. Better to go for digisol products. Far far better",2
"I'm not sure if it's only for my device or for all.
I see a constant drop from 150Mbps to 50 Mbps everytime. It needs resetting again and again to gain back speed.
Please consider this risk before buying. All other options (their GUI, signal strength) are working fine.",2
Doesn't feel like original. The one i have now is a replacement the previous one was the worst like a local item with buzzing and noises,2

"Installation and every thing is simple.
But the max internet speed you will get is 95-100 mbps. Because the incoming port supports only till 100 mbps. The speed promised confuses the buyers and they let users think that we will get atleast 400 mbps on both bands separately.",2
Average sound clarity. I do not enjoy listening music on it. I find apple earpods to be way better than this,2
Hardly gets 10 color prints in 1 cartridge.,2
"Build quality is average. This is my 5th earphone of same product, and always they got defected from wire joint near audio jack.",2
Not able to get refill for printer,2
"Well guys if you want a cheap product like I wanted please go for the same. You will get all decent features within your tracker including ""stress monitoring"" ""heart beat"" ""PAI"" ""multiple sports"" modes etc. but in terms of accuracy it lags. Frankly speaking I haven't used any other fitness tracker of any other brand so I can't say whether they are better performing in this range.

Now let me tell you where it lags
Sports Mode - in all the sports mode it has gives fairly correct details including steps calculation, however you are doing strength training in gym it fails to add anything towards counting of your steps.

Steps Calculator - well if you keep motion detection or activity detection all the time I don't know it counts your steps. Recently I was on a road trip by car we went through a bad patch of road for almost 2 hours and it calculated them as steps as if I am walking.

Sleep tracker - Well it's pretty decent but at times it is unable to differentiate whether I am sleeping or just lying on bed and timings of sleep on certain days are inaccurate. Additionally the MI fit app is no good as it hasn't improved much over the years.

Heart Beat - Well its accurate at times but at times I noticed during my strength training in gym when I am pretty sure that my heart beat is high it shows as normal.

Stress Monitoring - it's just a namesake feature and it can't accurately predict the mental stress you are going through

Touch Interface - very poor. At times it doesn't wakes up even after touching few times and at night if the screen gets accidental touches anywhere it just wakes up. Some kind of accidental touch feature should be there.

So guys please think before putting your money on this and please don't get lured to review videos on YouTube where they get paid for providing positive reviews.",2
"Only works well till 60 % volume ,turning up volume after that makes the sound too distorted and its painful to listen.
Base is ok .
But may want to spend some extra bucks to get a decent earphone for long term.",2
"Too tight.
You cant wear it more than half an hour.
Your ears will start paining.",2
Battery is an issue and unfortunately they don't have option to replace only battery. It's more of use and throw product.,2
Totally waste of money camara quality very bad this not 12mp lens processer working like a 2gb this mobile prooved china made 😞😞😞😞😞,2
"The band has reasonable number of features but is incompatible with the phone I use and so has limited utility as a standalone fitness asssessory compared to other bands. This doesn't show any notifications when connected to Redmi Note 5 Pro.
Other than this, I've tried it to track swimming and it has done a very poor job of tracking swimming. It doesn't detect strokes and gets the distance wrong.",2
The product is good.... Only the thing is refilling is extremely costly and trust me i used all the possible jugars but nothing worked . u have to purchase new bottle .,2
Battery poor quality,2
"Feedback for Seller only: Missing cable from box, must be opened returned item. Returned for replacement, then 2nd time received proper box with plastic seal pack covered.

Product feedback: its great for 80MB plan, gives wider coverage for 4G in 1300 sq ft flat, mostly 40-60MB or so, have router in one end of flat. If we go in far location - although the wifi-signal shows 2 lines only, the actual speed and data upload download you get is 5-10 MB. which served the purpose. 5G signal covers only 800 sq ft or so, then further apart - connection hangs or drops.",2

"Sound quality is worse than a normal earphone. I doubt if it's an original piece. I have been using Sony products for more than 2 decades and the sound quality is one thing, which is impeccable quality of Sony products. But this headphone doesn't have any of the sound quality..doesn't even sound decently stereo let alone any bass or noise cancellation features. It's a sham product sold.",2

"I bought this in March 2019, but started using it or more to say unwrapped just 2 weeks back. The initial setup was good quite easy. Range in 2.4 ghtz is ok not great but the speed it sends in 2.4 is quite less. I mean almost 30 to 40 Mbps drop from the original 100 mbps it receives. In 5 Ghtz I could receive the speed as is but the range is very poor understandably.
Worst problem is heating up. The router heats up very fast and the input port (internet input port) stopped working 2 days before. So the life time is just around 10 days. Now the router is not working at all. I've to reach out to the customer support as it's weekend there is no support. Will post an update once I could reach out to them.",2

"1. About Product :
You will get extra time to save your stuff online.
2. Back-up hour :
Initially 3-4 hour and after few months it will come down to an hour.
3. Value for money :
I bought this product last year (2016) and that time it cost me 1200, now they increased product price by 700. Now, it is very expensive compare to what you get.
4. Service:
Their service is kind of OK

Product is good but Expensive",2
"The product is clearly overrated. For 500 bucks i would say the product is overpriced, it's just the brand you are paying. The build is quite light, it looks like one of those local Chinese earphones . The sound quality is okayish. My complementary Samsung earphones provided better sound quality. The wire lenght is just fine not too long , easy to detangle. Noise cancellation is good though and bass is alright. At times the voice gets buzzy even after being properly connected.",2
"The remote is not working,need a replacement for the same",2
"Delivered early.
Set-up easily.
clarity is good for the price and 2MP.
ONLY the problem is that it got connected at the first setup without any problem.
But after the power went off and came back, it does not connect to the wifi automatically, moreover, tried to connect manually and it never worked. it says to reset, did it more than 10 times. The phone connected to the Camera but the camera cannot connect to WiFi at all. It keeps saying ""Connecting to WiFi"" forever.

"If you think that this printer is cost effective then read this before purchasing.

Printer claims: 6000 black pages, 7000 color pages, total 13000 pages in 1880₹ ink bottles which are 4 in number.

It also uses two print heads or cartridges which are CA92 and CA91, combined cost is around ₹5000.

5000+1880 equals ₹6880. In that much amount printer claims to print 13000 black and color pages, please take note that this number is only talking about color pages and not color photo prints.

So, the average cost per print is ₹1.9 which is ₹1.70 higher than canon claimed cost (20paise).

There's no info about the life of print heads and when they needs to be changed.

So, suppose even if you complete 13000 pages and then buy new ink set for ₹1880 then it is not mentioned that whether you have to purchase the new print heads with ink bottles or the old ones can be used. If replacement is needed then be ready to shell out another ₹5000 for cartridges.

This printer is only cost effective if its print heads last for a very long time otherwise not.

Don't get fooled.",2
"Don't buy this if u want to use it while riding 2 wheeler, can't hear, u need to keep adjust it... I'm very much frustrated because of this... But for normal use this is good....",2

"Reviewing After using 4 months , now it’s not working properly, automatically getting disconnected while on the call .",2
"Lots of useless manufacturer and google apps. You open the box and it feels like you're using someone else's phone. Additionally, they cant be uninstalled. Hogs up 14 GB of 32 GB space and you're left with only 18 GBs. And if you're using two sims you cant even insert a memory card to store pics/music or whatever.

Ads everywhere! You open any of their apps, even the system apps, and adds are there to greet you.

Does not come with a fingerprint senser.

Battery life is decent but lets see how it works 6 months from now.

Has an ugly(imo) screen tint as default. And for some reason, every time I restart I have to set the tint and turn off auto-brightness all over again. Idk if it's a fault or I am not doing it right.

Screen guard and back cover not included in the box as is the norm with some other manufacturers.

Comparing it with Honor 8c which I bought last year for roughly the same price (8.3k), this phone's resolution is massively inferior to Honor's even though they both claim it to be 720 x 1520 pixels.

Very disappointed and underwhelmed with this purchase. Only keeping it because it was the cheapest phone (among newer releases) in the 32gb/3gb category on amazon. You save your money to buy an entry level phone and still it doesn't feel personalised. Fed up with these proprietary devices. Linux mobile distros cant come soon enough.",2
The display is not a full screen.... Poor old school look.... Poor resolution....,2
"******* UPDATED REVIEW AFTER MORE THAN 18 months OF USE*******

Down voting my previous review to only 2 stars.
This product sucks.
The only good thing about it is range.
It disconnects after certain hours (there's a red light on the router)
It works fine after restarting the router (So no fault of ISP)
Don't buy this!
Better go for a TP-LINK 2 antenna router even if it costs more.
A real pain to restart it again and again.
And by the law: It goes down whenever you need it the most. -_-

Also heats up more as comapred to TP-Link route

********************** OLD REVIEW only after 6 months of usage ***********************
1. Range is good. Signal is strong 3 rooms away.
2. Internet doesn't work after 20-24 hrs. When I reboot it, it works alright.
3. D-Link software is very complicated.
4. As some ppl have mentioned, my seller promised me a USB port, but it has no USB port.

Go for a TP-Link router with similar specifications.",2

"Here my product review after usage of 3 months.

Cons:
If you bought this mobile you can't exchange. I have tried but not able to exchange my device.

Please check by clicking the exchange option and you can take the decision.

Now you can understand why you should not by this mobile.

Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics game

Battery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate perform
For charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100.

Macro camera - useless feature

Front and Rear camera - Not good compare with realme 6000rs mobile camera.

UI is fine but consuming more ram

Many pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).

I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.",2
To good,2
"Good for 4-7 mins of backup for router, but not more than that. And it is dead now just after 1 year warranty expiration. So I think it is better to spend 2000 Rs for a full UPS from established brands which comes with 2 years warranty for device and battery like luminious. Not a promoter of any brand, was just checking the best value of my investment (~2k) for router backup need). Cannot shell out 2k every year for this need.",2
"before this i had F&D A180X the sound clarity of that product is awesome but bass was not that powerful.
bught this speaker from flipkart in big billion day sale cause of sbi card offer.
speaker is loud and really good with few cons:
1. sound clarity is little low in comparison with A180X.
2. bass changes itself with the increase n decrease in sound. so u may have to set basse everytime u change the volume.
3. Faced bluetooth auto disconnect issue 1 time.
4. be careful with the bass u can damage ur speaker cause bass has no limit. there are 30 levels or steps for both sound and bass volume separately. if u have set bass to the maximum level(30) at low volume level(suppose 1) and then u increase the volume the bass also starts to increase beyond its limit with the volume and subwoofer starts to crackle at volume level between 5 and 10. if u further increase the volume the subwoofer will get damage for sure.
5. remote design is really poor. it works but looks like a cheap chinese 3rd class product.

pros:
1. the bass is really awesome far better than A180X
2. loud with decent vocals and poor treble. There is a lack of crispness in sound.
3. FM with good reception.
4. bluetooth version 4.0 or 4.2(it is 4.0 in manual but 4.2 on official site).
5. overall sound signature is little bit warmer side.",2

"The wifi signal range is not good within 2-3 meters of distance also. If you close the door of the room, the signal strength reduces and even 100 mbps lease line will give you effectively 10 mbps or so.

They had fad far better sound as well as bass quality than this one...Boat has got more middle frequency and sounds fat. The design looks appealing but I am not satisfied with the sound. For wire, there is no damage till now but I am pretty suspicious for how long would it last. The length is just a bit small for me. Also the buds did not fit my ear correctly. I am using the old ones from my previous earphones and they are very comfortable for me.",2
"Touch isssue: The top of the screen is not working. This is a major problem because Eid which you can set alarm, or use stop watch or set anything related to top part of the screen.
Loosely fits into hand .",2
Sound quality is really poor. My older Envent Beatz earphones are much better than this one. Not expected this quality from Boat. Poor Bass also.,2
"I bought this product on 23rd July 2016. The battery stopped charging somewhere around October 2017. I checked with the vendor and it seems to replace the battery will cost as much as buying a new one.

This product is good as long as one is buying a new one in every 18 months.",2
"It sound quality is normal, it's your budget earphone",2
"Sound quality is good but it’s not comfortable for ears at all,after listening for a while it feels harsh and bass quality is very poor which makes music vibrant and doesn’t feel good to hear !",2
"I am not buying this product again because it's not good in fitting on the ears , sound quality is less than fine and product is fragile .
In future I would pay some extra to get a better quality headphone , something that can actually be usefull.",2
"It's ink cartridge are been completed only for 10 prints only so, please buy another printer",2
Never recommend anyone to purchase any product from Canon that too via Amazon. Both organisation in terms of customer handling are worst and worst. Canon is highly unprofessional and least bothered about customer. Even they mentioned go and return back to Amazon we don't even dame care.,2
Fast charge doesn't work. Takes very long time to charge the phone phone hangs often while opening apps,2
"The product was already returned by some other Amazon user because when I tried to install it i can see that someone already messed up with the settings. It took me 2hours to set the router. Packing quality was pathetic and delivery was a pain, delayed delivery almost 2 days late.",2
All things are great. but I am facing battery problem and it's really serious problem....,2
"This is an Honest review after using the Headphones for 10 Days (Boltt 140).Don't fall for the false reviews. Everyone has done it for free Gaana Subscription and a free movie ticket(Bik gye sb).

Build Quality of the Headphones is awesome and the Cushion is soft. But with time(only 10 days here), the padding becomes less spongy and the Headphones become uncomfortable to wear.

Music: The music quality is decent with good Bass. But Don't expect the quality of Boat or Jbl or Sony.There is a static cracking noise in the Bluetooth Mode.

Connectivity: Fast and Hassle free.. Bluetooth range is about 15-20 feet, after that no sound come.

Gaming: Not great for Gaming, Cannot hear footsteps clearly.Even Headphones at a lesser price perform better. Mic is good and noise free.

Calling: Not good for calling, no noise cancellation, you can hear people whispering near you too on the other phone( the one with which u are talking).

Overall: Not a great product, just a decent one. Copy of AudioTechnia A71 , nowhere near it. The same Headphones are available for 1699 as Claw Sm50 on Amazon. Just rebranded and extra looting.

Returinh it back.",2
the product i got was not same as given in the picture,2
"Voice quality is very poor...doesn't met my expectations
JBL is known for its quality.. But my product is not good...",2
"I have been using TP-link product for the last 5 years. My previous experience was good but this product is not working as per my expectation. My last product was Portable 3G/4G wireless N router (TL-MR3020). This was broken down after 5 years and it was 2.4 band wireless. Therefore I bought Archer C50 dual band wireless, but its range is the same as the earlier router. Whereas Archer has two dedicated antennae but still its range is not as per expectation. TP-link could have used better Antenna for this product.",2
Got a defective product - the printer simply refuses to power off and never senses paper feed.,2
Remote doesn’t work after a month,2
Please don't buy. Printing is really costly. Not able to print 30 to 40 pages. I bought recently and not able to return also.,2
Very haviy wait camera not good,2
"Poor connectivity. It cannot be connected for long time, even the device is kept too close to the phone. It freequently getting disconnected automatically. Rest of all like sound quality,charging time,standby time, good.",2
Battery backup is not up to the mark.csmera is good according to the price but fingerprint scanner is poor,2
Have not paired the device yet but the band is of very cheap quality. I had used Mi Band 4 and its band quality was superb..this one looks like its a counterfeit product.,2
"I will mention only one point which is horrible,in this printer according to me,u cannot connect it via USB cable only,it won't work,u cannot connect it with cellphone or laptop directly via wifi.It will connect only with a third party wifi signal to which the laptop or signal is connected.lastly the worst part u cannot connect two devices one after another if u connect second device then the first device won't connect again.Start up is also very slow and takes a lot of time,there is no screen on the printer touch screen panel",2
Paper strucks always,2
Product is awesome but built quility could have been better. Point here is Amazon service lift was not working of my building and the delivery called me and said Mai upar nahi aa Sakta. I was like wtf. At last mujse he Jana pada.,2
No accuracy for how much walking or running.and no connectivity when calls coming.,2
Smol size,2
I am not sure why the band is not showing the calories burned? We use a band to track step count and calorie burned? But this is not showing the total calories burned. I wll have now go for another band as this feature is not avlb in this band.,2
On the CD written 2130 but on printer is 2131 and on you app also 2131 . what is this your product is worst,2
The camera and display is not good as expected with 390 ppi the videos show blur. . Need to improve camera quality and performance,2
"Bass very very low but he is telling extra bass come s
But it is fake please don't buy if u want bass sounds
If u want High noise voice it will buy excellent",2
"Why we wear these watches, for sensor, and its sensor is worst. Better get a fit-bit band. Even you sit in a vehicle it will count as foot steps.",2
Not that much volume what I have been thought 🙁,2
"After purchase of 5 days only, one of the speaker not working/ no sound at all.",2
No gaurantee card received . Product is good but no doccuments received.,2
Sound is good but it has Low quality plastic cable... Started getting holes and tears after few months..,2
"Very very poor range even compared to normal tends wireless router
The speed drops in 10 meters

Avoid avoid",2
Fingerprint setup is not good it s damaged sensor so don't early to choose this product,2
"I read few negative feedback but still trusted 'JBL''s brand, but the time I plugged them in my computer, I was heartbroken.
Worst ever bass, I am not asking for a Metal Music Bass, but a basic bass is also needed for music.
The sound quality is similar to the headphones to get in Flight.",2
nice good,2
Shutdown button is not working,2
"Bass quality is superb. However, sound clarity is poor, words don't come out very cleary and vocals are not sharp at all",2
"Don't buy this product as it has connection issues. Once u connect ur phone, it will still be connected even if you place back the earphones in the case. On the other hand mic was not good,the voice was husky",2
"Full signal coming in first room only, after one room signal lossing",2
"Pros:
1. Sturdy
2. Good for music
3. Good mobile connectivity

Cons:
1. Keeps disconnecting from laptop
2. Even if connected, keeps dropping from calls - I need to disconnect and reconnect to be able to hear
3. Scratch prone plastic
4. While on calls, the folks on the other side complained about echos

Bottom line: My purpose was for taking calls as well as listen to music while working on my laptop (with the headphones connected to my laptop). The purpose was not served, hence returned the same",2
sound quality is very fantastic but they seem to be very weak.these headsets are too small for people with large heads,2
"I can't expect such low quality product from JBL.
It just look like a 100 rs earphone.
The base is totally absent.
I already used JBL t160,cause of which I prefer this earphone but it is very much below average.",2
it's not value for money,2
"Huge errors in measuring:
1. Temperature (error in the range of 2 to 3 degrees). My temperature measured with a calibrated thermometer was 97.5 and it always showed 100 plus.
2. SPO2 (error in the range of 4 to 5 percent). My SPO2 was in the range of 94-95 (measured with the help of 2 different devices available with doctor) and it always showed 99.

I thought the problem might be with this particular device, got the device replaced, but still the errors are same. So, the problem is with technology. Can Goqii refund my money?",2
Not as powerful as it appears,2
"Has limited feature. ""Smartwatch"" is not the word which justifies the product. This is just a fitness band with full touchscreen control and color display.",2
"No help to install the printer. the CD was missing. We were used to call hardware people to install it and pay for it too.
the cartridge is too small may not last even few printouts.",2
"Performance is good, but hang many times",2
"I bought this watch for tracking steps and workout activities. The watch is amazing at this price point, but the inaccurate step tracker was a bummer :(

The main problem arises when the watch counts over 500-600 steps each time you travel in a vehicle. The steps are synced in myfitnesspal and google fit leading to weird calorie counts.",2
Totally Dippreased from this product because I bought this product 13 days ago but headphone one side speaker is not working,2
Very bad quality...... Mobile phone and charger both of get heat 🔥🔥🔥 an also hanging problem,2
"It’s just not worth the money. I have used MI phones earlier and they work fine but this one is useless.
1) it’s very slow and if you open multiple app at a time the phone will hang
2) Even opening YouTube application on this phone takes close to 8-10 seconds
3) Battery is very and will last appx 1 day with normal usage
4) lot of ads pop up which is irritating
5) Camera is very bad , My earlier MI 5A takes better pictures than this phone

Overall very unhappy with this product.
I have been using this since 10 days now.",2
"Hi,

They say multi-screen display but this is not active with this product. My need was that but after observing its not supported its dis-appointing and but adv says it on amazon page....
Like this many other features are missing. Please be careful on your needs on this costly monitor of 8,899.00Rs.

Also, as per description they say ""1 Headphone Port"" which is not true. Please correct it amazon.

no usb port very big disappointment at this price.

Thanks",2
"Mobile 48mp camera is like a 4mp , very poor quality lance's are mounted on it. I personally recommend don't buy this mobile, choose another brand or model.thank you",2
"Today I received Redmi9 sky Blue , 4GB RAM 64GB Storage phone. But no screen guard & back cover in the phone box.",2
Noisefit app is not getting installed at all since last 5 days very annoying experience. Resolve ASAP,2
"Pros :
Easy to install both in extender mode and modem mode
Good wifi signal
Cons :
Sometimes you need to reset every few weeks
Signal is strong but speed is very slow (I have a 200 Mbps connection , connecting to it gives me 20 Mbps to 30 Mbps max )

Buy it if you dont have budget to get some good routers",2
Redmi 9a like a old phone something,2
Average quality and performance. Overall feedback seems poor in terms of users friendly ui.,2
Not value for money. Cost of ink cartridge is very high. Not recommended to buy.,2
Why do we buy a fitness tracker? To measure exercises and calories burnt right? This Mi Band 5 is not good at all in it. It measures correct step count. But calories count is not correct at all. Most irritating thing is that it tracks steps even when you are riding motorbike or car.,2
The range of the product is not more than 10 meters. Works well within 5 meters and speed drops significantly after that. I don't recommend the product unless you want to keep it on your table.,2
This product is average.,2
"Not much as acpecting and not worth of 4000 ...i think there are better opetion are avalible under this price ...
No feature
Nothing like that as thinking
not happy with product
Dont waste your money",2
Quality is not upto the mark. Microphone got damaged in the warranty period and the warranty process is taking long time. It's more than a month and still waiting for replacement product.,2
Phone will be switched off and on automatic it’s problem,2
"I have ordered the product it got delivered within a day but once i paired with my phone i thought it was working smoothly but then i put for charging there is a problem in band fr getting charged
I returned back",2
Not as expected but I will give it a chance let's see what happen,2
"Sound quality is very dull
Not clear sound
The bass is weak not clear bass subwoofer sound is not defined",2
"If u have the guts to buy cartridge (₹700) for every 10 days then go for it.
I won't say the product is bad but i can suggest that this product is really not for those heavy user.
ONE CARTRIDGE LAST WITH 20 PAPERS.",2
Woofer is a dameg pice not start pls helf to us,2
"When calling someone with this earphone, the other person can not get my voice......",2
"Quality is not good. So fragile and while taking out of head its broken. I bought on Jan 23rd 2021, not even 5 months. I activated the warranty but if I check for replacement In the given number I get service center details. No idea how to get it replaced. Expecting Amazon to help me on this product replacement.",2
I don't think it is a genuine JBL product. The quality of material is really poor. The wire has broken within three months of careful use. And I didn't even use it often. Plus they write 1 year warranty but fail to mention only for technical fault. Don't buy this product.,2
The product really sucks. its not the same as its shown. it keeps disconnecting from the phone. the app also crashes again and again. I dont promote this product at all. dont go for it.,2
I used this phone two and half months this is used only for make normal call only. YouTube video latency is very worst. Normal Video call via dailpad from jio to jio network is video clarity good but audio is very worst more than 15 mins continue video call this phone is overheating and battery quickly drain it's batter than Redmi 4 2GB Ram 16GB Rom model now I use this Redmi mobile.,2
"Outdated Item, poor qualify, good for basic needs, not many options",2
"Wi fi signal strength not
good.",2
Problem which this router signal drops especially for tv... Band with become very less after connecting to two mobiles one laptop and one tv. So better prefer dual band router.,2
There are no major issues with the watch but a big issue with the app. The fitness tracker unbinds itself everyday from the app and it is almost impossible to pair it again without uninstalling the app. Colofit Pro 2 is a total waste of money because tracking down everything on the device sounds good but synchronising it is a tough job. So I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this. I read all the reviews on amazon and bought it and was totally diappointed.,2
music out is very poor but bass is okay i suggest u to not to buy,2
"the battery life was very low despite shutting of all background applications and low brightness.
The screen quality is poor and outdoors difficult to see the screen",2
I really love Mi Band 4 and other Xiaomi products but the supplied charger is faulty. Even after replacement the charger inside the box is faulty. The tracker doesn't stay inside. It pops out. People who ordered from AliExpress don't have this issue. But Indian shipments have this problem. Xiaomi gave me a bad experience for the first time.,2
Camera quality is very worst,2
"Purchased yesterday only but found camera not good,very obscure,low quality.Frequently screen is getting very wide/big.The phone is of bad quality,the device doesn't support for payment,if any possibility I will exchange for other one",2
Mini earphone which is not mentioned while buying. Wire is Very thin. Tend to torn. Not deserving SO much price. SO think twice before buying,2
"This product is very good in respect of Audio Input(speakers) and Output (Mic). With volume + and - buttons in the Headset, you can increase the volume beyond the capacity of the phone, which is Great! The Bass and Treble are unbelievable!

That being said, products like these (with wireless/Bluetooth) technology have a very big flaw in general. The Headsets capability of Auto-connecting to multiple devices is an ""Evil"" in disguise of a blessing. These devices randomly connect to other devices (or keep on trying to, that have Bluetooth in ON/Broadcast state) and create interference with the ""Your"" device and hence there is an issue with frequent disconnections and they randomly disconnect from the Original device they are supposed to remain connected with.
I have experienced this with my own pTRON Tangent lite Headset that I purchased recently, but had to return it back.
My house is amidst two Samsung Smart TVs & one Smartphone (next door neighbors) and the headset keeps on disconnecting from my Smartphone and constantly remains in search of other devices.
Furthermore, there is no way you can restrict your headset, forget restricting, you cannot even disable discovery mode or stop it from further searching; resulting to which you have to Re-connect it to Your device every time it is required to perform its role with YOUR devices - (and who would ask our neighbours to switch off their Bluetooth?!)
In the context of Call Receiving, you will always find the call landing on your Phone instead of the Headset and you have to reach up to the phone to reconnect it - making this device useless.
There are no issues till the time you are talking or listening to music, but the moment you stop, it will disconnect!
The worse part is that it will show the status on the phone as Connected, except that there is no Voice (or sound or music) transfer.
I have read that Headsets at higher price end also have this disability but very less.
Bluetooth Headsets are a new concept (with almost all latest devices having Bluetooth) and thus the Headsets require little bit more configurational options in future.",2
"MyTp-link router automatically disconnects while running. I do not know what may be the reason? It is under warranty. If possible replace me this set with another one.

"Phone is heating very high while charging and calling. We had submit the request on the next day, we had received the phone. But till now, phone is not picked up and amount is not refunded.",2
Not properly functioning and not worthy at this prize.,2
"After 1month of usage:
Battery suddenly drops from 100% to 40%, heating issue while in call. I will Not recommend this phone. Just Go for midrange mobiles above 8000rs.",2
The headphones are kinda good in terms of the audio quality and battery backup.......but the build and the quality of the headphones is not that great as the ones which I ordered broke like shown in the photo and this happened very close to the time I actually ordered it and started using it........I used the headphones as I would have used any other headphones but the headphones just came apart🤷🏽‍♂️,2
catrige price is most expensive,2

It not at all good for gameing . It has a very poor noise cancellation fataliti . After few weeks it just broke by stretching when I was wereing it for use poor quality if you are buying it is only good for less use or it will start creating problem it has an average sound quality.it is not good for meeting ,classes, gameing very bad quality recommended not to buy this product is very bad no noise cancellation facility very bad build quality so you should not buy this product .very bad product this by stretching it breaks so build quality is very bad it does not has an noise cancellation facility and this auxillary works not very well so I recommend not to buy this product",2

Total waste of money.
150Mbps and 300 Mbps are same than why to buy 300Mbps tp link router",2
Mic stops working just after 3 months...either it will fully stopped or voice through mic will be very low.,2
Issue is over heeting while using continuously more than 1hr. Charge getting down fastly. Totally no satisfaction with purchase of this mobile.,2
2000page ke bad hi ek line ata hai,2
"Everything was fine under this budget, bu the loudspeaker got damaged (scratching sound) within a week. There's no replacement too.

Not recommended..!!!",2
It's just a noral type of printer and his printer quality are ok ok type.,2

"At this price Product quality not good. Bluetooth range not more than 10/12 foot. Wears are very thin.no oncoming call voice notification.no bass in sound.after 6 month
Battery is not working.",2
Hangs after 10 days of use even when there is no game apps.. Idiotic of me to buy it..,2
"I got it on first sale but got a defective piece. The band was little tilted by shape (pics attached for ref). Immediately I did place req for replacement and it was accepted without any issue. And, I got one on 3rd day. Coming to band my main intention was to get notifications and call alert. I am getting call, sms, whatsapp, email, instagram, Google weather update without any flaws. When I received the battery was 39% and eod I have 19%. I get lot of notification and assuming this I may get 4-5 days for which I'm happy.",2
According to features the quality is null.,2
"Doesn't properly with win 10 hanging issues with this os
I m used linux os better work then win 10 os
No hanging issues with linux os",2
the most dislike feature of the watch is it doesnot gives you a proper notifications,2
Ok product not that great.,2
"Wifi signal is very poor, cant reach to even the next room",2
It short circuited in just in 4 months. Better buy a branded monitor.,2
Signal power not that great. My old Mi 3C has better signal strength.,2
"I had D-Link D-615 N300 which has better range than this TPLink Archer C6 AC1200. However it offers both 5GHz and 2.4GHz speeds as promised and I am totally satisfied with short ranges but from 1 room to other ( btw, I live in small house in Chennai and total range between rooms is <500SFT) it really doesn't work. Too bad I thought this is the one for me, but would keep it for future purposes.",2
Display is worse. Very much unlike Samsung. I thought the first product had some display issues so I returned and got another one. But display itself is made like that,2
The product is good but installing it is a big headache. I tried for several times and after failing I had to call up a technician for the job. On previous occasions I had installed WIFI routers without a headache.,2
Very Poor range .,2
The most important feature of reminders is missing from the watch.,2
Doesn’t cover even 10 meters ! No point buying this .. I am not satisfied at all,2
"good modem, but poor power supply.
Also make sure to get the latest hardware version V1 with usb support and latest firmware. i got duped by speed with h/w version A1 !",2

I won't recommend to buy this one.",2
Sound quality is just terrible. Can't listen to music with this home theatre.😡😡,2
Range is very very poor. I bought the one with 5 antenna which is wonderful but this one is quite bad. Just works if u r in same room otherwise quite bad,2
I am a huge fan of Xiaomi and hence ordered this Power9. But got disappointed with the performance of camera. Photo clarity is very poor in day light also and with 48MP as well. Never expected this from Xiaomi. Phone also lags a at times. Huge Dissapointment.,2
The sync function is defaulty....hard to sync with phone...so giving false reading,2
I doesn't connect to the Wi-Fi router. You have to access it through AP mode. That mean you've to disconnect from the main wifi. And print quality is also not satisfactory.,2
Very costly to use,2
I did not find good quality in printing. And ink consumption is very high not sure how does company claims those numbers..,2
Not perfect,2
Product is good but the charger is two pin charger and always is unstable. Why didn't the company think of providing a 3 pin charger?,2
"Don't buy Samsung with exynos processors

1 lag
2 ghost touch.",2
"Build Quality is Good,
Connectivity is Good
But the Sound Output is not good at all.
Bass is very less, and i got defective product where earphone was playing music but at unequal volumes right earpiece had vocals clear and less background music where as left earpiece had more background music and very low or no vocals at all.

WhatsApp Calling not Good
Normal Calling was Good, mic was clear and loud with no complaints

Pubg Game was having some latency

I will recommend only to those who want to have calls over bluetooth and not to those who want to listen music

All the test was done on Redmi Note 5 pro
Returned the product",2

The quality of the hardware and software is not good...i also have an apple watch but the quality of gts 2mini is not even 10% of it...not even good according to price point as there are very much better options available....i would prefer honor watch es over it...there are software glitches and the display was going off repeatedly after removing from the charging dock....the display is very good though....but felt like the amount paid was only for the display...,2
"If one is purchasing this to improve signal strength in multistorey house then not recommended. I tried placing router almost every location of my house but it's signal strength gets lower to 40% which is unreliable.
The 5Gz I thought would be more helpful for me to stream but it's too weak, 2Gz works better than 5.

The reason I didn't returned is the App, ease of configuration, the stunning look .",2
quality doesnt come cheap ! wires came off its shield ! quality ( 0 ),2
USB port is not there... but it was specified in features....,2
"If i ignore looks, i won't buy the product. It doesn't have proper app notification. Heart rate accuracy is bad, calculate BPM even when you are not wearing it. If it had a refund option, would have returned it.

Good things:
1. Look and feels (Very Premium)
2. Monitoring (Okay, not satisfactory)

Cons: (Long list)
1. Doesn't support notifications from Gmail app, Whatsapp business and more
2. Heart rate measuring accuracy
3. Watch faces

For the company
Include some important features and notification in the update. Make it more useful other just just tracking. Just tracking doesn't make it worth, make it a smart watch not just tracker.",2
Just ok not so impresssive,2
"Product not good
Hang the mobile

"It was nice but it stopped working within
7 days ....😨 It was not working in the right side one",2
The Watch design is good.But the OS is full of bugs and stuck sometimes and the watch faces are only limited so better go for best smartwatch at this price.I returned it too👍,2
Its model image shows wan/lan port but it does not have any wan port. its waste of time to book this and return,2
These 2 devices were temporarily (10% of the time) unable to detect the required wi-fi network on which they had worked before. All possibilities were attempted then. But they would just not pick up the network even from a close range and on some occasions even after resetting the devices. 2 other devices were fine. Time for warranty.at least!!,2
It did not even work properly for 2 months. I would not prefer to buy this again. Its just waste of money.,2
Looks and sound quality is good but sometimes connectivity get disrupted and now charging problem is also happens. Now headphone is now taking charge I don’t know what happened in it. And one more issue while talking over call calling sensor is not working. But wired connectivity is good.,2

I purchased this power bank by seeing r views posted. Within 10 days power bank has stopped charging and is not providing back up for my router,2
Think 100 times before buying it. It looks attractive but display and built quality are very cheap. Not worth the money spent. Mi band 4 has better display quality than this watch. Applied for return after one hr of purchase.,2

Horrible ram management, can't even hold two apps at once. Buy this of you are getting it at 6k range, this phone is not worth more than that. All this and adding the worst delivery experience form amazon delivery.",2

Tried to contact phone number support, none is picking the call.

Bleeding issue,2
Very basic phone don't get fooled ... performance is very average or below average... The app icons comes so big ..feels like it's made for elderly people...no fast charging for a battery 4300 mah...very dissatisfied with the service from Amazon..there is no return policy as well..now stuck with this product ...,2
It's not useful for use for a long time it's cution is very hard which will give a lot of pain to ears so don't buy this product.,2
I used it only 4 or 5 times till now and it’s not working properly.i was thinking that it might be setting problem but no it’s not a setting problem when I press the click button it stuck and on the screen it always show busy or error. I got frustrated when I pick it up for clicking pictures. With this problem first I have to switched it off and then on then it work only for 1 click after it again it show busy and the click button not work even I m not able to press it . It gets jam all the time.kindly do the needful bcz it’s in still warranty.,2
They keep falling off from the ears. If you try to fix them tight then there is a risk of the silicone plug remaining in your ear.,2
Please don't buy this product..printing is dammed slow and photo printing worst..I don't recommend,2
Really disliked the sync with app. It's a good looking watch but definitely not a smartwatch. It is so painful to connect watch to the app. Keep trying all day but just doesn't happen. One has to reset the watch every now and then and tey to connect. Thereafter too success is not guaranteed. And no way to connect with support to solve the matter,2
So an so,2
Bass good sound quality okay,2
"Battery won't last more than 4 days, battery charging is fast. Watch dosent have memory, if I synch the data, app wipes out all previous records. The App is not good, I lost all the data, need to sync activities daily to app. Even after that app fails to store data.",2
"The charging part came out, the part totally broke and the wire got torn!! Though i handle it carefully it somehow broke. am not satisfied.",2
Worst watch,2
I have received the printer on time but during setup it is observed that Paper Input is not getting opened. I have made the complaint to HP. I also request to amazon to take up the matter with HP for attending the problem at the earliest.,2
Product is below expectation. BP readings are not accurate.,2
I bought these ear phones on January 7th. Worked fine for 10 days and later problem started that people were not able to hear my voice when i'm speaking through these earphones. Its completely waste of money and can't return the product also as its already crossed 15 days of return time.,2

Frequent connection loss and sometimes disconnect itself and the wifi signal are mot strong...,2
Don't go for it.,2

You can checkout ink tank printer.
Inktank printer is good choice.",2
Very bad camera quality. Though RAM is 4GB but performance of Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 is too good (3GB ram). Battery backup is not too good. Very bad picture quality during video call. Not satisfied,2
"Pic 1 - Outdoor cycling - The path shown in the image is actually the opposite to the direction in which I performed the activity. Distance shown is lesser than actual distance covered. Even more, it actually started tracking distance after I'd already covered 2+ kms. (I already synced with Mi Fit App, Switched my GPS on, and locked the application).

Pic 2 - After waking up, going to cycling directly and coming back, it should have been maximum 150 steps. But it shows 850+. Also, just after waking up it shows some 100+ steps. (lol)

I am really disappointed with the product, even though it as some good pros like
- amazing battery life (after like 4-5 days it's on 82% charge)
- sleep tracking (the only thing which is nearly accurate)
- good touch sensitivity and display
- mi fit app is OK
- water resistance

Other cons -
- inaccurate heart rate
- inaccurate stress monitoring

The main selling point of any ""smart"" band/watch is the fitness features it provides. I don't want a good battery life or screen but provide me accurate informations. Inaccurate gps tracking, calorie tracking, steps tracking, heart rate tracking is enough for me to give it 2/5.",2
"Performance is too bad.. print and scan is too slow... By the time it scan one paper, i can scan 3 papers using mobile app... Printer is made with plastic and I feel i need to be more cautious in handling it... Did a big mistake by selecting this printer... No issues from Amazon delivery point of view...",2

It's a simple router with no frills. Even though it has 3 attenae the signal is not very strong. The support drivers are the same and not updated since install.

Leaving this apart the product can be given 3.5/5.",2

"Previously was using td-w8968 model for the past two years. there was some short circuit and went off. Am not a specialist in the filed. When one buys a later product of the same model, one expects that it would have all the features of the earlier product plus some additions. Very disappointed to find that this product can be used only for ADSL and not on cable network internet. This the Company should have explicitly mentioned in the product description so that non technical persons would not fall prey. My father is 63 years old, a senior citizen, and had to go all the way to the service centre at Mumbai to find out the harsh reality. Precious time and lot of effort. Now am returning the product since it is not useful.
The guys at the service centre were helpful in finding out the plight of my dad. But nothing more.",2
No doubt the sound quality was good. However not durable doesn't last more than 5 months. Tried checking for replacement but it was denied stating out of warranty but the product comes with one year warranty. Don't buy if you are looking for product that will last long.,2

Tried calling customer care or their dealers in Jaipur , unfortunately no response ! Was good until was working ! Not worth the money if your looking for talking Perspective. The mic is absolutely rubbish the other party can hear all the other background noises !",2
Low Bass experience,2

What a phone is this I thought Samsung would be good but it has its low quality battery late charges and fast consumed and now the other big problem that it is switching off even being cahrged during using it. And one more thing that I did not get the injection pin in the package. This is very disappointing to me.,2
Though the smart watch seems value for money but it has pathetic user application and warranty registration process.,2
"I, as a connoisseur, do not like too much of bass boosting. Normal about 135 Hz bass for this system is fine as per human audible bass. Treble could have been better. But you cannot tell in details unless you play for some days to stabilize speaker magnate which improves with use.
Use after some days shows lack of clarity. Not a great one. I should have preferred local assembled as available in this web or a other Chinese ones. ( this is no doubt assembled in China).

Cons: The remote is not as smooth expected.",2
I have made a big mistake to purchase this product . It's flash is not working during video call and pen drive is not supported also in this redmi 9 cellphone .,2
"Even though in medium volume the woofer makes Humming noise which causes much disturbance.
There is no display to show the level if volume, bass etc.

"Good Monitor for 1080p gaming under 10k. I am using this with my MacBook Pro 2016. Unfortunately this is recognised as a TV via HDMI so the display doesn't look as good as it should, especially when it comes to colour profiles. I'd look for a display with Displayport if you want to use it with a Mac. This way its recognised as an external display and not a TV. I've had this issue with 2012 rMBP too when connected to a Dell 23 inch display with HDMI. But this one is definitely better than that. One other issue is that the display wobbles. Yes its got some wobble to it which can get annoying sometimes. For gaming it'll get 5 stars. For work 3 starts. So overall 4 starts.

Note : Purchased from local seller that offered better price than Amazon surprisingly.

Update : This monitor may not support HDCP necessary for Netflix. Netflix in edge or windows 10 app will not play above 720p. I have an 8th Gen PC and connected via HDMI cable so technically there should be no problem for Netflix content, however I believe there seems to be HDCP incompatibility issues. I have tried all troubleshooting but this will not play 1080p Netflix. Even connecting a streaming stick which should technically work 100% without any problem. Still no luck. Updated review accordingly.",2
"Good sound quality but after 2 months it stopped working from one side. I have purchased 2 piece one is working fine.

Yes if you are reading this review please don't buy or you will definitely Regret it.
It only has a good looking design everything else is not even as good Chinese earphones which you could buy for rs 100 or even less.
Sound quality is below average.
Bass is also not up to the mark.
Its earbuds are though they are made up of plastic ( quite a hard and uncomfortable ).
It's quite a disappointment overall.",2

"If you are just looking a Apple look alike smart watch then go for it, but if you are hoping for fitness band along with what a good smartwatch can do then please there are better products in market.

Reviewing this after 4 weeks of use and using it for my workouts:
Fitness:: I am over weight and not a workout person. Bought this so I can feel motivated once I join gym. The watch tracks your heartbeat and steps well but that’s it. It is unable to track whether you are working out or not. The calorie count only works for the steps taken. The app is never synced with the watch and won’t show data what your watch tracks.

Touchscreen: The LCD screen of the watch will take you back in time when pixelated images and icons were the standard. The touch is not very responsive but does the work 70% of the time.

Screen: The screen has got Bazels which is not visible in the picture.

Overall a very mediocre product",2
"Not as expected
Bass quality not good.
No Equaliser settings option.
Bluetooth function is good",2

"Horrible phone with worst camera and extremely slow processor.don't but,total waste of money .totally disappointed , never buy this phone",2
All thr reviews about wifi range are true. 4 anteanas looks like a show off. I was using tplink wr720n with single antena and that seems to perform way better then this. I looked at 4 antenas and thought signal strength and rangle would be better but it was not and at times bit low as compare to tplink router with single antena.,2
Worst camera quality,2

"This product is good in general, but if you are a user who is accustomed to high pixel density display, then you will not like the display you get here.
I have raised a return request. The pickup person arrived on the pickup day, and told me he is carrying 2 pickup receipts and will not be able to accept the item unless he scans two barcodes for the two items to be picked. I was surprised, as I was returning only one item. He suggested to cancel the return request and raise another one. Following this I spoke with a customer care agent, who said he has raise another return request, and the previous problem could be a technical issue. Such glitches are not expected from a technically strong company like Amazon.",2
"Product is not packed in proper way, Box seal is open before receiving, little defect in headphone.",2
Total waste of money..exact opposite of the company's name..just stop working in one month..like that 100rs leads were more workable than this..,2
"It is an average product even though I wan't expecting much from it anyways at this price. Out of the box, the biggest annoyance is the extremely short wires for the satellite speakers. And every time you turn it off, the volume that you've set with the remote resets to max. There's no fabric or net covering for the diaphragms, so you'll have to ensure that they're kept clean. There's no equalizer of any sort - the remote is just for volume, changing input source, and On/Standby.
And like other users warned, after just a few weeks of use, the woofer has started hissing and popping even when it is on standby. As long as it gets electricity, it happens, and it rapidly becomes annoying. I can't return mine because I've already cut and spliced longer speaker wires.
On the plus side, it is decently loud for a small apartment and even gives some sort of a surround sound vibe. I haven't used any other input methods other than PC, but others should appreciate the Bluetooth and USB/SD Card inputs",2
"Headphone build quality is good. Light weight and very Comfortable to wear for long time. Easy to connect and sound quality is excellent.
Only con is when connected to laptop through bluetooth, mic is not working.

After 4 days of usage,
1. YouTube audio is cracking, cross checked with my old headphone.. no problem with that.
2. Cannot use this headphone for Calls. Mic is really low, people on other side of the calls not able to hear me. Fire Boltt should atleast provide aux cable with mic.
3. Connectivity is getting degraded, 1st n 2nd day no problem, but on 3rd day onwards ""kaarrr"" sound coming even when my phone is placed in front of me.

So downgraded rating to 2stars n returned the headphone.",2
Not working anymore .. giving less speed no issues with internet provider,2
It was not satisfied. Bass was not good as specified.,2
Vest product only 25 days used so many problems west product,2
"Upgraded from 2 year older DIR600M and was expecting better performance. This has a slightly higher signal strength and support mutiple devices better (mutiple laptop for WFH).
Main problem is the wifi drops intermittently under load. Even the wifi indicator light on the router gets switched off and starts about 10-20 seconds later. No error in the router log
This happens more on warm days (temperature reaching 30 or more) indicating that the router is not suitable for warm country like ours but more for the product originating country (China).
This would be my last purchase of D Link after this experience.

And Yes it is made in China.",2
I am using it from 2 Month's it is not working properly now wifi signal has become slow.,2
"This router looks good from outside with stylish design and triple antennas but it's wifi signal is too bad.. It can't even cover 150 sq ft room properly
So don't buy it and regret later. I prefer better go for DILINK DIR-615L. awesome wifi coverage",2
"Not an original product. The audio jack slowly becomes deteriorated and one earpiece stops working. JBL down not even reply properly to warranty claim emails or calls and it's been over a month now, no reply",2
The watch is automatically getting power off repeatedly..i replace the watch but the issue not solved,2
"Worse product, No support when warranty is over. U hv to throw it in dustbin. Worst support. .. .. .",2
"The product is good in term of sound quality considering the price at which it was purchased. But the workmanship of the product is extremely poor. With in a week of purchase, the ear muffs were in my hands and i was asked to visit ZEBRONICS service centre to get it fixed, in COVID situation, i did not visit the centre, muff is still not fixed. A typical ZEBRONICS product.",2
Oxymetre is not showing on screen.,2
Not working fast.,2
I liked the product for its price. But the product stopped working in the warranty period. The ptron India website was not responsive to calls and emails. I had to email ptron.hk website.,2
Printing quality is good but the cartiges get finished in 6 pages and are very expensive and i am not stisfy withvthe printer,2
"After using band for 1 month I have found 2 issues:
1) Band's glass got cracked without any major collision
2) After removing band sometimes it's sensor emits green color light continuously.",2
Product Delivered is cheap and different from what is shown here. Not worth of purchasing here.,2
"Synthetic material (instead of cotton) used around speakers make it uncomfortable to put on for long hours especially in hot weather, it sweats and feels warm around ears. One should avoid all headsets which use synthetic material instead of cotton.",2
"Sound is good, Bluetooth connectivity is also not very bad but the main problem I'm facing is its voice over call. When I call someone second person is not able to hear me loud and proper but very less voice reached the second person.",2
Mic not working after 1 month. Sound quality is not much good.,2
"Once I setup this router it was pretty good and I loved it.

However the issue started after a month of usage that the WiFi signals (both 2.4 and 5Ghz bands) will disconnect very frequently. I have checked online and this is a known issue with this model. I would have searched online about its flaws before the purchase itself. I have checked this amazon reviews as well and if I scoll through many comments I understand that it's the issue with most of the ppl. I have Act Fiber 150Mbps connection and in order for me to get 100Mbps over Wifi 5Ghz band,I have to keep changing the channel EVERYTIME I use.

There is no customer care for this and if we go to website they always say No agents available for chat and other modes don't work properly. So now I'm left with the defected model with a loss of 2.3K

If you really have so much of patience to change the WiFi channel before usage (maybe every 30 mins), u can go for it. Else u have similar specifications in other brands within same price point.

Note: if u are reading this review, My suggestion would be just search for the flaws of this model in Google and also other sources if you have before purchasing.",2
the product came with the box squished and once i tried on the earphones the right one wasnt as loud as the right one. I was always a jbl customer but buying these let me down,2
"Very low ppm (3 or 4ppm) as shown in details (33ppm) for black colour. Paper jamming problem again and again. print, scan directly by mobile or laptop or PC. Good Print quality. I don't recommend this printer because of very low speed printing.",2
this product broked very easily like when i buyed it after 15-20 days the right side band is cracking little bit then afterwards it fully cracked the build quality is very poor but product is awesome due to build quality i wont recommend you to buy it,2
I purchased this twice (audio quality is good) and got same issue of mic being able not to work after around 15 days of purchase and not able to return it now.,2
The product is nyc but one side of the ear phone didn't work after 1 month and went to the store and changed but I didn't get the same color but ok that I got another one,2

"Brought this mobile for friend & Writing this review after 1 month of it use, Mobile is not at all good. poor camera quality, imbalance system settings. Few hours of continuous use lead to device heat up",2
"Well Firstly i brought this... then I realised the network coverage of this router is verry low...
And also the speed is slower..
So i returned..

If you live in a 2bhk or 3bhk flat then its ok... in sense of coverage...but if you live in a house that has multiple floors then this thing sucks...

If you have a connection more than 25 mbps then dont go for this.. it will not provide more than 15..

Its better to go for dual band routers that will come almost of the same price range...
I got one at Rs.1500... and it works fine..

Hope this review will be helpful 🙃🙂",2
"Please don't expect a good range(by seeing 4 antennas you may expect) just good for one room with a 2mbps speed.

Else everything okay.",2
"I feel personally after comparison with redmi note 7 camera quality is much better compare to note 9.

"Had great hopes of this but as fate would have it I was disappointed. To begin with the bluetooth would not function, all else was fine. I decided to return it and got it replaced. Now this second one has a different kind of problem. From outside on can see evidence of severe impact in the bottom corner.. still hoped that it will work as expected. But it was not to be, even at mid volumes the bass makes an awful lot of noise spoiling the party. So am going to return it and may be go for some other brand.",2
"After 3 months of usage, backup is not lasting even 30 mins now",2

"The HP Deskjet 2131 printer is really good. But when it comes to cartridges (HP 803), it is found to be too costly. The printer costs a little over Rs3200 whereas the cartridges cost over Rs1700. Considering that a set of cartridges produce hardly 100-110 quality prints (HP claims 1000 pages, but I never got), this printer is not cost-effective overall.",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The product is not much efficient I recommy u to buy another product money waste",2
"Sound quality is ok considering the price
Volume up/down controls(long press) are disturbing as that are overlapped with the next/previous buttons(short press), not exactly a complete hands free experience, because more often than not you'll change the song while decreasing or increasing volume midway, so i suggest its best to use phone volume keys
I'll update any further review with further usage.
P.S. too much clunky, very uncomfortable to use. You can't carry it around while traveling as turning your neck becomes a problem. After using for 30mins, discomfort occurs due to heavy weight.",2
Don't waste Ur money buying this useless watch. It has pairing issue all the time & U can't even reject Calls in watch notification,2
Very ordinary phone,2

"Mobile speaker is not powerful, mic is poor. Overall it is chip quality. Please go through oppo,vivo, Samsung which are really standard.",2
"It is not working, power supply is not shown. I want to replace.",2
"Beautiful product with some flaws in execution.

I have browsed several reddit forums and samsung members community app only to find that issues around display are recurring in this device.

1. Ghost touches - this I didn't face. Some people had reported that screen takes touch inputs on its own.

2. Brightness banding - this is what happens when you are looking at a phone in a dark room (like I did before sleeping, scrolling through social media). If a background is grey, it is very uneven, with some portions of screen dimly lit and others brightly lit. It becomes very irritating since we use dark mode to conserve battery. Whatsapp looked brighter in the upper half, so did chrome when all tabs were closed and any grey/greyish tone for that matter didn't look perfect. What's worse is that samsung in India says this is a characteristic of the display and therefore, it cannot be repaired/replaced. I saw enough red flags and just returned it within 7 day window to get full refund. You can refer to the first pic, this is how my display was. Search on google - ""Samsung S20 FE banding"" to see more such cases.

3. Green tint - again related to grey background in a dark room with low brightness, where grey can look green. I have uploaded this, refer to 2nd image. Not my unit but someone received it with that issue.
Search on google - ""Samsung S20 FE Green Tint"" to see more such cases.

While the device offers a lot at such a compelling price, it's futile if faulty units in large quantities have been manufactured. Sours the user experience - samsung giving a snapdragon phone in India was the only reason I bought it, and now had to return an otherwise perfect device marred with display issues.",2

I don't expect this type of product . Sound is very low. Brightness is always high no matter you lower it. People like me who spend more time on monitor and wear specs. Don't go for it.,2

After two more days they send me a RMA # and ask me to ship the product to them at my expense. Sent. waiting for my luck to get a replacement now.

But the earphone are of subpar quality, talking on the phone is a pain because you have to hold the mouthpiece up and talk which defeats the whole purpose of having it, the sound quality on these is also not as good as the other earphones from this brand.

"I purchased this product in 2017 and it was working well at the beginning and the backup would somewhere last around 3 to 4 hours so I was happy with it. After 18 months or so the backup from this UPS now lasts less than a minute and is of no use. I contacted Resonate customer care to see if my device can be repaired but sadly they stated that the batteries cannot be replaced/repaired and I need to buy a new one instead. I also believe that this is the case with several other users. So, I'm really concerned about two things: 1. You will need to buy a new Resonate UPS router every ~18 months 2. What a waste of resources. Please consider repairing/replacing the batteries else they would end up in landfills. Please think wise and save our mother earth.",2
Damaged when I received. Nd also no exchange on it.,2
"Initially after using the product for month it started giving problems, most of the times you won't be able to listen clear sound in one of the headfones (Left/Right) which is really irritating. I will not recommend this product to anyone.",2
After firmware update 1 laptop is not connecting to router. Felt the firmware update has not been properly developed and tested,2
Not so good useless product.,2
"Updated phone with outdated features,
Oppo & vivo are far better...,
U will get app updates only if u open app...,
Just tempted by seeing Samsung brand & battery capacity",2
"Although it's excellent sound quality and feels like value for money at first glance, please be wary that the headphones sit very tight - ears feel the pain of the grip. It's also not a one size fits all. There is room to adjust for various head sizes but it's still loose for me at the top! Last, if you're looking for a headset cum headphone, the headset feature stopped working for me in 3 months. I can't use this for my phone and work calls anymore.
Apart from that, the sound quality is really good and there are no problems with headphones other than the above.",2
"It gives wrong counting of steps, if you are not walking and moving your hands on chairs it count them as steps,
Sleep tracking works fine.
Data syncing with app is worst feature u will see, it doesn't tell speed while cycling or will tell u wrong results like having avg speed more than max speed also it gets paused even if u are running and cycling so it irritates me everytime i have to resume it.
Battery very good - almost used it for 10 days witbout charge having daily morning and evening exercise routine.
Display is nice and smooth.",2
i got 1 phone cable and 1 LAN cable.i had 2 buy another cable 4 splitter 2 connect 2 phone. inside packaging was not good.looked like product was returned b4.works fine though.low rating is 4 missing cable only.,2

Not for music lovers
Good battery life",2

"Does not support speed above 100Mbps even if the internet plan taken is higher, false marketing that it supports 1200Mbps",2
"Easy to Install. Print Quality is Okay for this Price. I Bought at Rs.2899, but Cartridge Price is very Costly. Colour Print is Very Good.
But Printer Ink Cartridge is Very Costly. Go to Epson Printer it's Economical.",2
"Looking good and also other functions good which they mentioned. But but BATTERY LIFE MAXIMUM THREE DAYS and other big issue DISCONNECTING PROBLEM WITH APPLICATION. And disconnect maximum when i open any application (eg. when I open youtube, in one minute it disconnect approx 5-6 times, u will fill ur hand is vibranting continuously, feeling irritating)
Think before buy because u can only replace not return(I am regretting😒😔)",2
It's sound quality is super. I like it. After some days right side stereo is not working👎,2
Camera quality is very ancient.selfie camera and back camera resolutions are very bad bad bad.. pics are getting grained.,2
Whatsapp video calling is very bad,2
One of the worst products I have bought. It's internet connectivity keeps on dropping from time to time. the internet speed keeps on fluctuating by 50mbps. I had a D-Link single antenna and it was giving much more coverage with uniform speed. Its a complete show off for a product because those 4 antennas are of no use what so ever. Good Day!!,2
"Idk is it individual product defect or what but after 4-5 days use these ear buds voice becomes Just so low.
And there was no latency from starting only in playing games
It means u can't play games with this
Just requested a replacement let's see what happens next.",2
Sometimes he'll be make a lot of noise.,2
I like its software and all but range is not that good if you have bigger house. Would recommend other router of you want greater range.,2
The phone has stopped working completely. I had gifted this to my grand mother. And now it just stopped working suddenly. Honest Review after a year.,2
"Product is stylish, packing was good but the camera quality is very bad (both the selfie and back camera)Not worth saying it is 48 MP camera.Front camera is worst with granulated photos.It sometimes hangs.
But charging speed ,net speed and processing speed is fast.There are new security features and certain applications are good .",2
"WiFi signals are weak.. Even a ₹700 tiny Tenda router gives you same range.

5Ghz signals are weaker than 2.4Ghz. Big size and 4 antennas actually create problems to fit it on a wall.

I don't think the cost is justified. No USB port for sharing storage.",2
I used this product to extend my wifi signal. It failed miserably. The customer service on Amazon was very good but TP-link customer service was pathetic. They have not refunded or initaited any sort of conversation on their end. I only got 93 MBPS whereas the I get 300 MBPS on my 5GHZ connection. Too much loss of signal. Misleading product.,2
Don't buy it!!!,2
"Remote not working
Pls change it",2
"Not a good quality the right hear head phone stopped working in 3 months.
Try any other one.",2
"camera quality was not so good, power button is very hard",2
Look is good and sound is good but paining is there when u use it more than a min,2
"The packaging and delivery was very good but after 4 days of minimal usage, I started facing issues of connection drops. Also, for a 2BHK, you will receive a so-so network strength. The strength reduces drastically in those areas, where you are covered by 2 walls.",2
The sound quality is average as there is too much of base and no treble but then you can’t expect much at a price which is literally a steal .The newer earphones from the same company have more bass and thump and the clarity of sound is well calibrated.The ergonomics is quite well distributed with its sleek design and style.Overall it’s an average buy and if are that person looking for sound and bass this particular model might not suit your needs but the alternative models could help the cause,2
"As it has always been with any of the jbls I ever had...this too stood up to the same expectations. The earphones in terms of music quality, premium and decent asthetics are good, that's what you expect from such a brand. But when it comes to the durability of the earphones, JBL has always turned me down with the poor durability of its earphones. This right earphone malfunctioned withing 3.5 months n similarly the right one too went off within 7-10 days. I love the music quality but hate when I have to replace it within 3-4 months. It's very irritating. JBL lacks durability. N this time I m not going for a JBL. Coz it's enough now.",2
WiFi signal covers very short.,2
"User interface is good, but the product uses SMB 1.0 which sucks. THere is little to bad security since there is not updates for firmware vulnerabilities nor any updates for softwares. The router randomly reboots on continous usage which is really bad. My old Tenda and Cisco 900 router is much more stable than this.",2
"Not full HD as described. Only 1280 x 800, 720p.",2
"I got the product around Rs.6000 and its always fine. But for the offer they given, is for without earphone. I am very much disappointed without received the earphones.",2
"Pro: Good display, strap and touch
Cons: No GPS, measure failed most of time while measuring heart beat and spo2.",2
Worst product do not buy it,2
Very bad as the bass is not adjustable and also the volume is too low,2
Good.,2
Not best for connections speed less than 100mbps,2
Purchased from MI website.. Wifi signal strength is very poor. 4 antenna are of no use. Better go for TP link or D Link. Singal very poor.,2
HIGH COST,2
Password not set as per description,2
Battery last long for only 48 hours only,2
"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS EAR PHONE, THIS IS WASTE OF MONEY, OVER A USE OF ONLY 6 MONTHS ONE SIDE EAR PHONE GETS OFF AUTOMATICALLY, VERY THIRD CLASS PRODUCT, NOT EXPECTED THIS FROM JBL.",2
DID NOT LOST LONG - IN 1 MONTH IT WENT AWAY - POWER SECTION GONE - I HAVE WASTED 1500/ ON THIS. I COULD HAVE BOUGHT A REGULAR UPS FOR THIS PRICE,2
Not so pleasing,2
"I brought this printer to print occasionally for my child's school work. However after few days when I gave a print, the pages came blank. Logged a service request and was attended by an Epson professional. Apparently since I had not printed for around 10 days, the ink went back into the tanks from the print heads and created a vacuum because of which it was printing empty pages. The issue has come in again now inspite of printing every 3-4days. Totally frustrated with this printer and would recommend only if you will print every 3 days atleast",2
It's battery life okay,2

"Worst phone. Waste of money. In writing this review after using the phone for 3 months.
If the phone is switched on it is getting heat like something. Also you get a message stating phone is over heated.
And battery is not at all get fully charged, only up to 74% it is getting charged not at reaching 100% and that 75% charge will vanish in another 3 hours even if your mobile data and wife is off.
Not at all suggestable.",2
This Printer Ink Cartridge you can't refill. You need to purchase again this. This cost around 800 rs. So the paper print coast is 6 rs per one paper. Don't tempt buy looking hat Printer prices. I already lost money and deceived been,2
Bass is not as much as is claimed....rather noise cancellation is poor when u get sound up a notch....i guess JBL t250si would be better headphone at the same price range.,2
Sound is ok but this is so heavy after some time time you are going to feel pain,2
we want to return it and ordered new one.,2
"The wrist band is awaful..Their is no pin which can enter the holes and fix the band in the wrist..Their is a round leather roundel which has to get strapped in the other side. Since it does not hold , it slides back on the strap thus making it combursome to strap",2
"Hi Team, I haven't heard anything about the replacement of the product from the seller or Amazon...! What is the solution for this.

The product stops working since yesterday 30th September. It's just 75 days only after purchase.
Suddenly I got wifi disconnection from the device and now totally it's switched off. No power supply as well.
Kindly replace the device on an urgent basis.",2
cartiz is not good,2
"Horrible product. The app sucks and step count is beyond inaccurate. It doesn't count steps when disconnected from the app which happens more frequently than you realize. Amazfit is easy to use, go for it. India should ban noise products. All reviews on this have been misleading.",2

Ink cartridges for this very high price .
Better to buy other make.",2
"This watch is only for show off purpose.
Heart rate accuracy 60-80% based on how tight you ware it.
SpO2: it will fail 8 times out of 10 times. Got 2 measurements which is 92 & 94 which is not reliable at all whereas 700 rupees oxymeter shows 98-99%.

Looks & build quality : 7/10
Heart rate accuracy : 60% 5/10
SpO2 accurecy : 1/10 it will fail 8 times out of 10
Step counter accuracy : 8/10 good for active counts.
Sleep tracking : 6/10 since I see heart rate data is inaccurate.
App features: 6/10 takes time to pair and sync. Takes lot of time for updates over the internet.

Overall I can say this is for show off purpose only. No actual use of the features. If you really want to track health then go for MI band or something cheap which count steps properly. It will give same performance as this one. I feels like I have wasted my money.",2
I have been using this watch for 2 weeks now. It is turning off now and then automatically. Shows low battery within 2 days of complete charge. Not worth it for the money paid. So many features are not available. check the features list thoroughly before buying,2
Phone is hanging a lot I'm not able to used any application and I have registered with prime but my prime account is not yet activitied,2
Good Looking...but it calculate your steps while you were traveling in car....which is not good..... plz do something by updating and fix this.....heart rate monitoring is also not accurate....,2

"The earphones are no doubt very good but I did not get any earpieces along with this. Moreover the left ear piece and right were of different size. The product says that it gives a variation of 3 sizes of earpiece, I didn't recieve anything except the one that was already on the earphones.",2
The product is not as good as the price is. It is not worth the money you pay.,2
"Only for music listening not at all recommended for taking calls while you can hear crisp clear but mic is pathetic and everyone keeps complaining, voice is low, not clear it's mixing up etc etc. Battery backup is good and lasts for 6+ hours once charged. User friendly? I will keep it low as it's quite difficult to know how much charge is available at a point. The charging box just has a small dim led which hardly tells you anything. If it's blinking take it as charging and if static, completely charged. I don't know how people are recommending it so much here for voice calls and wfh uses, I had to love back to wired headphones ☹️",2
"Don't know whether i had received original or refurbished phone even after paying amount for brand new phone. Battery life was bad , it took 5 hours to get 80% battery charge. Showing 35% and then suddenly stat showing 10%.

Battery discharege with in 2 days. other wise it is good.,2
Not at all good,2
It's stopped working within a week. Only one side is working. How do I return and get a new one ?,2
Came to know when I called Customer Care for some help that 'there is no online service available for this model & we need to take the printer to near by service center'. It would have been good if they add this point in the Product Details list. When we know that there is no online service available we would not have opted for this model.,2

"Hi, giving my feedback after 2 days of use..

Pros
1. Looks really premium with amoled colour screen
2. Heart rate monitor, step count and sleep tracking also working nice
3. More display option and also u can create your customise display

Cons.
1. As they have mention that we will get 20+ days battery backup but mine bands battery started draining after 4 hours of use and within 14 hours battery is at 88% only even at moderate use ...as per my calculation it will last for 5-6 days max and this is the biggest disappointment for me.
2. My previous mi 3 band used to give me 15-16 days battery backup",2
"Not so easy to setup dual band wifi with different SSID and different password.
Team should check on this and make a proper user guidelines document.
Also state that how dual band wifi helps for total 50mbps speed, how it would devide the speed to 2.4g and 5g bands. I worked 3 hours to set it up for dual band. Worked well now.

Writing this after a day --> Today the router simply not working for 5g band.. no configuration change or device location change i had done. Instead 2.4 band working as expected.. very strange behavior of both devices TP link Archer A7 router as well as Tpnlink range extender RE200. Both devices are costly.. compared to other products .. really got frustrated with both devices.",2
Too bad as its just working for some months...It was a bad experience for me as it didn't work good and loosen up easily... 😑😑😑,2
Left side bud got damaged within a month. So disappointing.,2
"Before I bought this, I was using Mi Band 3 and Mi Band 4, no problems with any of those bands!

I wanted upgrade from Band to Watch, so I decided to wait for AmazFit Bip U.

But as soon as I received the product, it was damaged, as we can see a small scratch on the display, I returned it straight away and ordered Honor Magic Watch 2, works fine flawlessly.",2
not worth value for money.,2
"The sound quality is not that good. The right earpiece stopped working after like two months. I expected these headphones to be of decent quality, but it's not, it's worse.",2

Very dull screen display even after increasing brightness.,2
Worst fake product,2
👎🏻,2
"There is nothing great about this product. I upgraded from TP link wr41n and believe me there is no increase in the wifi signal coverage at all. Although I must say the 5g speed is a charm but the vicinity is too small. The usb port and connectivity is outdated. You need to tweak windows machine to support it. Ipad would not accept it at all, directing to buy a paid third party software. If you are looking buy this for USB Nas, I would suggest buy a separate wireless usb hub instead.
One more interesting observation, when you have one or two signal bar, the internet would not work at all.",2
"Steps count is very worst, all sports mode are not accurate. Only for display is good battery life is not more than 3days.",2
I liked the MiBand 3 better because the screen felt a bit more premium. With this you can see where the display unit is and aesthetically feels a bit cheaper. Maybe in a generation or two theyll have the screen blended nicely so that it doesnt feel like a prototype device.,2

"Pathetic smart watch, falsely marketed as Indian brand as it's made in China. Cheap looking watch with typical Chinese low cost UI. Amazfit is a much better option if you want a Chinese smartwatch.

"Writing this after a month of use. I must say this phone has many flaws. I have over 70% of devices are from Samsung however this product is a real disappointment.

1. Finger lock mostly doesn't work (never had this problem with my oneplus phone). I made repeat registration. It simply takes 6 to 7 press to work. My other phone sensor never had this problem.
2. Pocket sensor doesn't work most of time(even after you enable it) and after every walk/cycling I see my phone showing 30-40 attempts made to open phone(even in jeans) and phone gets locked for many second.
3. Chromecast is not available for Android TV(was expecting it to be default) I need to research more but I didn't get any option for screen mirroring on Android TV
4. You don't have option of vibration with ringer option(ridiculous) you can select either of option. This one was most annoying and never expected.
5. Tap and connect feature to samsung devices are another flop show. It hardly connect.
6. Face lock is also unreliable(works 7/10)

Initially when I bought this I had a trouble with its installation, as it required 2 days for self charging to provide backup. I reached out to the seller and they assisted me on how to use it. Until 1 month back router was working as per expectation. After 22 months, ups stopped working, when I reached out to seller they mentioned the product is out of order and now you have to go for a new one. Since the adapter you were using was less than 2 A hence the life of ups has got over soon. But on contrary when I read about the product on their page it clearly says that its compatible with 12V and less than 2A adapter. Also seller told they have got many such complaints from other customers too. That means I am not someone new with this experience. They told since you are an existing customer we will give you coupon code to get this at discounted rate, but the code only reduces the amount by 200. This is a total scam where they know their products life and set up a good way to make money.",2

Everything was good at first.. Sounds were great. But then the pain slowly crept in.. Too be precise the anti helical fold part of the ear suffers the most pain due to the pressure of the earpads.. The ear pads is the only con on this head phone.. But not gonna return it cos i use these head phones for listening to sounds tat i dont want to be heard outside(if u know wt i mean..lasts only for 5 to 10 mins..😂). Would not recommend this.,2

So, when you run out of ink, just buy a new printer and not ink cartridges. It's cheaper that way.

By the way, the printer is clunky and very very basic. No wifi or bluetooth connectivity, no built in paper cassette, no nothing. In this day and age when printers themselves are dinosaurs, this one is way too backward.",2
"My feedback after 4 months of using.

It is worthless, getting disconnected frequently. The bluetooth driver in this headphone is not stable. It crashes your mobile and restart, if you disconnect.

Don't waste money.",2
"After one year and a half, this product stopped picking my broadband cable internet.",2
Does not show correct time. Either it runs fast or is slow and there is no way to manually set the time. Anyone with similar experience? Otherwise other functions are ok.,2
This doesn't meet my expectation and even video call is not supported,2
i want replacement,2
Touch screen does not work many times,2
I received fake product. It was just 3 months I received this product and the earphones were not working now. Amazon gives you 1 year warranty but it was mentioned no where how to claim that warranty.,2
"The printer lasted hardly a year with normal usage. Print quality is good for this price and other functions works perfectly.
But keep in mind ink absorber gets full just after ink tank gets empty and printer becomes useless.",2
"Problem with display.
Gets gang",2
camera is very blur and bad. overall a good phone with smooth touch,2
Using this for 3 months now. Sleep tracking is very pathetic. I sleep for 8 hours it shows 11 hours. This is on regular basic. Never it is even close. Outdoor running tracking is even worst. I ran 5kms. It is just showing 2kms. It is simple digital wrist watch. Nothing smart about it. Very disappointed.,2
Touch is not working sometimes and the device is slow.,2
5 GHz connection seems good but 2.4 GHz Band performance is pathetic with frequent disconnections and very very average range. This is the first time I'm using TP-Link most probably this will be the last time too.,2
Camera quality is sooo poor☹️,2

I read some reviews and they also said that the mic was not working
But first of all let's appreciate Amazon parcel service it was really fast
I got the headphone on the second day of ordering without prime. It was really fast
But the mic of the headphones was not good like it did not work with any device, whether it is a laptop, a PC or a mobile",2
Slow charge hota h 5 minit me 1%,2
"Good, but sometimes it disconnects and reconnects, very irritating# bluetooth",2
"Isnt accurate and even as I walk with my hands moving continuously, it pauses for a few seconds very often. Battery life is good.",2

Excellent product. Highly recommend it.

No AUX cable inside the BOX only converter is there . I suggest to buyer to see the demo first on shop or malls then only buy . this is my worst deal ever on AMAZON . & the product has no return facility.",2
"Tracking of steps and sleep monitoring is faulty, the accuracy of stress level monitoring is also questionable. Basically software is a big fail.

But offlate, from some days back, sound stopped coming from one of the earphones . The headphone comes with a 1 year warranty. My headphone is still under warranty ,so i mailed the Ptron support email address but haven't got any response from them yet. Not even sure i will get any response or not.

Headphones were good but there doesn't seem to be any support from Ptron.

It is a great product but.......it is not even durable as it will definitely stop working after a couple of months......I bought this product in February......and now it stopped working....like one earphone is not working now......and if you see the warranty thing.....it takes alot of time..as the video suggests it will be recovered within a month....that's not true baby.........it takes atleast 5 months .,2

Always epson is easy to install but this time firmware problem. Printer is dead for past 2 weeks.,2
"I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. The router continually turns on and off itself and often loses connectivity making using it a very harrowing experience. It is impossible to get a stable connection for extended use be it for video calls, gaming or shopping. I tried updating the firmware, resetting it multiple times but there is no improvement. TP - link forums also show that I'm not the only one facing such issues.",2
Iam oder 5.1 but zebronics give 4.1 one speaker not working veery bad,2
"Speed not beyond 100 mbps, my internet provider suggested a different product",2
No good,2
Sound quality is ok but headphones are less durable. Cushion is not of good quality. You need to be very careful with it while usage as it can easily be broken.,2
"good

Edit: 16May2021: After a couple of years, updating the review. Initially Resonate UPS worked like a charm and provided a backup of upto 45mins without a hassle. After about an year's time it dropped to 20-30mins and post 2 yrs the battery is dead, not even sustaining 5mins of backup now. It is a false claim to say 4hrs of uninterrupted backup though the maximum backup I have witnessed was about 45mins when the product was new.
Otherwise, no issue with installation or usage.",2
Phone is very slow work in other smartphones and camera quality low in night and evening time,2
"Camera quality below then 5MP n battery is drain out in 12 hours...
So if you have extra money you should go for it...",2
Sound quality is good but the product durability is really bad I don't think it's an original JBL product. I'm sure you won't be able to use this for a year cus I've been using this for a few months and it's almost completely broken,2
Money value product,2
"The product is very average compared to price. I ordered it during the launch and would say, the marketing and actual results vary alot. Below are the pros and cons of the product. I purchased Amazefit Bip U 2 weeks before and would recommend Amazefit Over this. The Amazefit watch is loaded with many features, operates smoothly without any delays in response and most important, has rich look with multiple watch faces.

Amazefit Bip U - 5/5
Noise colorfit 3 pro - 3/5

Noise Colorfit Pro 3 :

Pros-
Bigger Dial compared to other watches in this range.
Display is good.

Cons -
Though display is good, the watch faces given are very very poor. Looks cheap quality and none is good.
No tracking of counts on watch faces.
There is lag in motion sensor when you lift wrist.
Strap quality is average.
Has 50 around watch faces but very simple.",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Watch count my Bed's HR, SPO2 and BP, Heart Breaking experience. Think 10 time's before purchasing the watch. It gives random results.😢",2
You can easily avoid buying it and get lucky! The product is not up to the mark and is a corrupt copy of fitness gadgets of apple and fitbit at a reasonably high price than it deserves. Its mobile app sucks too!,2
Not up to expectations. One side stopped working after a month,2
The cartridge didn't even print 15 colour prints.. It was over by then.. will the same continue with all the cartridge s??,2
"Product stopped after 20 days .
Not able to claim warranty also.",2
I personally feel of return ing it bcoz it's very painful on my ears ..after an hour i need to put them off or else it causes severe pain,2
I got my headphone but I had a dout whether they are of original Sony or not.there no Sony box or cover for this product.previously I had the same product the sound quality of this product is some wired compared to that.,2
Too small,2
Amazon delivered a defective piece.,2
Worst product,2
Camera nt gud,2
"Not good phone. I was replaced my M30 , but it was wrong decision. This phone is not worth to buy, just for battery life.",2
Needed to take to service center within 45 days. There are software issues in this product . Don't buy it,2
Phone is not too much good cemra is not 48 mp real and display is not good just normal phone,2
I had purchased two routers. One of them is working perfectly and the other one is now. Looking for the replacement.,2
Very bad battery backup. Someone notification for the call does not display.,2
The device do not have any option of tracking the gym workouts. Apart from tracking steps and sleep it is of no use.,2
After a while of usage the headphone got one sided and you have to adjust to hear sound from both ends of headphone. Its okay for a short time use not worth it for longtime usage.,2
Camera is very bad 👎,2
"Worst phone ever, camera fells like its 8mp not 48 battery power way too low not 6000 mah features like its 10years old phone.very bad phone don't buy ever.",2
"Battery is not first charging. 6000 mah is totally false. Performance of battery is worse than vivo 4000man. To fully charged, it takes time more or equal to 4 hours.",2
Left - right balance is incorrect. Can hear higher volume on right than left. Battery indication of earphones on mobile is also improper. It's fine since it's priced at half of what a normal bluetooth earphones would cost.,2
"The sound quality is good but within 3 months, right bud is not working and i am unable to hear anything.. can the manufacturer or seller replace the same.",2
Earcups has been not fixed properly,2
"Step tracking is very poor, it only counts 75-80 steps out of 100, if u run 4km on this watch u actually ran 5km in reality, checked with few other smart watches cheaper than this they actually track 95 steps, dont buy for tracking ur steps, buy only if u want a poor man apple look alike smart watch",2
The product feels cheap. The black cartridge finished in just 10 prints. Completely dissatisfied.,2
"I bought this as an upgrade to my entry level Tp-Link 841N router, which has served pretty well so far. Ours is a 1500 sq ft house and the existing router serves almost the entire house, barring some distant corners or areas. But it gives trouble while playing videos from my iPhone 7 to the newest Apple TV. So I was excited to get this new router. I was hoping that its multiple antennas and dual band will be helpful to increase the throughput and range both. Note that the company claims 1300 Mbps throughput with this device.

While the new router did extend the coverage and could now fully serve the entire house, including distant corners, I was mighty disappointed with the LAN throughput. I used iperf3, a well known tool to measure link speed, but I could never go beyond 200 Mbps, that too when both the devices are in the same room. As soon I moved to the second room (still just couple of meters away, but with a wall in between), the throughput dropped to 100 Mbps and after second wall it dropped to less then 40 Mbps. I tried various devices, like iPhone 7, 2014 Macbook Pro, another latest Dell laptop, but nothing helped. In fact, on Amazon's suggestion, I also ordered a replacement and tried that, but no luck.

Then I called up Tp-Link support and gave them remote access to my machine. After spending almost 40 minutes on the phone, they couldn't diagnose anything and promised to have some senior person call me the next day. Unfortunately, I did not get the call at the agreed time and hence I decided to return the router. Tp-Link finally called me the next day after I returned the router. They then promised me that they will repeat the tests in their labs and send me a report. That report never came.

I am still thinking what's the next router to try, May be Netgear or Asus. For now, the 841N is streaming Netflix videos pretty fine to my HD TV, so I am not feeling the urgency.",2
"We connected all speakers 3 days back,as it was gift to my sister. It opened after one month. After using 3 days, we found all speakers heating up and got smell of burning and now its not working. Already passed replacement time. Whom to connect for repair or replacement ? Need support.",2
If you want to waste money then go and donate someone but don't ever fcuking buy this. Cheep quality plastic low sound quality and poor customer support belive me I am done with boat. I have brought this 20 day ago and see this wtf happened.,2
The product does not come even close to my earlier D-link 150mbps router in terms of the range. Don't fall the 3 antennas they are pretty much useless. Instead buy dlink 150 or 300mbps. Atleast you will get nice range. By the my house is big 3bhk. I kept the router in the center of my house. But the range is very poor. Also wired connectivity is also poor. Don't buy. Probably going to purchase a new one.,2
The product is not what was expected. This product does not support more than 4 devices and hangs quite often. Good for low usage. It has to be rebooted to functions Correctly.,2
Camera not working,2
"Its tracking outdoor running wrongly. When I run 6 km, it shows 14 km. Not sure what is wrong with it. Check my screenshot. It shows i ran a km in 3 min which is mostly impossible. If u plan to buy it for running, please don't.",2

"It has good bass but the crispiness is so bad in wired mode. And don't even talk about wireless mode, bad in all ways. Also it's not made for big headed ppl and after 45 or 30 mins of playing your ears will hurt. The aux cables quality is pretty bad. Noise cancellation was good but it became bad afterwards.",2
"Very poor sound quality.
There’s no base that you can hear. Mids is okayish. Treble again is very poor.
Haven’t tested the battery as I’m returning it within half an hour after I received this product.
Not worth the price you say.",2

I did like this for continuous 3 days in a row. It's worst experience anyways. Go for other good brands available In market. Don't believe 9 days battery frod by amazfit.",2

And other app or text it works properly.. like sanjay bisht",2
"Beautiful product. Foldable, which makes it easier for storage and carrying, compatible with all devices with an audio jack... Good dustproof material and awesome quality with plastic. The wire is a problem due to tangling with other cables. It is fine with itself and has minimal tangling. Affordable and has a decent sound quality which is amazing for the price you pay for the product. For a budget below Rupees 1000 this is a smart choice. Product is durable, but with using the plastic arc will bend wider to give a better fit, now is this a defect or a special mechanism is a tough decision because mine has bent wider which is causes the headphones to slip-off my head which is giving me a tough time. The product is really nice but not for use if you’re aiming to use it more than a year.",2
"Range is good and its easy to install as well. But I did not like the speed. on 5GHz band, I was getting max of 95 Mbps, whereas the ISP person with same model was getting 143 Mbps. The plan is for 150 Mbps. This looks to me faulty product and not sure the next piece that you will get will also be faulty or not.",2
"Never ever purchase any product from amazon. They hardly entertain refund request. After complaining the issues, they will trouble you a lot giving various instructions for troubleshooting, will ask for images and a lot more. Only replacement is available. Flipkart is much better in this sense.",2
"Loved it the first time I got it. Worked fine for almost two years. Then, the left side stopped working. After a few days, the right side gave in. Since, it was comfortable even when used for extended periods of time and I liked the sound quality, I went ahead and ordered another one. As luck would have it, this time it worked for three months. Now, only one side is working for the last few days.",2

"Okay so i got this monitor just for amd freesync, if you don't have an AMD gpu you are better off buying something else. So initially my laptop was quite old and i used a vga cable, the picture was ok and i thought that slight bluriness was due to the vga cable.As I had just finished building my gaming rig. I noticed that this monitor has an hdmi problem. It does not work with your hdmi port from a laptop tablet etc. I called in lg customer care and they told me that i have to pay 500 bucks plus cost of its motherboard in order to get it fixed on warranty. I was shocked. I warned them about consumer court and slowly they came to their senses. I had everything on call recorder hence i was able to negotiate with these money mongers. Finally their representative came with a new board and replaced it, but here comes the surprise even the new board was defective and the monitor is still not accepting any hdmi input. They have promised to resolve the issue but its been more than a month and still they are ""working on it"". Their executive was clueless and made excuses everytime about the issue. I am fed up with this monitor. I would suggest you all to look somewhere else. This is not what you want.",2

Screen quality and build is pretty ordinary. Samsung M31 provides a much better quality phone at an incremental cost of just 2K with all the features. I think this is the reason they just sell this phone via flash sale so that a user doesn't get time to think.,2

I am using 3 month it's coming problem no power,2
"Prompt delivery and the prints (one sided) are fine.

The biggest concern is the cartridge.
I bought the printer as i needed something cheap that would print 10-15 documents a day, 5 days a week. The cartridge shows low on ink from the 1st week and after another week or so just prints blank pages. The problem is that the cartridge is not actually empty. That is Just HP's way of making us buy expensive cartridges. The color cartridge is useless and you can't print anything even if one of the cartridge is full and the other is low on ink. It's a cheap trick and I am switching to Epson for now.",2
Poor quality.nyc product in this price,2

"When I tried to unplug or plug cables backside while power is on, I got electric shock, thank god, I didn't drop it that time. Experiencing the same shock another side of the HDMI cable also while connecting it to my laptop. Coming to picture quality, very good product at this price. My only concern is the electric shock.",2

This product is not up to the mark and it's not working properly since I bought it.,2
"Sounds Good but i think the Bass quality should be more good , currently after 2 months of use one of the side of earphone stopped working",2
The product seemed but be very slow ! Takes 5 to 10 secs to show a display when you try look at it while wearing ! It was said you can silence a incoming call in your phone from the watch but that's not it ! And when I tried to return the product I got only replacement option totally unfair!,2
Cheap sound quality.... Play the song overlapping..... Pen drive socket shock....,2
the headphone when first arrived were pretty decent in the price range. incidentally with usage one of the earphones started losing its sound to virtually non-functional now. Possibly a defective piece. Placing a return/ replace request since the makers promise a year guarantee.,2
Low sound,2
"The product is worth the money but for only about 6 months after that the wires start peeling apart and slowly mic stops working,looking for jbl support but this product is not mentioned on jbl support website.

It is a average product,2
"Not a great product, it has limited feature. Also It need a mobile application to use it, this has to change with other options. Quality of charger is not good. Its okay, that we are atleast getting these kind of product for 2300 inr. But after reviewing it in internet says, for 2300 inr they should provide mi band 4 with nfc. Without nfc they should charge us around 1700 inr. I really dont know who is cheating us, either amazon or vendor. Customers are always be fool because of offers. I have realised it.",2

The service call centre of TP LINK is of no use ,better email them and you can get reply in a day or two.TP LINK SERVICE GUYS mailed me that you send it to service center by courier,since i wanted router urgently i went myself to service centre that is in VASAI and got Replaced with the new one.But my whole day got wasted going there.Hopefully it will not give me any trouble in future.So people you can judge by my experience,don't know i should give them 2 star also.",2
Bad product. You will find different alternative. Don't go for this. Signal strength is really poor. I have used different brands this is really pathetic. Feeling cheated with positive reviews.,2
Worst step counting,2
"The printer is not as user friendly as claimed. Event after following all the prompted actions, it encountered problems while connecting through HP app on IOS. With much effort, the printer finally started but still did not receive print command from mobiles. Had to connect to PC using USB for printing. So much for dual band direct WIFI feature. Will update review after using it for a month or two.",2
"The product looks amazing in pictures but in real it doesn't keep up to the promise. Also very important thing they don't have RETURN policy, only allowed for replacement. So be very sure before buying it.
The heart rate doesn't work most of the time.
The touch stops responding frequently, even at times it seems not to work the way you want and the screen freezes.
The watch looks cheap than the other hybrid watches available in the market. If you are very lucky the watch would work fine for you or else you would end having a product which doesn't work.",2

"I wanted a good quality router which could handle full HD streaming on multiple devices as well as support my home office at the same time. After reading all the rave reviews here and other sites I decided to buy this product. I really wanted to like this product. However, my expectations were completely shattered when I tried installing it. I connected to the 2.4 GHz network and sitting just 10 feet away in the next room I was unable to open the router home page. Only when I moved my laptop in the line of sight of the router that I could access this device. Also, after struggling for several hours this device was unable to connect to the internet. I tried the auto as well as the manual setups; reset it several time and tried again, but it did not budge. My cheap D-Link DIR-615 has much better signal strength and connects to the internet in a jiffy (30 odd seconds from power up). Frustrated, I filed a return request. One extra star for the great support that Amazon provided and returned without a fuss.",2

And the most important thing is a Chinese product not made in india its just a dumping.",2

Cons. Only good in bright sunlight and can't compare with go pro.
I had bought One plus 8t phone and that camera can't becompared to it at all one plus camera is century ahead . Secondly there is no touch screen very very difficult to operate in this digital World without touch screen.

I disliked:

Good mobile at this cost but slow,2

Looks good but sound is below average,2
"Initially I have received a faulty product. While used it for the 1st time, I felt the sound so cheap and replaced the product. But the new replacement sounded better but have a physical issue for the cushion placement which I was okay with.
I have ordered them for Rs.999 in flash sale.
I was using boAt rockerz 400 for around 2 years and they have done pretty decent job and had a physical damage because of my rough usage. My main purpose to buy Bluetooth headset is to connect to TV and for mobile usage I would use through the aux cable.

Sound Quality: I would rate rockerz 400 better than rockerz 450 as the sound quality feels cheap initially and you should tweak some equaliser settings to get the max out of it(it's not the case with 400 series which by default comes with decent output). The bass is good but on compromising the quality of vocals(can be optimised with phone settings. If you can't change the phone audio settings, then you probably landed on a wrong product).

For TV also I would upvote 400 over 450.
However considering the price point of 999 it's decent but however if we can raise budget by few hundreds, we can find some better ones.
Noise Cancellation is better in 450 over 400 series

Design: I can use it for very long hours but for the initial couple of days your ears will be paining a bit but later it gets adjusted and has very good comfort levels. Quality of material feels good but am skeptical about the material used for size extensions. The size is a bit small when compared to others. The quality of aux cable provided is damn cheap and am using my aux cable of rockerz 400 which was of excellent quality

Overall can be considered for a deal price of 999 but not worth more than that.",2
product was good. But life was pathetic. stopped working after 2 months of use.,2
"Pixelated text and fonts cause headache while working or browsing. The system settings and menu is also pixelated, so it's not the issue with specific operating system.

I trusted LG after reading lot of good reviews but no-one pointed this pixelation and blurry text/fonts issue. I hope my review helps others to make informed choice",2

I am using several boat headphones and earphones. With that belief in the product quality and sound quality I purchased boat rockerz 450. This product disappointed me it doesn't have the boat signature sound at all. Moreover I paid extra for getting this product as well. One good thing about this product is its design and build quality. But that quality with better sound and this we can get it for 700 or lesser than that. I hope both I will definitely take care of these quality issues and bring quality products for Indian customers.,2
"The product is not working at all. I am in remote area. Can't go to the service center in this pandemic situation.

Who are living in remote area. Don't try the product because the service centres will be in city.",2

Average headphone. No bass at all. sound quality is average. call quality is not that great.,2

The phone is laging for every 10 seconds. And the the second camera has a damage which I didn't notice for a month. Please I'm waiting for an exchange.,2
Better to take a monopod with legs.,2
An okayish router overall and VFM. One serious issue is WiFi signal. I barely get a single point of WiFi signal even in the next room. I use this router 24/7 and I am facing frequent disconnects and poor WiFi signal. D-Link is better than this one. Also the LED lights are so dim and they are barely visible as well as bring poorly positioned.,2
"I bought this product in August 2020, after 5 months of using only one earphone is audible and the cable also damaged. please do the needful as the product is still in warranty period.",2
the ink gets over very soon only after taking out 4-5 pages printing not very clear.,2
"A useful product indeed for typical Indian power supply situation with frequent outages. However I'm editing my review to note that this is a use and throw product with no serviceability or battery replacement options by the seller.

One year update: the battery inside has 'died;. The unit is no longer proving even a minute of backup.
My version stopped providing backup after 8-9 months of use.

Update 2: Contacted Resonate support and was informed that product warranty is only 6 months. It cannot be repaired by Resonate support and the only option they offered me was a discount code to purchase a new unit.

Disappointed. In hind sight, I should've just ordered the cheaper chinese alternatives. I'm down revising my original rating to 2 stars (for quick shipping and good packaging).",2

"Worst than Nokia and Microsoft mobile. I am from sales background and pure need of mobile for calling and switching multiple apps. I have been using Samsung J7 Prime from 5 years and still that is going good. But today's generation boys make me feel my mobile is old and internet speed isn't great because of old device and neeneed to look for new mobile. And I asked to go for this redmi. I was 90% sure I will go with Samsung again but they made me to belive Redmi is better than Samsung.

Now the story begin. It's absolutely scrap. Redmi might compete with anyone but they aren't great. My internet speed remain same as I use to have on years old Samsung. Samsung nevers hangs in 5 years, but this mobile hangs frequently. I m irked customer of Nokia which troubled me after 1 year use but this mobile irk just after 20 days.

Photo quality I beluve J7 5 year old mobile camera us equally good than this 48 mp camera.

Connecting headphone is headache. I have 2-3 google meet a day, now I always connnect with Laptop as this mobile burn my fingure to connect hard or to stress hard to keep connecting headphones.

The day received I have trouble but Amazon denied to replace or return back saying this mobile is perfectly ok just by installing a app on your mobile and fool you to belive mobile is ok. After hard argument they suggest to contact Redmi service center. On the name of Replacement it's trap. But it at your risk.

Don't get trab of young generation promoting redmi to buy because only if camera. Choice is yours, you buy it's for calls or camera.

Lastly this mobile keep on promoting to download all useless app like play rummi, moz, chat share many many more. It's already have plenty of useless and harmfull preloaded apps. I dosent understand is this Redmi owned by single management. Everday same usless apps are recommend to download again and again. It's junk box. Good buys to redmi forever and byby to Amazo for never I will buy mobile on Amazon.",2
This does not support double side printing. We need to first print odd pages then turn around the pages for printing even pages. This is a basic feature to have in printer that is over 8k,2

Don't buy this watch
The best watches definitely Amazfit,noise,etc",2
Found scratch on sensing part and giving random results for heart rate range from 57 to 97 for same person in stable condition. Even touch screen sometimes does not work.,2
The product had a three year replacement warranty and ran without any issue for three years but switched itself off just after three years.. there are no service centers of Tenda nearby so had to purchase a new router. But this time went for a different brand.,2
I did not like this product as this is not helping me to monitor my activity accurately as this is taking wrong step count even while driving. I'm hugely dissapointed with the product. Need a refund.,2
"The routers gives WiFi signal in the room where it is placed. If you try connecting from next room, it will frequently disconnect the internet. The customer responses are delayed and they usually ask to visit the service centre. After my problems, I checked with my friends who are using this router and they said the same feedback and they all changed their routers.",2
Not worthy I say... Lot of issues with the device,2
Un able to hear others voice..,2
Nice one,2
"The overall quality is poor and flimsy. Not easy to understand or learn the functions. The FIT India free app is just a marketing jargon, not able to get connected or make use of the same.
The watch is designed in California & India but no mention where is the watch made.",2

One earbud stopped working after 4 months,2
This watch is not worth 4k and doesn't look like smart watch. SpO2 measurement takes a lot of time and at the end says- measurement failed. The app it connects with has made my phone slow. Heart rate measurement is also not that good. I means it basically lags in very action m I preferred it over other brands after going through some YouTube reviews but I now I feel that all of them were paid for giving good reviews.,2
"worst, waste of money",2
"The product worked well for the first year. Now the battery has stopped working. Called the seller. Looks like the warranty is only for 6 months and it doesn't cover battery. So, overall not a very reliable product",2
"One ear stopped working after 1 year and 3 months !! This is just sad compared to my earlier similar one from Sony which lasted me a close to 4 years after which I bought this .
Sound quality was not that great to Sony either. Next one I am switching back to Sony or some other brand. Also was slightly let down thinking it would be a quality level of JBL GO",2
Initially the printout on glossy paper was very impressive. But just in a few days time the color fades away rather drastically. Don't know if it happens on other brands or not. Disappointed,2
Wrost printer..after refilling the cartridge its giving only 2-3 pages per 2-3 ml ink...very disappointing,2
Just ok,2
Below average printer and very bulky. The printing speed is super slow. Not recommended for daily usage..,2

I recently bought the MI band 4 and it dramatically miscalculates the steps taken! I was riding on a two wheeler and it counted almost 650+ steps. I cannot just figure it out how does it even do that.,2
Started malfunctioning within two weeks of use.,2

"The version 4 is the best. No need to buy the 5th. It's app is very demanding and battery gets consumed very fast. I had all versions since it's launch also gifted a few. 4th gen is best. It seems like they are trying to bla ck mail you like a typical chi nese apps. It just wont work if you don't give the calling permission or location permission. It was so smooth till 4th gen band.

By it if you have to but if you have 4th don't upgrade.",2
ear padding started weathering off within 7 days of usage. Totally disappointed with such cheap build quality.,2

again the step, sleep...etc data goes missing of whole day in the app,
complaining about it is so so difficult in th app, no one should bother too.",2
No doubt a great fashion style. Accuracy not upto the mark and battery backup is less than 14hrs.,2
Charging port is not fit for the band.. every time you have to keep your eye on it while it charging.. except this problem the band is extremely amazing.. and look awesome,2
I purchased on Jan 2018. Very low watt just 100 it makes less sound for tv or pc anything. I used creative speaker 2.1 before comparing to zeb 6860. Creative is worth of buy and clear bass. Zeb disappointed.. so sad,2

Tough Installation,2
"So far I ve no issues regarding the producr quality and delivery,it was gud...further comenting after using the product for a week or so...but as revealed above in the pictures,I think I ve got a used or already opened product,I mean whenever I ve bought the product from the store,I ve got it well packed and sealed(in a transparent plastic cover)but here
....it is without any covering or seal.
Thats why our family never likes to buy such stuff from amazon....flipkart is best for electronic items and gazettes",2
Could have been better. Not a great fit and the sound experience is very basic like a ear phones brought from a street vendor.,2

Aux connectivity not stable some times one side sound coming in aux cable. During aux connection some abnormal continue sound

"Average product, i was excepting more from this watch. Quality is not that good straps is also looks like cheap and sensor quality is very poor",2
"Edit: May 22, after a month of use : Amazon providing 6K off now, no wonder why
Cons:
1. Finger scanner is works only 6/10 times. May 22: Little better after the recent software upgrade
2. Felt heat in the back even with very less usage. Understand that the phone have SD 865 and a external modem which means heat will be continued issue for this phone.
3. Face reorganization will not work in low light (iPhone 11 unlocks very smooth in the same lighting condition)
4. It felt like a very old model phone
5. Volume and power button are in the same side (very hard to use)
6. Low light photos are horrible
7. Take ~5 hours for full charge. Battery discharge very fast if you have any peripheral connected to it.
8. Videos will not play in full screen because of screen bezel in the top.

Pros:
1. Good for basic photo
2. Phone is not large but heavy with 4500 mah battery
3. Sound and voice call quality is good
4. 120 Hz refresh rate is buttery smooth

With my one month observation, I will not recommend S20 FE 5G, recommends iPhone 11 128GB based on my usage of both phones.",2
Call notification is not working properly . When phone rings. After 10-12 second band start vibrate .,2
Bkz in this bass control is not available.,2
Phone is ok but system is laging too much,2

Will gift this to some kid
Not for music lovers",2
Product is not good do not invest money in this,2
"First it's was working fine. I just had this earphone for 3-4 months, now the leftside of my earphones have no sound. They give 1 year warranty and it's not helpful. Can't even reach them to replace. It's very bad service. Honestly they need to provide support on this products as we are paying for it. If this is the case then, why to buy their products when we can spend less money in local products which also lasts for 3-4 months in cheaper price. Really disappointed with company like boAt.",2
"At beginning the earphones were functioning properly but with time quality degarded. Noise cancellation is becoming zero. Microphone has become pathetic and earphone sound quality is equivalent to those normal earphones you get when you a low budget phone.

My personal experience with this earphone is not good. Not worth buy. I dont recommend",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 It's war is not good, it's totally damaged",2
I purchased this product last week and needed a replacement since the end connector has loose connection. Unfortunately the replacement delivered also has the same issue but Iam keeping it. Sound quality is pretty average. A samsung earphobe that comes along with mobile is much better in quality.,2
"I received the order with the box unsealed. I immediately put a refund request. Then out of curiosity, I switched on the device, it didn't switch on. So I tried to put it on charging, but the device doesn't stay on the port, the port is too loose. Unless you keep holding the device while it charges, it won't charge.
My guess is that someone ordered, received, and opened a faulty device and returned it after finding the issue and the seller or someone resold the device.
Always check the condition of the received order, and do not trust an already unsealed product, especially electronic",2
The product is not worth. The headphone remote control stopped working in a month. Mic was not working properly in second month. Better suggestion is not to buy the product,2
Watse,2
"U gotta change ur claimed 9 days battery life. Lasted exactly 2.5 days, not once but twice in past 5 days since ur product was delivered. Big disappointment....!!! Now I have to carry another charger in my backpack. Thanks for this inconvenience😔",2

"Bad features are:
no screenshot feature, heavy weight, bad UI, not pickable on hand, average camera

good features are:
1. long battery life.",2
"I use a bluetooth mouse and keyboard with my laptop. This headphone just cant connect if I have them connected. I also have Samsung Buds which connects and works well while all other devices are connected. And there are a lot of bluetooth connection related interference.

Its missing basic features like changing the song, the bass and sound quality is average as well. I would suggest either go with a headphne 1k - 1.5k range or stretch to 7k-10k. These middle headphones are as good as the 1k - 1.5k range except the built quality. the built quality is good, but what to do with build quality if sound and features are sub par.

Overall a poor buy",2
Even I will not able to print 10 pages ink is not working only pink pictures are printing and from black and white it comes out blank page. Very hopeless total money waste,2
Not giving accurate information.,2

Other than that this is a very good printer for home use.",2

And Amazon replaced it another band, I found the above similar issue.
+ This time, I laid on bed for several mins, and when I wokeup and walked I and doing something. ..it displayed ""sat for too long"". I guess there is lag/delay. Or some issue with the band.

Long back I used mi band 4 it worked perfectly fine.",2

"Amazon should write about this product listing as outdated by Dlink. This product works good but is discontinued by Dlink in Jan 2017. However those who purchase can get warranty for product from Dlink.

Poor build quality. No wall mount available in market... no internal speaker,2
I was using this for a year and after that there was a power cut and when I started it again it was not working I have also reached to customer care which was a skype and I got the center address as well but there was no service center there was a locked home and no one was there.

"We need this device for small duration but then also inbuilt chargeable batteries do not last much. I have been using it for last 14 months and now it is not charging at all and need to buy another one. So, this item with 2k will only last for 12-14 months, which is waste.",2
Battery dead in 3 months. Laptop is very fragile and has a cheap look and feel. I felt bad for purchasing this laptop. Laptop is dead slow. Just bought this for online class. Fit for nothing else. With another 6k I should have brought a better one. Please dont but this and regret like me.,2

In less than a month’s use one of the sides stopped working, i got it exchanged the same issue took place again.

This time amazon delivery was to slow.. When I tried to connect this router with my BSNL connection it didnt connect.. I've tried several times but failed.. When I rebooted it went in to Bridge mode and it happen several time. I have to re-configure it every time I reboot the router. UI of the router connection setting is bad you don't get the idea that it's connected or not.. It shows status as UP and DOWN. Where as I have one Tenda router which has more better UI and Connection setup as well as strength of area coverage.. Using Tp-link 300mbps 2 Antenna Router I was getting 2-3 network bars near my workplace whereas Tenda 150mbps 1 Antenna router was producing more network bars than this one. I would suggest to go for Tenda Router as I'm using one Tenda ADSL2+ router and one Tenda regular router since 2-3 years till now never had a single problem with it.,2

Received broken remote. All other things ok,2

The Information given on product page is totaly wrong it can only print 2000 pages with an ink bottle which are black and white pages.

Instead of using this you can buy a power bank of 12v and a usb to router power cable and you are all set. The power bank will provide much more power backup than this.,2

2. The sound quality is okay for listening music but other than that it is of no use.

sleep tracker does not track short naps otherwise it’s ok. The step tracker is far from being accurate. A slight hand movement is considered as a step. The heart rate is lousy and does not give the correct heart beat count most times. One has to keep refreshing and hope for the correct heart beat count. The calories burnt tracker is a absolutely wrong. It shows less calories burnt. I picked another one for a friend and he has the same feedback. The notifications feature is good overall. That’s about it. A below average product.,2

"It's fine, but suddenly shuts and reboots once or twice every day. It's a pain when you are doing something important when the internet suddenly conks off.",2
"First suggestion, don't buy it. If you still want to for its cheaper price, then be ready for occasional non-functioning of unit. You need to switch off and restart. This is what I call a Chinese product, as we generally term.

Not so good as shown in video or in advertisement. Not satisfied with this watch. Mainly wrist movement display takes some second to show. Watch faces are common and boaring. I advise go to Amazon Fit beat it's better than Noise Colour fit pro. More upgradation is needed to manufacturer for success,2
"The camera provided in the phone is not 13mp at all.
Picture quality is not good and it does not reflect the true colors.
its ok that it is a cheap phone but atleast they should mention the correct configuration. If you compare camera picture quality with nokia phones I must say that 2mp camera in nokia made phones have better picture quality that 13mp of this phone. Its OK that this is vewry cheap phone but customer should not think that they will get a 13mp camera. Samsung or nokia make phones with 8mp camera might have better picture quality.

"[BIG UPDATE]
IT BROKE ALONG THE RIGHT HINGE, I WAS WEARING IT NORMALLY AND IT SPLIT OPEN ON ONE SIDE.
The extenders are weak. ( Pic inscuded) My boat 400s broke at the centre too. They need to concentrate less on celebrity endorsements and use the profits on materials and quality control. They still worked so I taped it up with a metal sheet. Still will give 2 stars for the sound.

[ORIGINAL REVIEW]

I've owned boat products such as the Rockerz 400 and some of their earphones and this is the best experience I've had with the product.
Review after 1 day of use and will update
Price I paid 1800
Pros:
1. Packaging is good for the first time
2. The build and finish is on par with headphones costing 3 times as much.
3. Range is next level, didn't experience any loss of connection in my entire house with the phone kept in one position.
4. Boat headphones have always been super uncomfortable but this time they have actually thought of that.
5. The cups are big and soft enough to fit your ears inside so they are over the ear.
6. Base is not amazing, let's just say it's above average, the sound is like a 20 % improvement on the Rockerz 400.
7. They have gone for a organic approach for the sound so the highs and lows are just ok .
9. Battery life is just as advertised
8. You literally can't find a better pair of headphones for less than 3k for sure.

Cons
1. I was not sure about how they actually look when I ordered cos the image of the product kept changing, it had flat cups and then doughnut type cups.
2. It's not as loud as I want it to be
3. They didn't include a aux Cable which is crazy as they ship those with all other models.
4. It does get warm in these and you will sweat
5. No noise cancelling as they mentioned and passive design is not that good",2
"Mi Band 4 Review...

Amazing Sleep tracking.
Bpm is so accurate.
Battery life is incredible.

Then why 2 stars??
Because, the charging Dock received here is awful that it doesn't even work... The band maybe great, but it needs to be worked...

After some little tweaks, the Dock is working...I didn't expect this from XIAOMI...",2
"wifi not available.inkjet cartige little bit small.ink attached with printer seen low after 14 print. you can never refill ink bcoz if once show ink low by chepset and not allowed use fefill ink even if it have refilled.
you have to buy new inkjet which is cost almost the printer cost.i put this printer aside and never use it.hence i buy tank refill ink sys. printer again which have 7000 pages print capasity and u can refill again.",2
Its just 3/4 mtjs back i have purchasedNd today the router is dead its nt at all working.....,2
"Firstly, it does not function properly. The right headphone of the product is defective. Secondly, the bass quality is absolute rubbish. There is literally no bass in the sound heard no matter what you play. Thirdly, noise cancellation is below average. Do not fall for the hype and fancy descriptions.",2
"Here i mention few points about the product,
1. Packing is good.
2. wire is delicate, which may get teared soon.
3. not having "" L "" shaped connector, due to this many times earphones get disconnected while keeping in pocket.
4. Will be good only for music tat to with less bass sound .
5. No option to receive the call in headphone, even if we receive manually the sound is low.
6. After successfully using for year, i put it to dustbin as only right side headphone worked.

Suggested product: boAt BassHeads 225",2
This is not good product. We can't use continue even 2hours. It's not comfortable.,2
"Did not like this router, hangs it very frequently",2
"Poor sound quality , Not worth the price - coming from a guy who loves music !",2
"Using this Smart watch for 01 month. Here is the Pros and Cons.
Pros -
1. Sleek
2. Battery life is of 8 days.
Cons-
1. Very inaccurate. During driving bike in hot sun watch showing the 105 degree temperature. I believe it was showing outdoor temperature not body temperature.
2. Mobile notification on watch not consistent.
3. Touch is not good
4. Spo2 and BP tracker is not accurate.

Overall, not worth in ₹4400. Better to go for high end smart watch for better result.
Think twice before buying.",2
This printer doesn't work with Mac unless Canon decides to release drivers. Please be mindful when you purchase this item.,2
The mic of the product is not working of only 1 head phone so i want an refund,2
"It was lost after 3 days..😠 the belt was not good and it was the 3rd time I get to know that mi band is lost but this time it was mine 😩

You can go for Honor band 5 the only reason for it is that it has a watch like band which will not open automatically like Mi band and hence is more reliable and could not fall easily!

Other things of both the bands are same. I have uploaded the pictures of Honor band which I ordered from Flipkart after mi band was lost.",2
"As you can see, the signal strength is very weak at -93db at distance of 432m.
The 5ghz band is not at all in the picture, which means you are going beyond 400m 5ghz won't catch.",2
Signal is very low,2
ink is over after takin 30 prints. too bad performance,2
"Wifi speeds are fluctuating, In the beginning I thought there’s a problem with my internet provider but I realised it after changing connection to the other provider. I’ve checked with neighbours connection with the same provider. It’s pretty good and it’s the router with a defect.",2
"I am posting this review after 10 months of usage. Speed and wifi signal strength all are up to the mark. However, the one of the lan port stopped working after 6 months, within next 4 months another lan port stopped working. Therefore giving low rating.",2
Sound is good but bass is weak. Ian not setisfied this.,2
"I live in two storey house, installed this on ground floor near stair and I can't get proper signal on up stair room which is hardly 3 m and 2 m elevation.
Very disappointing.
It was very easy to set up for use at home.",2
"Sound quality not equal to same model same product.
Amazon product & Sony showroom same product sound quality different.",2
Its just stopped working after 6 days,2
The cartridge got damaged once you fill it for 2-3 times also the cartridges come with as high as at a price of 700-800. That gonna be difficult for one..,2
Don't buy it. That's all I can say. It is a cdm in the form of printer. You'll have to put money again and again into this printer.,2
One earpiece stopped working after 5 months. This won't work without amplification. So I wouldn't suggest this to buy for a mobile phone.,2
I recently purchased HP printer 2788. It has printing issues as it prints only on fourth corner of page while rest remains blank. I called customer care of HP they informed about motherboard issue which is manufacturing defect. I asked them to replace the printer but they didn't agreed and said that someone will visit to fix it or I go myself to center to get it done. This is a really bad approach. My printer is under warranty thereby needs replacement on manufacturing defect. I am requesting Amazon as a seller to help with this and get the warranteed product replaced.,2
after 1 hour its hurting in ears,2
Lines are created during colour printing in equal interval,2
very bad processor camera quality isnt very bad,2
"They are ok types. Keep falling from the ear. Even some times, the volume abruptly goes down.",2
"Material quality is average
Sound quality is poor with lots of buziness and side noise. You can not hear songs clearly ..feels like one of those high way loud speakers.",2
"बहुत ही खराब है,ज्यादा आवाज साफ नही है",2
Manufacturer box was damaged. There were tapes to fix the damage. Not sure the product was used.,2
"Don't buy it

I heard the name of ptron brand but it's so cheap and low quality product

Sound quality is too poor

Mic is fine

I apply for the replacement and hoping I'll get the good one... I'll update my review here if I'll satisfy wiTh it

But for now I'm feeling disappointed .",2
"THE PRODUCT NOT SUPPORT THE COMPASS ,NO SHORTCUT SCREENSHOT,IF WE TAKE A SCREENSHOT WE HAVE TO STRONGLY PRESS BOTH BUTTONS(ON OFF AND VOLUME CONTROL BUTTONS) HEAVY PHONE HANGING SOME TIMES.SIM TRAY NOT EXACTLY FIT TO SIMS,SPL FEATURES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THIS SAMSUNG M12 MOBILE , WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN REDMI PHONES",2
not much,2
If you thik to buy it consider infinity bluetooth range,2
"The first one I received had clouding issue and Amazon replaced it. The replacement was a much better than first panel but noticed a dead pixel and I decided to return the product. I ordered another brand’s monitor and that turned out to be more suitable for me after returning this. I have many appliances from LG in home but never faced a quality issue like this.

The monitor is not height adjustable and may go above your eye level. I bought the monitor for work from home purposes and only tested those functionalities. Ports have very good accessibility.

Amazon was very helpful in both times and I had a hassle free exchange.",2
"Don't waste your money
Buy this only if are working out regularly.
They say if you charge it once you can use for 14 days( it's false) the battery lasts only for 3-4 days with minimum usage and the sp02 monitor does not show the results most of the time
And the watch face is not customisable, there is no Alexa.",2
Not bad this price,2
Hanging problem,2
"This set shows good but works bad. Please send me immediately the Warranty papers so that I can go to the Service centre to check up why sound is heard only when speaker is on, as I can't talk to my office, friends and others property.",2
"Pretending to be a Smart watch using a dumb software.

A pop up came up with a useless disclaimer in between and the save button at bottom without a scrollable popup. See attached photo.

Not at all value for money. Software is not at all user friendly and intuitive. Many other far better smart watch out there (though not made in India).
Sadly I had no option to return it too 😞",2
"It turns out to be a costlier printer. i have hardly printed 10 sheets, but both the black & colour cartidges are showing very low ink level warnings. The replacement cost was Rs 2002. At this rate, per page printing works out to over Rs 200, as against their advertised cost of Rs 0.10. it is a total waste of money to buy this printer",2
It doesn't have WiFi calling,2
"Dislike that no additional bands available for this , hard to find screenguard. amazfit can arrange these.
Can improve watch faces.
always on display option not visible
not easy to shutdown
Rest all are good.",2
"Purchase few days ago...

"I got the watch,but there was a line appearing in the display right through the middle so was a detective product i have got. And i chose to replace the product the same day i got it,because i like the watch for it's pretty good design and style,but there was no replacement option and obviously i could only go for refund option. And again i ordered the same product and expect the delivery in a couple days. Kindly make sure that i get good quality product this time with zero defects .",2
I did not like this product as the connection between the call gets disconnected automatically which make unhappy with the product,2
"Not saying it's completely waste, i trust hp for laptops from years, as i have 2 already at home. But particularly this model performance is below par considering the specifications, should've gone for Intel processor rather than amd. *lags too much, high end softwares like autocad, sketch, coral draw, photoshop isn't compatible or recommended for this variant, it sucks!

*The only solution for lagging on this model is, you've to insert atleast 240GB SSD for smooth experience which cost around 3500/-",2
Very poor product. Playback doesn’t support on Mobile data sometimes. Sometime showing sdcard don’t support.,2
"Battery is average not good enough as given in specifications.
As per specifications battery backup during video play back is 34 hours but I guarantee that you will have to charge it thrice in 34 hours.
Charager becomes heat after 30 min of charging. And according to battery charger has low capacity to charge.
I don't like this phone.

I will have to return this phone.",2
"Camera picture quality is poor, display quality too .",2
"Very very heavy mobile , not purchase",2

"Very good phone for this reasonable price, only camera quality is not good, ok phone I am happy after using for one week. and after one month performance of the charger is slow and it a lock down period",2
Camera quality is worst its very very bad there is no clarity,2
It is wastage of money ... I preferred it over Skullcandy but didn't meet my expectations at all ... Won't buy it ever even won't recommend it too any of my known,2

My earlier TP link wireless n router 300 Mbps give me better signal strength than this router across my house

Won't recommend for a row house",2
Right speaker not working surprise to see fault in such small period.,2
My JBL headphones are not working properly.i purchased this on 21 sep .can i get this product again on warranty,2
WiFi coverage is just ok. I also use it with a LAN cable and get losses continuously. The ports aren’t that good I guess. My previous TP link router was better in this regard. I had to replace it because I shifted to a bigger house but this router didn’t live up to the expectations.,2

The sound quality was ok and due to the design you get noise cancellation but not a lot. It's not worth it don't buy,2
The sound quality is good. But it is easily breakable . The width adjusting bar is breaking so easily. They should improve the quality of that.,2

Stopped working after few months. Don't buy won't last long",2
Fingerprint not working properly it lags very often totally disappointed with the product,2

It is not for gamers,2
"Disappointing. Step count and heart rate is not accurate. Mi band 3 is doing better job.

Continuous heart rate enabled with 5 mins frequency. It shows 50, 60 at times. I am not an athlete.

If I do 20 situps, it counts 40 steps :(..why???

Measure manual heart rate. It says , dont move your hand. That's ok when I manually check heart rate. But when you go for outdoor walking, you will be moving your hand faster, how it calculates the heart rate then?

Just sit in a place. Turn on manual heart rate. Sensor will glow. You just move your hands up down little faster. It shows my heart rate is 120 and I am doing fat burn. Nonsense.

Call alerts and message notifications not working properly. Huami into this business for a decent period of time. I wonder why they are not able to get basic stuff like call alerts and steps count accurate!!

Display and lookwise it is fantastic.

If you are fitness conscious, then look somewhere else.
If you just want to show off, then you can go for it

Lot to improve!!",2
"Average headphones, their actual worth could be Rs.200. Its average lifetime looks like to be around 6 months, based on many reviews.

since there is no other product onine that address this category, i bought it again. but extremely annoyed by their lack of focus on service. for a new upstart, they should focus more on this. or bid bye to oblivion as more and more customers realize the service commitments.",2

Have been using it since Jan 2020... very low signal... i have used iball which is better than this,2
If u want brand name go for it... Normal earphones sounds louder and extra bass with the same price.. Jbl ear phones 600 or 700 rupees these earphones sounds louder and better bass than Sony.. If u find helpful.. Hit the like button,2

Defective piece crack on the corner of the phone .Microphone and touch not working properly .,2

"As this comes without USB port, this is not useful. I kept it aside without using it. waste of money. If exchange is available, it will definitely help me.",2
"I have purchased this product on 3rd October 2019. And after using it for almost 1.5 months I am writing this review.Overall it is a nice upgrade from Mi band 3 as it has bigger screen,music control,you can set brightness level and also you can set many wallpapers .But the biggest bug which i found is that whenever you travel by car itsumber of steps increases automatically Basically it increases the steps counts and distance which normally increases whenever you are walking or running .But in this case the steps counts also increases whenever you travel by car.This is the biggest bug a fitness band could have as this is the primary reason people buy the fitness band inorder to keep a track on their daily workout.This was not the thing in Ki band 3 .So my suggestion would be if you really want a fitness band that can accurately track your steps count and the distance then Mi band 4 is not the good choice for you.",2
Every time we need to synchronize from the app and notification is not working properly.,2

"Bought this at 2.5K in February. Was extremely happy with its performance till now as it was giving enough for the price you pay.
But now after 2 months it has started showing symptoms of fatigue. Needing restart to get internet.
Increase your budget and go for Asus.
Good things till now
5Ghz band works fine. Covers upto 40ft straight with 1 wall.
Gigabit ethernet works great.
Could handle 1 smart tv, 3 laptops, 4 mobiles at same time streaming and video calling without issues
Downsides
Gets heated up quite. In summer now, it's causing performance issue.
2.4Ghz doesn't work properly
Smart Wifi is useless, so disabled it.",2

"The product is not up to the mark. The sound quality is extremely low. In fact, one of the earphones had lower sound than the other. The overall performance is below average. Had to return it.",2
"Battery way too low
Camera is just ok
Display is fine
Doesn't have light sensor uses camera for automatic screen brightness",2
"Material quality is just like any other headphones there is nothing special or specific about this though its price is 400 bucks.

The cable is not tangle free like the boat 225 model. But a band is given along with the headset to keep it from getting tangled. This is the only thing I liked about this headset.

Sound quality I must say is the worst. There is added noise to the audio. I think the cheaper models from other brands like Philips and Mi headphones are much better in this aspect. Or it's better to go to the next variant in the same brand boat 225 bassheads instead of buying these.
Durability is something that I can't say as of now. As I haven't used it long enough to comment about it.",2
I have used this product for past two days and found that battery backup is not good. I really doubt on quality check .In My expreience this product is not giving me backup for router.Not sure why?. Quality of the product degrade. Same product i was using past two years it was working fine. This i had a very bad experience .Also when i asked for replacement i suspect same product send to me with new cover.Pls check on your quality,2
Poor sound,2
"After using fr 6mth what i can say its sensors r not propr nor giving accurate results have to cross chek wid other devices,whether it sleep traking,heartbeat,spo2.hav e to chek again n again 2 get the results ..i dont like it",2
it was working fine for first 3 months then started to disconnect aften. i had to manualy reset the router every 30 minutes to keep it work fine. Now its not even connect to internet...only limited symbol.,2
"Step accuracy is average, sleeping track and heart rate tracking is good. Battery life is not even average. If you do a activity for a hour then it's will reduce the battery 30%. So you have to charge twice a day if you are using all the features on the watch.",2
Radio is not working at all,2
"Lasted for about 6 months, n one after the other the ear buds stopped functioning.",2
Canon Camera not recording video for more than 12 minutes.,2
Router is very good but it buffers when you watch something on TV,2
"I am giving review after 3 days of using this product, There are many lags which I found in this like I am not getting call and msg Notification always, sleeping tracker, H.R and foot step counting is not accurate.",2
"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and found this to be very heavy in terms of its weight.
Additionally, the camera quality is not so good. The battery also lasts for a day with almost 1 hour of talk time.

According to me, it's not a good value for money.
I was expecting a better camera quality and battery backup.",2
"Not getting range full range in after 15 feet.
Not happy with range and no use if wifi don't have range",2
Worthless product. Don't purchase this.,2
"Not sure how this product got such a good rating. I walked around the house, doing some household stuff, for last 5-10 minutes wearing this watch.. It showed no increase in the feet count. Then I briskly moved my hand front/back for 10 seconds - it immediately showed 10 ft increase. Wav! I checked wearing another brand's watch on my other hand at the same time for testing. This watch fared very poorly. My simple mobile does better tracking. This watch is an useless product, so better avoid it.",2
The earphones are having a hissing sound now. After using it for 10 days or so i can not even replace or send them back.,2
"Pathetic wifi strength. Better you go with to link or d link.

With 4 antennas, it just covers my hall.
In my old house, i used single antenna tp link touter and it literally covered my entire house.",2
Camera quality is not as 13 mega pixel . Camera quality is poor.,2
Not a good choice.. exactly two months for today .. now it started troubling me...everytime need to switch off and on the router then it works for 10 mins or so... Better go for an upgraded version of dlink than this ... But the two months it worked absolutely well,2
"Battery and camera okay.

Hanging Problem and slow response....

Samsung to work more on this product....",2
this is the bad product i am not suggested to you.,2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Worst product it gets anytime disconnected and I would prefer not to buy this mi router ....buy tenda or other companies",2
Good quality better sound.,2
"Overall good, but not supported to my router since my router adapter needs around 9v and it has 5v capacity... want to replace but return window crossed... seeking warranty support now.",2
"It is weird that my upload speed is more than download speed for my internet plan 300mbps.
Also signal strength is very poor even in a 1000 sq ft house when you move away from the router to another room and close the door.
Not happy with the product after paying heavy price.",2
"Though I bought this a few months ago but due to certain reasons I installed it on 3rd January 2017. Airtel broadband installed it and can vouch for it. But to my dismay the power supply adapter stopped working on 13th January, just 10 days later. Please get it replaced.",2
"After using this with SONY MDR-EX150AP and CX180.
Sound qulity: cx180 lil bit driven by clarity, jbl lil bit driven by base, prefer sony because it has right proportion of base and clarity.
Mic: cx180 doesn't have mic others two have.
Durability: cx180 don't even last 3 months. One side stopped working, though I had repaired I was not satisfied with the durability. Sony and jbl are still working fine. Will have to see, both seems durable.
Comfort: Normal use SONY feels more snuggly and comfortable. JBL comes out often while you are using(I tried changing the bud with lil bigger one but it feels uncomfortable, I'm using with spare bud that's included with my sony headphone and now feels ok). CX 180 fits and feels well but not upto the mark of SONY but while sleeping CX180 is more comfortable because of its less protruding design.
***JBL- Other nearby people can easily hear what you are listening (slightly better when used with sony buds)
Price: JBL wins.
So you decide.
Update:
JBL stopped working both sides after 10months.",2
This colour photo bad printed but black and whites printing good,2
Normal,2
"Hardly printed 50 pages that to poor quality.
Not satisfied with this hp printer performance",2
There is write handset in description but in really handset not received in box 😡😡😡,2
"Cartridge comes with printer were duplicate seems, after print 10 color printouts it got empty. Very disappointed",2
Seems lyk I recieved a faulty product.. I walk around 11k everyday or 8 kms bt my watch counts it too less..it shows only 7k or 4 kms everyday... Don't know what to do.. totally dissatisfied,2
"-It's not that good.
-FM does not work.
-Sound is just okay, even much lesser than an ear bud.
Overall not satisfied with product, It feels bulky also on ear and not that good sound as compared to it's weight.",2
Okay product,2
"Product is good when come but after 3 weeks it's broken & when I called to customer care
Those are saying it's physical damage it's not our part.
So 1600 is waste.",2

Audio stop between the movies. Audio stop between the calling sometime only ringing voice is heard.",2
"Not so happy, I thought AMD processor is more powerful than i3.But after buying it, I am not happy with the speed of AMD. Very very slow processor!
Battery life poor,if open more than one task it hangs.Even restart is not working.You have press the power button for few seconds.",2
We are not satisfied with the product we have received product and the rotater was scratched and day by day color was peeling out if we try to replacement from amazon it's not happening it's really very worst 👎respond we doubt it as is jt original Or what,2
"Well 300mbps router should cover a house with 1500 sft.. But nah.. It just doesn't.. Sad but true..

Had to buy their WiFi signal enhancer as well.

Well it works 24/7 non stop without complaints.

That's the good part..",2
Works perfectly but until Battery is healthy. Mine is 18 months old and now only keep charge on few seconds so no longer useful. You need to keep buying it every time battery becomes weak. Should have provision to replace battery.,2
Range is very very poor. Good for a single room. Doesn't work across walls,2
I connected my printer to wifi then I lost my internet access. What is the use of wifi with no internet access? All the documents are in the cloud but I can't print them without the internet. I have to download the document to my local phone then connect to the printer for wireless printing. This is not at all a wireless print option. This is misguiding and not worth to go with a wireless option.,2
"I already buy this phone but not getting range clearly vedic call too much problems created buffering, reconact, paused, i am not satisfied what i do,",2
"Sound is good when you listening music but when you pick a call there is resound. some distbens while speaking don't buy ,it's my original review,bass is above average.",2
I did like the quality but as functional wise it is too slow. Hang some time while working. Having problem with my apple phone. App notifications didn’t receive. Really disappointed with this,2
When I connect my laptop through LAN it shows speed of 56 mbps and when i connect it with wifi it shows only 8 mbps even when i have kept the laptop very near to the router,2
"Got a faulty one. Imagine a phone without Camera app in it😃. Also many inbuilt apps like gallery, YouTube were missing. Placed a replacement order. Hope to get a good one this time.",2
Camera quality-camera quality was so poor both front camera and back,2
Not a bad,2
"Software needs so much work , will change review if I actually see updates. Try buying fast track or fitbit rather , this piece has a literal inaccuracy for steps and distance of 0.3%/km of travel , Blood pressure doesn't work but I didn't even expect it to. SpO2 and HR are the only sensor that works accurately. Apart from that the watch loses BT connection with the mobile ( OP7 ) pretty often , there are no automatic syncs . Also please simplify the app it looks like a cluster of things that don't work ! Your model of goqii points looks good on paper but its terrible ( Even sweatpoints failed as a company )
If you need accurate health monitoring watches , I'd suggest look for something else. I bought this for make in India but the darn thing is literally made and assembled in China. Please review this goqii , if u want data comparisons email me , but resolve this junk of data.
Again will change this review if I see software upgrades to make atleast step and distance tracking accurate",2
"different from what is shown online, product discription me Singal wire show ho rha tha jabki delivered product me old degisn ke tarha double wire hai.",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Just after 2 months of purchase only showing Display problem.",2
It's shows its 300mbps but actually its supports 90mbps only,2
the best part of this phone is very sleek in the model and handy lighter in weight. Worst part very very slow like an earthworm. I don't think its value for money...!,2
"The battery used is of inferior quality. It lasted only for 9 months. Like they mention, the warranty period of 6 months +3 months bonus is what a buyer should expect. I'm now wondering what I should do with this device as it no longer helps me during power cut. Couldn't find any provision to replace battery too.",2
Cheap quality of belt and we found small size screen so I prefer buy noise colourfit watch g jvhj j,2
"I faced issues with its brightness. After using it for an hour, I started feeling discomfort in my eyes. I have reduced brightness, contract and then also set it its brightness intelligence but nothing worked out. There was burning sensatio to my eyes just after few minutes of sitting. Finally I returned the product. Not sure the issue is with model or the product which I have received. I'm now looking for other brands like LG, samsung, HP and Dell. I just went for this model after seeing 10k reviews and overall good raring but I had terrible experience with the monitor.",2
nice earphone. I loved it.nice sound.battery backup good but not good for gaming,2
The inbuilt speaker is giving very low volume and poor quality... not recommended if you are searching for monitor with inbuilt speakers,2
Received already used product with many scratches and there is no security seal too..wireless on/off button is also not working. totally disappointed with the product.,2
"1. Product has premium quality(Durable enough)
2. Bass is good...(4 out of 5)
3. Vocals are worst(1 out of 5)
4. Honestly talking, SONY MDR - ZX110 are better than this...",2
Heart not accurate,2
"I have been using MI smartband since it's launched version 1. I used all versions.
Hence sharing vital feedback.

Band strip broken usually and it's plane matte finishing. Other bands provide good design and quality with additional clips at the end of strip.

It also counts lesser steps than other bands.

Version 4 has new features but steps workout counting is not much good as other bands.
Go for Fasttrack or Holyhigh for accurate measurements.",2
"The product works well initially. However, after sometime network is no longer detectable, and often reappears only after restarting the device from the power on/off switch.

This problem as persisted despite having reported the defect, and provided a replacement. Extremely disappointed with the product.",2
The quality of headphones was not good at all. It broke after using for 1 month. Also having problem for pairing with Bluetooth after connecting neither the sound was audible from the speaker nor the headset.,2
"Just after one month of use I am seeing internet speed fluctuation, not satisfied with the Signal strength at all. Initially it worked fine for a month and after one month of use now it is at par with my previous D-Link DIR-600 router. I didn't see any improvement after changing from D-Link DIR-600 router to this. All features are just for name only not in real output. Also, it is having heating issue from first day.

Not recommended anyone to buy this.",2
HABIT OF LATE ARRIVAL SEEMS TOUGH TO AMMENT,2
I m satisfied with this product but the worst part is black cartridge had finished after 20 pages printed...Why is this cartridge hp 803 finished so fast as I use it for my personal use...means not original....Shame...,2
"I had purchased this product for internet browing on my laptop assuming that this will work as hot spot data card. But when I installed, I came to know to avail the wireless wi-fi, one or the other device should be compulsorily connected to this modem through ethernet cable. When I summoned BSNL authorities to install this modem, they were having their own modem which was working like data card hot spot and they showed my lap tap can be used wireless. I have one D-Link modem earlier, but I wanted to work wireless wi-fi. Thus, the product D-Link DSL 2750 U is not satisfied. Kindly guide me how I can use it wi-fi without any primary connections through cable. Please tell me which model serve total wi-fi purpose without using any cable connections from modem to laptop or any other device. How can I replace this model?

Have been using since a month Good range coverage but wifi signal suddenly disappears or internet connection drops intermittently then have to reboot router,2
"Made with plastic,folding losses with time,plz don't take it.",2
"I got first product, found defective. It used to disconnect while I am talking call.. suddenly I used to stop hearing other party .. Also others used to say my voice seems to be noisy.. I returned and got exchange.. that product was more defective.. same problem exist in the second one, in addition I used to face difficulty in order to detect this headset from other Bluetooth devices.. I returned and got refund.. when I got both the time, seal seems to be opened little bit.. though I cannot confirm whether already used product or not.. Amazon should concentrate on keeping up the quality of products. Process of getting exchange and refund was quite easier",2
Phone charges speed is very slow. But as per feature it showing as fast charging mobile,2
"I used Boat before, I lost them so I got these. This is very delicate, it came apart when taking out from bag. Sound quality was not that good. Stopped using after a week",2
Sim slot problem.,2
"Very bad
Mobile automatically Restarting several times...",2
"Sound quality is good, but it’s not able to stick to my ears, buds design is not upto mark. Microphone is not clear, need to keep infront of mouth",2
"Product is good in terms of looks , but sound quality is not good as per the price, normal' 100Rs earphone is better then this",2
After one month of usuage I found the product is not up to the price we paid. Speed in good however the range is seriously worst. I stay in 1050sq house and my router placed in living room at entrance. I get week Signal at master bedroom when using @ 5Ghz but three tower for 2.4Ghz. I was expecting better from TP link for this price. Even I tried all possibilities to align the router for good signal but all effort went vein.... So pls think twice and read other reviews before you buy this product.,2
"Very poor battery's life.It's written that 20 days battery life...but that piece I have got,drained battery even after only 2-3 hours!!! I am very much disappointed. JUST BOUGHT IT AFTER READING THE REVIEW ...BUT IT'S TURN OUT FAKE!!!",2
"Battery doesn't stand fr a year after purchase.. need to replace d battery which costs d same price of the new one...

Pros:
Works good with power outrages.
Cons:
1. Durability : It's not worthy to buy such products which doesn't stand fr long-time.
2. 6 month warranty is less, atleast it should be 2-3yrs minimum timeline fr warrenty for battery replacement or service with minimum cost. Here replace d complete battery with d same cost of new one when it doesn't work as backup.
3. Cost is high.",2
Very difficult to connect but otherwise quality is very gud,2
"this is a product which offers you a lot of specifications with poor quality......the battery life is very low... they have mentioned a backup of 9 hours and it's not even giving 3 hours backup.
- It has got an inbuilt FM, which is great but all other specs. are just waste and I am petty sure that this product will get exhaust within 6 months...",2
"Camera is very poor quality
Battery backup below average
Fingerprint reader good",2
Build quality is not good.,2
"Sad and Pathetic display, also feels like camelin geometry box in your hand, everything is slow abt this phone, u can have a tough tine woth the pjoje display i wonder if these celebrities are using this phone :p",2
"Did not even worked properly for 5 months and costed 500 Rs. You also can't repair or claim your warranty as patron is only available in Bangalore and no where else. They don't even answer at the customer care and fool us around. Trust me, add 300-500 Rs. More and try to buy good brands like boat,sony etc. I regret my hard earned money spend on this cheap product. Also these earphone don't even have any bass and treble so not worth any penny from the beginning itself. Still if you want to waste your money on this it is your choice.... I'm just warning you with my experience!!",2
"High printing cost per page,",2
Sound quality is not good according to payable around.,2
Not good sound quality normal and low volume,2
After using 1 months it start hang.camera is good but not best.if you got helpful just click helpful,2
Front camera not good. Having blamish issue.,2
"Headset.Best quality of wire, Good sound go for it, But when we put it in ears little more slippery but sond quality is good with 1 year warranty, but i dont  read more",2
Always getting this error,2
"This product is good with build quality and look.
But when compared to other same features wi-fi its fail to perform.
I would suggest tp link router over this.",2
It is small not what I was expecting its good and all but i didn't like it and the app for the phone is good but it takes forever to signup the company doesnt even send the otp to sign up,2
With this price it does not have compass to navigate which makes some apps unable to use. Like sky watch. So disappointing. Even smart phone which cost around rs.6000 does have it.,2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I got this watch in the month of October. Watch looking nice. Its response is very slow. After using one month the sports mode in the watch is not working. I am very much disappointed with this. I got this problem after the return period is complete.",2
My product didn't even last for a month worst I guess it's a basic earphone and amazon cheats.,2
"I bought this instead of the JBL ones because of the reviews this got but I'm really disappointed. The sound it delivers is extremely sharp, so much so that you can't listen to music on full volume without it hurting your ears. Furthermore there is nothing extraordinary about the bass at all. I tried changing my sound equalizers as well but nothing really helped. Will be returning this most probably.",2
"It was working well for a month and then it started giving problems like it didnt connect autometacly and take too much time to connect and some time I even I had to restart the device in which the earphones was connected. After this in the 3ed month, one side stop working and I am here again to buy a new one duhh",2
"I was used many product of this modal but this one was disappointing me, after 20 days Jack automatically plug outside from phon, I try in many phon but same thing happened...
Now I can't claim warranty because Boat change their policy, you can't claim warranty online on anyone",2
"I was using a D-Link router prior to this and decided to upgrade my router to this particular model.Honestly I did not notice better range,reception,speed for the same set of parameters hence wondering why I paid a premium",2
It was working just fine until yesterday the left earbud stopped working and I can't hear a thing. And now it's too late to return/replace it. I just don't know what went wrong.,2
Mic quality is not proper,2
Camera quality is too poor.,2
"Used cartridge., the cartage was either used or it was empty. I was able to print only 10 to 12 color pages and while black and white so far I have extracted only 15 pages.",2
"I purchased this one year ago and I dont use them roughly,(I have a box for them). Within 6-7 months the left earbud was not working and then after some months the jack wire was worn out. I had to put black tape. Then again the right side was also not working. End of duration after one year. The cheap headphones from motorala,samsung are working from 3-4 years but sadly the materials are substandard and not durable.",2
Display not working and colour damage,2
The sound quality gets pathetic after a few uses not worth the money,2
Range is not good in 1m also. Bad product.,2
Don't buy.,2
"When i first time bought i didn't get the case to carry this but on the second time i bought i get the case to carrying handsfree, why the first time i didn't, not taking every order seriously. Bad thing",2
It has consumed 30% battery in single day,2
Not buy West of money this is normal watch value is too high totally west my money,2
"Pros:
Easy to install
Good User Interface
Good for taking loads of multiple mobiles, TV, Laptops

Cons:
Very bad 5Ghz coverage
With direct connection to Laptop LAN if you get 100Mbps+ then this router will cut down to 85-90Mbps. Atleast my unit is doing so.
Not suitable for online gaming with gaming consoles.

If someone is looking for more than 90Mbps speed then this is not the right choice. Netgear AC1200 can handle that consistently.",2
"The earphones are great and I've bought these same earphones before. This time I decided to buy it again because I prefer this company..
Everytime I buy this earphone it has a longevity of at least a year. But this time it didn't even last two months...I'm disappointed. I had a lot of trust in this company. Please don't degrade the quality.",2

"I have been using this watch from past few months.

+ve: looks attractive, fits better on wrist, not heavy, can download apps.

-ve: watch faces doesn’t work on iOS, google maps doesn’t work, battery life hardly one day, heats up during contineous use, can’t call or talk for iOS users, wifi connectivity fails frequently.

Overall not fit for I phone users. Forcefully have to buy android or google phone to use all applications.",2
"Product is not so good used 6 months
Color got fade also earphone is not supported in multiple phones.
Earphone cable is worst quality after using 6 months it is breaking.",2
"When connected to ethernet the speed got reduced drastically and often the wifi speed went down in a single day . when ethernet connected directly to my laptop i got 93 download speed but when connected through this router port the speed got reduced drastically to 50 mbps. first i thought it was network proble but after testing , the actual problem was with this router.",2
"Received the product today.
Screen size is much smaller than the product image they have put.
This review is based only for the screen size",2
"Battery backup is not good, battery drain so fast, it's dose not meets my expection, i order for bule and i get red.. What to say replacement is long process and i paid already so i kept the phone",2
"not so good in this price range, scanning time approximately 1 minutes per page, and b&w xerox timing also 30-40 seconds per page and color print also 1 minutes and above times. description wrong . don't buy.",2
The signal is not do strong and sometimes break although it works 100-100,2
product is already opened...as u can see.... they cello tape it....not good....,2
"The sound quality was not bad. However the headphones themselves did not last a whole month. Started off with the mic not working properly and then the right earpiece also stopped working.
To be honest in one word:Disappointed.
Did not expect this from a JBL product.
My streak with JBL products had been good until this earphone took it all away.",2
"I was using direct-Ethernet-Cable and was able to stream 1080p Vids with multiple tabs in browser.
Due to port issue, I thought of placing a router, so that I can use my phone as well.

But the speed totally degraded., I checked the configuration it is still the same.
I cannot even play 144p Vid on youtube if I have 2 tabs open in Chrome browser, and no other device connected.
(Internet speed is 5 MBPS tough) .

I had to place the router just in front of laptop on table. Now I can play 480p Hardly.

Now, I will try to fix the port, I think that will be better instead of this SLOW-SPEED / Blur streaming",2
I bought this for graphic design purpose. I regret buying it. The color balance is bad. It’s near to impossible to calibrate it correctly. Min brightness is too high to use in dark environment.,2
Looks are good but sound output is average. Go for JBL soundbar (investing 3-4K extra).,2
"I ordered and got a Mic Defect one and the replacement thing was used i think. The box was open from below.
Had to wait for 5days to get the replacement thing and return thing done and get the refund.",2
"I quite hate the mobile... Not physically but internally... If you are thinking of using this mobile for gaming forget it, cuz ur games will lag surely... Cuz it started lagging and many much bugs after only 3-4 months and all apps would start lagging if battery life is 10-20%... And I hate it... And also camera is worst quality... Also it's security is unsafe... And uses storage of mobile by 12 gb for no reason... And downloads useless Chinese apps without user's permission... I just hate this mobile... And also main problem. It overheats just like moto mobile, charger's quality is also bad.",2
"Not worth the price the sound quality is very low for a JBL product does not meet the standards.

definitely DO NOT BUY!!!!
INSTEAD GO FOR BLAUPKUNT EARPHONES THEY ARE BLISS FOR THE SAME PRICE!",2
It was quite good in the first few months but then it needs restarts frequently. Yesterday it just broke. Nothing works other than the power led which sometimes stop working.,2
Print speed is very slow. Size is huge. It occupied one small table.,2
"Product is great. Good range, no dropouts. Like internet active LED. Visibility of LEDs from low front also a big help. Allows high shelf mounting.

Could not find out if the firmware is up-to-date or how if at all, USB can support a printer. Response to e-mail tech queries is shallow, incomplete, passing the buck to call centre, no better, as quality of communication not considerate to a senior citizen. Finally got a networking professional on phone to help install USB drive.",2
"The hype about the network range is made so much but it doesn't deliver optimum as per expectations of wifi 6, AX model it doesn't cover barely 1300 sq.ft. also. Had very high hopes from this model considering online reviews and YouTube reviews. Ok for 800-900 sq.ft.
This quality n range you can get in much cheaper option which can cost around ₹ 2000-2500/-",2
I'm using last 2 months it is not a good product always strict in middle and need to restart it is not work properly..,2
"Don't buy these earphones
It stopped working after 5 months of use.
I registered a complaint to replace it
They came , took it & after 3 months they
Delivered new earphones.Also the new ones stopped working after only 2 months of use.
Just don't buy it.. waste of money",2
Back camera broken because of shape.the shape is not good .even we have pouch also its broken ..very bad experience .after buying just one month its good when i checked back.can weget product exchange,2
I like a replacement,2
"My purpose for buying it was to use it for attending calls, but it's not at all made for calling. The other person can't hear you unless you're talking louder and if you want to have normal casual conversations with it, you better buy some wired earphones. The sound quality is good for music.",2
"The accuracy is not correct. And battery is also not 9 days it is 5 days.
Should improve a lot.
Wasted my money",2
"My single antenna tplink router 2.4gh better work than mi

"Sensor malfunctioning,switching off immediately after sometime. Please dont purchase phone from amazon its my first and last purchase from amazon.",2
"Extra belts were removed from the box. It's not good for the prestige. Extra slot of box was empty when I opened the box.

"- The resolution is good but compatibility with various devices like firestick or even computers is not quite good. Cannot make the full use of the resolution.
- Colors are not accurate straight out of the box. It is very hard to set it.
- Menu/Software is not quite good to make the best use of the resolution. No manuals provided.
- Headphone jack is of very cheap quality. Audio out of it is CRAPPY. There is also a small delay noticed.
- Made of cheap plastic.
- For watching TV, even 10K worth of TV would do much better.
- Adaptive Response time is not quite good. Not smooth most of the time.
- NO RETURN is so ridiculous. Forcing to keep a inferior quality product.
- LG customer care of not quite prompt and does not sound knowledgeable.",2

Disliked - carriage finished in 5-6 pages",2
I have bought this product but in a month of order the printer burnt the tri colour ink and now I am not able to use it.,2
Average product. No bill present in the box. so I can't understand the product is original or not.,2
Sound Quality is good but Headphone quality is bad not fell barnded i use brnded product....look like ordinary product....not sony like,2
"It the worst router I have seen
Its wifi sugnal is very poor I have a wifi of 50 Mbps but this router gibes me a speed of 10 Mbps",2
"The sound quality is good. What isn't so good is the irritation you feel while it's in the ear. It's not at all comfortable. Especially the bud which is painful, and the ear adapter that slips off if your head moves.",2
Very bad chip quality,2
"I expected that JBL is renounced for the quality but I don’t know where was the problem, the sound quality was not good.",2
Ok but comparing to redmi 8a dual this phone is waste in camera and all,2
It's a whole lot if lies with this Useless router. You never get speed over 75Mbps on 5Ghz even when standing next to the router.,2
My Sony MDR headphones got retired in just 3 months,2
"Not as good as other reviews said about it.
It's an average product only having base product quality.Go for other companies earphones for this price according to me.",2
There is no fingerprint for the cell but battery and the camera is better,2
"This Wireless router does not work behind walls. Even single wall reduces the reacheability to almost nill & you can be always in front of router.
Try other routers so once you go inside any room, connection should not go down to nill",2
Before purchase I check clearly that this router supports 100MBps internet connection but . After getting it it’s giving 50mbps out put . Not much happy with this .,2
"the product did not have the facility of connector of internet ACT FIBER
THERFORE NOT USEFUL
for BSNL it is useful",2
"Not so expected level of sound, still it can be used for common sound system",2
Company has to upload all valuable software so customer will not run to customer care office.,2
"Better to spend some more money on an ink tank printer.
It took only 20-25 prints on the ink cartridge which is come included with this product.
To buy a new one it costs over 700Rs. However compared to the ink tank printer, you do not have to face this kind of issue.",2
Material quality is not got.. I have jbl flip 2 and it is worth every single penny.. I thought the same for this but didn't meet my expectation.. also wire break from the top point easily...,2
"Too many Useless Apps coming inbuilt which cannot be uninstalled. After seeing those many Apps, I decided not to buy any of the Redmi brand phone.",2
I was so looking forward to receive this product. I kinda liked it at first tho the wire was cut a little bit. The problem started 1 month later. Suddenly the tap button was pressed inside and I couldn't watch a video in peace cos of the disturbances it gave. I tried calling for a complaint but couldn't reach. Now in 5 months everything is worn out and I can hear from only one side of the earphone the left one isn't working at all. Totally disappointed👎,2
"Heat problem and less battery backup, hope this will be fixed in android update.",2
The router is bigger than my old dlink router but sometimes my ping get disconnected but the wired connection is ok.The wifi range is not as expected.,2
I do not like that very much. But as per the price you can not expect. Cheap material use. JBL’s scrap product.,2
Not so accurate. And blutooth connectivity is so much poor.,2
very bad quality product prom SONY. Looks great in image but in reality it looks like 100 rupees headphone. Quality is Vorster than non branded headphone. Being audiophile couldn't even like to listen it for 5 min. strictly no no for music. Good for showoff only.,2
"Good product & serves the purpose. Mobile app is easy to use but consumes quite some battery on continuous use. Fabulous display & easy to use. Cons - Even under normal usage the battery doesn't last for a whole week. Forget 2 weeks as claimed by MI, it's wrong. I have been using it since 3 weeks so can't be wrong. With Bluetooth ON the battery runs even faster. Don't know if this is a design flaw or intentional, but the device doesn't sit in a straight line on the wrist band. Check out the photo & you will realise it's not straight.",2
Bought in October. Already there are lines on display. There was no physical damage. Touchscreen was decent. Display was well lit even in direct sun. Expected better quality from Noise. Pretty disappointed.,2
Quality of Camera & design was not satisfactory,2
"so after using it for 3 months, below is my review
Got it delivered in couple of days. Design is very good. Light weight.
Have some issue with noise fit app as it get automatic disconnected. Heart rate and SpO2 is quite good but sleep monitor is horrible. Slept at 11:00 and woke up at 9:0(Sunday chutti ka fayda) but it shows only 3hr 28min of sleep.

Battery is quite good.
Charging is fast.

Overall good product but having some issues which can be resolved by updates.",2
The main issue is that lack of bass controls. Hence where you place is matter a lot along source inputs. It’s quite frustrating and I would recommend against it for this singular issue. Also sound quality is at best mediocre.,2
Speakers Acha hai but Sound quality bakbas hai,2
The sound is not coming from left headphone.,2
Normal ear phone can do this job,2
"1) Sound quality is not at all good, good enough for voice calls, online lectures, or watching videos, but not good for music listening or gaming.
2) Built quality is cheap (thin wires, looks delicate)
3) Bass is always good with jbl
4) swapping eartips is a nightmare, not at all recommended doing so. It has to be design flaw.",2
Signal always get lost,2
"No doubt of printing quality, but installing is really tough , and most important the given help line numbers and email address are wrong , can't contact HP executive from their given site . Feeling helpless.",2
"Good phone, u can use as secondary phone.. it will meet the purpose.. dont expect any high end phone features.. everthing is decent, but better plan for 3GB RAM phone which ever company you buy coz sometimes it lag",2
Poor sound.returned,2
Build quality is bad. The headphones clip holding the ear pad is broken within 4 months of usage,2
Printing quality is good... But printing cost is very high... Because cartridges have a very high price... Means 750/- for one... If u buy two... U almost pay the price of the printer... And the ink level decrease very fast... So not recommended at all...,2
"Mi band is very good.
Belt quality is not good.
Belt is broken after 8 month of use
Improve belt quality.
Watch is good.
As per the price belt quality is very very poor.",2
Initially this product is good and within few months right ear stopped working.! I've been trying out everything but couldn't fix it.! If there's any warranty provided I want a replacement for it.! Or atleast to fix the problem.!,2
Super product us me good,2
"The earpads are not very comfortable-not suitable for longer listening.
Coming to the headset per se-worked fine for an year and a half.Then the right side started fading and finally it stopped working.",2
"I HAVE HEARD LOT ABOUT THIS PRODUCT . I ORDERED IT AND DELIVERED PROMPTLY BY AMAZON INDIA. BUT MY ALL EXCITMENT GOES OFF WHEN IT MORE THAN TWO DAYS TO CONFIGURE IT , CUSTOMER CARE OF DLINK IS HORRIBLE,UN PROFESSIONAL & YOU CAN SAY WORST. NO INCREASE IN RANGE & SPEED. I DONOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY PUT TWO BIG EXTERNAL ANTENA WHICH UNABLE TO ENHANCE THE WI FI RANGE. RETURNED TO AMAZON INDIA.
OVER ALL UNSATISFACTORY EXPERIENCE.",2
Haevy,2
"It automatically stops showing notifications like calls and messages.
Battery life is good.",2
"Last week the router which i purchased 4 or 6 months ago burst their chip like you see in photos i called official mercusys india no satisfying comment tgey told me tell the technician department it's not our job
I wrote a email to mercusys official mail id but slow response no inperson contact nothing send an automated mail which doesn't solve the purpose is here any one who can tell me what to do with this router",2
recently got a beetel 150M router with Airtel connection and that seems to be working better in terms of internet speed.,2
Very difficult for set up,2
"unnecessarily costly. doesn't do much. may other alternatives present. got this just because i wanted a good fit for my mom. the sensors are also glitchy, rise to wake is screwed. mom's having a hard time.",2
Bass less although sound quality is pleasable.,2
doesn’t even print 200 pages in single cartridge refil,2
"Airbuds are good, but the left side doesn't get charge after 2hrs of usage",2
36 hrs calling in one charge...24hrs music and 12 hrs video,2
"It's a really good earpiece for its price and so I bought it again after using my first one for almost a year.
This time, less than 3 months in, one side is not working.",2
"I went for it after seeing reviews but most reviews are not genuine and overrated.
Sound quality is bad beats are not sounding good.",2
Send me damaged product,2
"Camera quality is poor, fingerprint reader is not available",2
Please don't buy this product waste of money and the saddest part is you can't return it... Don't every buy and waste your money in this,2
"Bass, sound quality superb but system got hang up after purchase of one week",2
Size is bigger than expected. Quality of product is not good. Printed name will erase shortly because of cheap print. There is no name or logo on buds. Its looking cheap. Thats why I returned.,2
"Things I want you to know:
1.It is not cost effective for long term.

Reason: The cartridges which they give (1 Black and white, 1 Tri-Colour) are not at all sufficient. At max, you will get 50 best quality printouts or 70 Draft/Normal printouts .

2. You need to buy extra cartridges which will print around 190 pages and will cost Rs.755/- per cartridge. Just keep this point in your mind.
3. In my case, the same day, the printer arrived, after printing 5 pages, all the lights started blinking and I had to lock a complaint call to HP. The technician came after 2 days , applied white grease , dealt with the cartridge placements and repaired the (new) printer!
4. You must take the extended warranty for at least 2years, coz you shouldnt rely solely on the guaranteed product.
5. The print quality will vary according to cartridges. But I must say, go for the wifi enabled printers [which it isnt].",2
Sound quality is poor ...after few weeks of usage the sound became unfunctonal from one side...,2
Sound quality was nic for first 15 dayss...an average bass is availableee... when i used max volumee my left speaker is now buzzingg.... i think the speaker is blown..... at an above average sound level our sorrounding peoples can also hear the music... but for price of 599 it is good among the available ones,2
"I bought this in 2019 from philips center and just few days back only... whenever I am connecting with Bluetooth and turning up volume,some kind of noise distortion occurred in left speaker. So I got it repaired from service center and again within 2days only the noise distortion started with the right speaker. I don't recommend this product nor brand.Infact invest more money and buy from Sony or JBL. These days, none of the products long last like earlier.",2
Refurbished.... Product be careful while doing online purchase,2
Sound is good ..But when u will sing using it's mic then ur voice will change..Now I want to return this product but I can't because it is showing only replace option .,2
Weight of product is too high.,2
"Not Satisfied.!!! Even in 2hbk it was not at all.covered with full signals.! Disappointed.!
Two stars for Router easy installation. (User Friendly)",2
"Go for a single or dual antenna as this is only hyped. I live in a 2.5 bhk house and was told a triple antenna will provide adequate signal in bedrooms. My broadband speed is 24 MBPS, so the problem is with this router.",2
Not the best but good enough but not that good stiLL fine not cost effective but wort lh buying....RIP,2
"I bought this item mainly for the attending meeting thru laptop. But it is not connecting to laptop.
Over phone, the Blue tooth is absorbing the outside noise and the other side of the person is complaining that I am talking from fish market",2
Print quality is very poor.dont buy.waste of money.,2
Sound Quality is not good,2
pedometer is not accurate also not getting notifications for iphone . customer care is pathetic,2
Not good in range.,2
nice sound . very low Bass,2
It has been 5 months since I have purchased this and one of the earphones has stopped working. The Sound is excellent but the quality feels cheap,2
"Cons : 1. Bass quality was so low even the sound quality was not so great as expected !!!
2 : headphones are so tight to wear. I thought because its a new product may be that's it is as it is...but NO ! cushions were not so good !
3. Mic and jack quality were also not good !!!

Pros : 1. If you want to hurt your head and ears, you can buy this product !!!",2
"Don't by this product, it is not available at product of exchange history.In future unable to exchange.",2
"When i was purchase this product i have lots of expectation but it is only for one room, if you are in another room or kitchen you will not get any wifi range so completely baste of money. After that i have using another router also purchased wifi range extender for this router.",2
It's old Samsung Hangover..,2
Quality not upto tha mark. Cannot hang the speakers as no provision for the same,2
"Not at all for clear calls. There is a constant background noise when I am speaking.
It is good for listening music and stuff but one cannot communicate over this. Very bad mic.",2
I bought this product last year on october 2.Product quality was good but after sometime its left side stopped working and then when i ask for replacement no one gives me satisfying reply even the customercare number by Boat is wrong and also it says no delivery facility availabe at my pincode,2
Ink consumption is very poor. If you are planning to take this you should buy 2/3 extra cartage for back up.,2
We all buy this printer as we think that it is at nominal price for household use and for children's worksheet....but we all befooled by company as ink of the printer is over expensive....the ink which comes along with printer is almost empty and hardly gives 20-30 copies. I m very disappointed.,2
"The worst thing i suffer is its size is too small that it won't even cover my ears, after 2hrs of use you will started to feel pain on ear. Not anything like ""EXTRAA Bass"" just more than any cheap earphone.
Pros- tangle-free n long wire.
Cons- u cant even realize 3D sound, just left n right.
Result- u can buy such quality headphone in low price",2
"Audio issue, it gets mute automatically for some milliseconds, also clarity issue.",2
It was good but I don't received memory card... It's a bad experience with Amazon.. It's a ethics that Amazon need to check to every vendor.,2
I had problem with my Printer after a year randomly switches to maintenance mode can't use the printer for printing at that moment so scheduled for HP on site support team to check the issue. two guys arrived and printed some test pages told me all is good with the printer and they don't see and issue. If problem persist they will have to replace the mother board and that will cost me more than actual price I purchased the printer. Interestingly I was charged Rs750/- so just press button on the printer and it was just for 5mins.,2
It's good in this price but the processer is not be good,2
Not That much base..sound quality is bad..,2
I have purchased this as an alternate for my Mi 3c router but it disappointed me. The wifi signal range is not half of my old Mi 3c router. My second reason for purchasing this item is video streaming on my Android TV but I was upset here also.,2
"No so good.
Echo problem while using with TV. Better invest some more money and go for other one.",2
Waste printer,2
"There are issues connecting the device with phone and keeping it connected. Step count is incorrect and it keeps counting even if you are driving. Build quality and display is OK. If you don't want coaching, then this product is not for you.",2

"Was fine,not met the expectation",2
"I wanted to write review after 3months of use but forgotten since one year to write. This product, made in China?, offers good sound quality with not much bass but you would enjoy the overall output. Quality of make is just average, after 9-10 months of use with 10hr use per Week, handled with care for fear of breaking poor plastic, still ear piece foam came off. With worn out look it was just lying in cupboard since 6months. Felt bad and dissatisfied. Sony can do much better!!",2
SpO2 reading is not accurate. It only for step counting and fashion only.,2
"After couples of months it will from one side,
Sound and bass quality is A1 but the product is not durable cheap quality plastic slider has been used",2

Was terribly disappointed with this. No exchange is being offered.,2
It's not working good printing issue and no customer support.,2
This is not an 802.11ac router. See attached photo. Wrong information on the amazon site.,2
Been 6 months. Got the problem. No more power supply. Adapted got the problem.,2
"Mobile apps are not working properly, heart rate not working properly, sleeping Accuracy also not working",2
This is the wrist product . After few months it has stopped working from left side. Don't buy it .,2
"Battery drains away, in 4 days
It's given as 10 days
And it's non returnable",2
Average . price is too high. Very funny to note that amazon boy doesn’t accept my exchange mobile. Very small problem in mobile. Still he don’t agree. Little bit disappointed,2
"Really bad quality wire when compared to Boult earphones , it broke and when compared to Boult , just skip it , these guys are just milking brand with celebraties.",2
"I posted this post.. after using one month...during this one month two time hang....i need to restart that time ...full.battery charge time is more than one hr ......really cheap and irritated as now a days provide charger 30 w but ....company privide 13 w.....really unhappy thing.....as i compare with other screen resolution is cheap again......i usef last redmi note 7 with cost nearly 12k ....not satisfied compare with that .....first time i used samsung phone .....but really not satisfied......i purchase on fisrt with excitement but now i loss the feel......sorry to say....but its real.....turth is truth.....

Good things from my side....touch....some more featues like samsung pay.....security setting ...

Remaining nothing change with others....",2
"Absolutely wrong figures shown. Sleep tracking is terrible, the step counter is completely off, the heart rate monitor wrong in every reading. But it's good for motivation while running on the treadmill. It connects very well with the phone and notifications are good. Overall, this is not a product for accuracy, but motivation while working out. I would return it if I could.",2
Didn't liked the sound of this earphone. Bought it considering JBL brand but it was a big disappointment. Basic earphones which comes along with phone has better sound quality.,2
It automatically disconnects and connects with so much difficulty,2
The tech support of TP-Link is worst. Push notifications are not delivered whenever I connect to my WiFi network. TP-Link was not able to help me with this issue. They cut the call twice after guiding with modifications in settings that didn't work. I sent an e-mail to them. But they neither replied nor called me to assist me in fixing the issue. I was still in the return window when this issue appeared. But I didn't return it because I don't like the seller to bear losses because of the defective product manufactured by TP-Link.,2
The mobile phone is getting switch off when I contact the hotspot with my laptop WiFi.,2
"Average sound quality...reviews and description are hyped...

Tried different sorts of songs for testing frequency response and clarity...
Clarity is not at par compared to cost..removing most of the sounds having > 4000Hz freq...
312Kbps song will be sound like 64 Kbps...

Bass it, ok, but it should not be the only criteria.

Returned it and buying SONY home theatre",2
"This watch can fulfill your Health matric requirements. But massege can't be read. Instead of reading whatsapp etc texts, its shows on notification that your massege account change😏.",2
"LAN ports are 10/100 Mbps so technically you are always capped at 100Mbps max speed even if your ISP provides more speed than that. In my case i have a 200 Mbps conmection and my speeds are capped at 100Mbps. So no point of buying this if you believe overall speed over router is 1350Mbps.
Coverage is good and provides consistent maximum speed of 95Mbps on 5ghz and 80Mbps on 2.4ghz",2
"Amazon pay didn’t accept for this phone
Not bad",2
Software CD Missing,2
Networking issues & banging mobile,2
I received the torn package. It is already used product. 2 hand product delivered. Also I thought it is indian product. But it is china ka maal. Also it doesn't fit in ear. It slips out by its own. Does not support in vivo phone.,2

"Amazon has lost its trustworthyness, nowadays. They are cheating the trusted customers. This mobile is not worthy for its price and it is a basic one. When trying to return on buying a new version, customer is denied of this facility on some flimsy grounds.",2
"The modem looks good, it has got 2 antennas and good spec as compared to dlink on paper. But in reality, it is the worst. My dlink single antenna modem(2015model) had good wifi signal strength as compared to this latest tech. The wifi signal just loses if I switch just one room. It is pathetic. Also, the wifi signal stability is very poor. The signal is like a sine wave. Sometimes good signal, sometimes fair signal, sometimes poor signal, on a constant location without any movements. Also, it has got poor heat dissipation. The only plus so far I came to know is easy to install.

Deeply regret the purchase. I had many expectations like my old dlink had limited coverage and with this, I can use in good condition. But it is worse than my old modem.",2
Sound is Good But not good as Sennheiser CX 180. Earbuds are Irritating due to Its Design. It is Not durable My Earphone Stop working One-side within a year.,2
Mobile heats within 10 minutes of call.,2
"The only thing I was expecting from this was sound quality and good bass, but m deeply disappointed.. the sound is very much unclear to elaborate its treble is not good & and bass is not at all upto the mark.. I wonder how people has given good reviews for the sound quality or probably I have received a clone or faulty headset.. returning this item for sure..
Also, tried pubg with this headset and again negative feedback .. I was looking for the enemy at my left while he was at right hand side lol..

Talking about the positive point: it’s plastic quality and overall build up quality is impressive! I have given 2 stars only for its appearance..",2

Cartridge is costlier and gets damaged frequently.,2
Very poor product and quality,2
Mic is not working and niw It's useless. Need to replace. Product is under Warranty.,2
Product is not up to the satisfaction.,2
Weak signal. It's not even for 2BHK . Application is not updated. Look wise it's amazing. But not worth it as per the amount and specifications.,2

"It's hardly been a week or two since I bought the watch, and yet, it doesn't sync well with the mobile app, and it needs to be restarted and troubleshooted with various methods to make it work every now and then. And, this reflects on various features like the movement sensors to display the time without manually touching the watch, or even for the message and alert notifications that is activated to be displayed on the watch. Even syncing the watch with music also disconnects and needs to be reset or connect every other day to make it work. Irrespective of all these, Noise make sures that they push all the ads about their brand as fixed notification, and that sucks. Overall, very poor from a well established brand like Noise.",2
Hi All! I received this product on 8th Jan 2021. When I started using it I realised that watch is showing 5km Distance covered and when transferred to Strava it was showing 4.5km Approx. after 10 days suddenly app started updating and transmitting to watch. but it got stuck in between and watch stopped working. after complaining to service center they arranged the Blue Dart to pickup my watch and sent replacement after 10 days. Still the new watch is not tracking the accurate distance as compared to Strava. there is an always difference of 500-800 meters. Also to enabled GPS takes 5-10 minutes on watch. Not Very satisfied ..... Even new watch got hanged during updates .... sending for replacement now as they dont have refund policy ... useless ...dont waste money,2
the Product itself good but very bad service from Amazon,2
"Some time connected fail in band,in day two to three time. After software updates in mifit App than no problem band connected. 👍",2
"Upgrading from a N300 router, i thought this router will give me a good range. But alas.
In my 1320 sq ft flat, it cant pass one single wall and go to my bedroom with teh door closed.
returning the product",2
ok product,3
Best looking,3
Not user friendly,3
"best sound quality... but noise cancellation is not good as expected... if you are buying it for recoding videos , i must preffer earphone of better quality of more cost.... but at this price i think i justifies it's price....
only problem is it's hard earcuphs.. as a student i purchased it for lectures and it's hard earcuphs hurts a lot after 3-4 hrs of regular usage.. otherwise it's justifies it's price....",3
Overall the Phone was overpriced in this (8999/-) Price point...,3
Battery drains faster even when data is off and recent apps cleared.,3
These headphones are comfortable and cancel noise. The music output is pretty good but it is still muffled to a great degree. These headphones are not equipped for watching movies or videos with people speaking at all. The sound of a person speaking is reduced by a lot so it's a pretty bad experience for movies.,3
Simply ok,3
Little problem with accuracy but overall awesome product from mi,3
Easy to install. But too costly.,3
"It's just a simple earphone having a brand stamp on it and selling it at 649.
You can either go for boat earphones which are having a deeper bass.
If you want to enjoy music and for playing games then you shouldn't go for this.
Instead you can go for boat earphones in less than 500.
SO IF YOU ARE A MUSIC LOVER LIKE ME THEN DON'T BUY THIS",3
"Worth the amount
...... Today after 2.5 months my boats one side got silent...... Go for mi earphones.. They are far better in case of wear and tear and durability... My mi earphones had durability for abt 2 yrs",3
Watch is all okay.. No issues till now.. but the app for this watch which is Noisefit app is just worst.. it was good only for 2-3 days then it started creating problem.. my watch record my every activity but it didn't showed up in the app so many times. I do workout daily in 4 sessions so i want proper record and sometimes it doesn't show 2 or 3 sessions and some i lost the whole day activity.. i complained about that to the app costumer service on whatsapp. So they came up with a temporary solution that is uninstall the app and reinstall. And when i did so in the middle of the day i lost all the data.. from app and watch too..,3
Just a so-so mobile phone. Suitable for average daily usage. Camera and battery are just average.,3
Colour Ink cartridge not working,3
"Battery is very good
Performance is good
Front camera is good

Back camera is too bad, not worthy, even its not a 5mp camera at rear.",3
This product is not working just within a week unfortunately return window has been closed. Is there warranty period for it or can I get it replaced with new one.,3
Berry good battery life,3
Size of product is to big for any home,3
Quality of speakers not good with Bluetooth but nice with lead.. Overall it was good experience....,3
Good smart watch value for money,3
"Something is seriously wrong with the router.
I was trying to use this router in combination to another TP-Link router I have and somehow this product misbehaves and the speed won't go beyond 10 Mbps. My broadband is 50Mbps but the router starts with a genuine 50+Mbps and suddenly drops to 5-8 Mbps and stays there no matter what.

Amazon replaced the item with a new piece and this one is working pretty good. But if you have too many devices and want performance I would still recommend higher performance AC750/AC1200 routers.",3
The sound is very muddy. I was expecting better sound. The product was faulty when arrived so had to return it once. Not great value for money. It's a Made in China rebranded product. Instead of this buy B&H or Creative or something else. Philips is ripping money off just because of brand name,3
"Prier i have use note 5 pro
Note 9 is note working like 5 pro
Lagging problem",3
"For those who are using BSNL broadband, please dont buy this product, this is not suited for BSNL. Otherwise Amazon best delivery and quick delivery. For BSNL use only D-Link",3
Going to unfair with Mobile .... multiple times,3
If possible don't purchase this product,3
Average monitor in this range.,3
Good for buy,3
It has been just 4 months but it got broke several times in those four months. I fixed it many times but it again cracks from another side. Finally it got seprated and now I have to use like this because 1400rs 😅.,3
This product is fine as it does not give very high as mentioned in description. The signal become weaker after crossing 1 or 2 walls. I don't recommend you to buy this one.but delivery is appreciable,3
Product is fine for the cost spent. But package and delivery is bad experience. Package has been covered with transparent and tape. Cart box is broken it reveals that delivery is not handled properly.,3
"The product was not given user guide book and also guarantee, warranty card. That all thank you",3
"Weight of mobile is very heavy .don't prefer ,other than it everything is good",3
"Not OK for the price, not sturdy. Already tears in the edge.",3
Performance is good so far using since 2months,3
"1)Camera quality is not good...My old device redmi 7 pro has best quality compare to redmi note 9
2) low performance compare to redmi note 7 pro
3)in paper redmi note 9 specification is. Good but practically they r so bad... Because of optimization..",3
Ear gets hurts after long usage,3
The camera quality is very poor. it doesn't appear 48 MP. The phone is thicker and heavier than other M series phones.,3
i m not happy with this product,3
"1. Camera quality is good
2. Battery initially seems getting exhaust fast
3. Finger print little slow
4. Price wise looks Ok....",3
"Okay,from its cover that's looking duplicate not, original sony headphones, sound is okay, not best ,I'm not happy bcz i was expected lots of from sony headphones👎",3
"Noise cancellation ok,
sound quality below average,
Bluetooth amazing.
Bases average,
overall nice.",3
Sound quality is decent...but u can't compare this with Philips speakers... Philips mms 4040 and mms 4545 speakers are much better than zebronics in terms of Bass and sound clearity,3
I would definitely recommend this product as value for money with best functionalities. However in 2018 faced one technical issue and got the router replaced as it was within the Warranty period. But I still satisfied with the service and it's usage.,3
"I like the detailing which is given in the watch
Dial is too small",3
print quality is good but later on it going to be expensive in terms of maintanence and its ink cost is too high. overall not to buy this product if you buy for personal use but suitable for commercial use.,3
Need improvement in steps count and battery backup in this device,3
"Main problem is on off button.
Some it open quickly sometimes it takes too much Time.

Some time this device do not open pressing.on button.

No digital screen in this price range very sad.

Printer is light weight.

Printing quality is good.",3
When I started using these headphones initially felt that worth for price...but later on during the usage I found that it's not...Sound distribution and quality are not up to the mark,3
Pixel density is low with macbook pro. If you want to read text then go for higher resolution. Good for video streaming.,3
I received damaged package. But product is working as of now,3
Battery life is ok in medium use. Sometimes theres is disturbance in sound otherwise its good. Noise cancellation is good.,3
Average product . Ok to use,3
The phone with massive 6000 mah battery give you ultimate nonstop 8 hour of gaming and loses only 100 to10% but problem is 15w charger which charges the phone in 2 hours 45 minutes and heating issues but all is OK overall good choice,3
"Just average phone
This is not a negative review but true
Only good for calling message and simple whatsapp use
Slow battery charging
Just 3000 mah battery drains fast but charges slowly
Overall good value for money
as this is only @ 5999
Not so costly
Not so powerful
Not so amazing
Not outstanding
Not so impressive
But overall average phone
Good for the feeling of having a smartphone but not up to the mark",3
It was nice but after 4-5 months i m not able to take calls from it,3
"Front camera quilty is very bad
Just like 2mp .।। 😟",3
"mostly i want for training purposes ...but not accurate information about the training ,i did 10 k but it shows 8.2k ....so not use of this watch..bp n heart rate also not showing accurate......",3
Range is good as expected.,3
Sound is just ok at this price. No issue with connectivity. Not meant for music lovers. Also it looks like used product has been delivered.,3
This mobile is nice but there is a problem in it when I call someone it couldn't call then I have to reboot it and then it works I have to reboot it at least three times in a day . It's the major problem in it but the camera and battery life are superb. There should also be a fingerprint scanner. I give the mobile three stars from five stars .,3
Its good but the battery is not more good but can be use as the price is low,3
"Battery performance poor
Charging taken 2.4 hrs
Fast charger wrost
Overall battery poor and phone looking good but system performance very poor or wrost quality",3
life of inks of cardridge if we dont not use long time,3
So bad manual book not found but phone is super,3
"Great Product..
Major benefit of this product as is low cost ,better features and build is also good
Wires are of flat type so i can give its build quality as 3.5 .
At such low cost ,ptron providing such great earphones is bit of extraordinary work by them.",3
Nice but some times struck,3
It is very difficult to remove from the strap to charge or something and it looks quite small compare to the others like fastrack new version... 3/5 I would rate this product.... But other than these the features are extraordinary....,3
As mention in the product manual for warranty register process but I tried many time to do but failed to do.,3
"Colour print is not better..... Lining print...
All colour pages lining print..... And esy to use and install........",3
Mobile is ok.. Camera is very worst.. Nokia 5mb cam is Better quality than this.. Bad quality camera 🖕👎,3
honestly you buy it for the rgb thing and not for the sound.its awfully quiet for what it is but at this price point something like this is a steal,3
Not worth.This is not fast charging. ...,3
"Packaging - Bad (Though the item was fulfilled, Amazon?). After few days of usage; okay phone. New software.
The battery does not feel like 6000mah; last 24-28 hours on low to just mid-level usage.
A heating issue with 20 mins of YouTube watch and a notification is displayed that the device will be automatically turned off due to heating (while charging).
The overall company wants to earn with this without much bothering about the value proposition.",3
"Product is good, but battery backup is not good, also camera quality is avrage",3
Not a good quality phone,3
Camera quality is very poor. Display is not up to mark. Video quality on youtube and storage is not good.,3
"Music disconnection in every 5 Sec.

Worst product",3
Little bass n hell of treble...Suckss,3
"It's not working properly don't waste your money, everytime when a i end up with call then it shows call notification, incoming call notification not working properly else good,
even i replaced it",3
Heavy weight,3
Good. But it is not taking the default password to configure the device. I am unable to reset the device. It is not working. After calling TP-link customer care they are telling that no executive will come and fix it. They are simply telling that I need to take it to the service station. Not satisfied with Customer service.,3
Its ok..,3
"Very slow mobile phone, it was expected because all the Samsung mobiles below 10k are not good.",3
Sound and bass is good but couldn't survive upto one year.,3
Its an average phone. 6GB ram is just to write. Speed is not that much fast. In just one week phone started getting slow.,3
"After 3 month use I write the review

Cons
1.After 30 min Earpain start Which Not Good For Watch movies and PUBG.
2.If your volume 50% the Sound over outside

"It's 3.5/5 overall (considering the price point)
Music - 3.5/5 (not great, but fine, not good for bass lovers though)
Functions - 3.5/5 (remove from ear and put in case, still connected to phone which is bad)
Build quality - 3/5 for case and 4/5 for earbuds. (case rattles a bit).
Call quality - 3 (noise to the other person, keep your volume very low to resolve this upto some extent).
Range - 3 ( can't go above 5 meters if wall is obstructing).
Gestures work fine. Giving 3 stars to lower the rating because it doesn't deserve above 4 star",3
This is worth for 599/-. I got this product for 599 from Amazon and it's best for its price. Go for it.,3
"It was really so tight for ear i Only used headphones for like 2 hours and then take it off and the pain man i only now the pain

This mobile Camera 📸 quality is so bad both side.,3
"Bought 2 years ago for some 1800, its 2.2k now.Product works as described, but is expensive for what it does. Makes more sense to buy a basic APC UPS. APC works for longer and has replacement batteries. APC one is 1k more, its will work for at least 2 years based on usage and replacement battery is around 1800. Can use for other devices also as capacity is more.",3

Very weak signal. Disappointed.,3
Display is not up to the mark,3
"Okay okay for daily use but bass is not so great.Its a simple headphone that does it function. Not good with bass, or noise cancellation but who needs it for such a price.",3
When full app notification is on battery life is 3or 4 days max.accuracy is also an issue as margin of error is greater than clinical instrument finding..but barring this it good to have this to be aware of fitness regime,3
If you are going with this camera then fine but you can't use third party additional flash light you have to bought canon flash which is costing more than 20000 so I prefer if you want to use it with additional so don't buy it otherwise for normal purpose at-home it is fine,3
After 4 months..sound comes from only one side.,3
Not at all up to the mark of the quality and the Brand. Looks attractive but doesn't serve its purpose well,3

"When it works, its great. But that is exceedingly rare. Paper just keeps getting jammed over and over again. I am honestly trying everything I can to avoid having to get a print out because of the paper jamming issues.

It broke.,3
"I got defective piece,the sound was not coming from left side speakers.",3

Quality of the product is top notch but the range is not so impressive.,3
"Printer cartridge not available and ink refilling not work well. Better to buy ink tank printer.
Not working now due to ink cartridges.",3
"Pros:
It is light weight, good graphics and configuration.

"Canon and Nikon have been the leaders in the camera space they have a lot of models to offer and it is always confusing to pick the right one.

Today I am going to compare the best selling canon 1500 d to the nikon model mentioned below.

Check the link
https://amzn.to/2TBTvUJ

A different kit
https://amzn.to/2UQD8DP

When you compare the 3500 available at the same price the canon simply feels dated, the Nikon has better battery, the difference is not marginal, the battery on the Nikon feels much superior, the maximum iso is also higher and with a large pixel area, I feel the comparison simply feels one sided.

With bluetooth and phone control the Nikon is a much better deal
Both the cameras lack an articulating screen which is sad considering how useful it is for Vloggers.

Design and build

The level of quality is impressive from the Japanese brand. Everything feels well built and the buttons have a tactile feel to them. With a decent display, well laid out buttons and compact body this one feels very practical to use.

This does not feel super premium, but it isn't supposed to feel like high end cameras to keep costs in check .

Performance and image quality

This is what got me a little disappointed, don't get me wrong this is an absolutely fantastic camera in isolation, it offers great image quality, low light performance and decent performance, but when you put it against the competition it feels a bit dated.

Conclusion

A good camera, but not my recommendation at this price point. If you want a camera only from the house of canon check this one out.

My recommended canon 1500d kit available at a very good deal, discounted price.

Hope it helps

Good day!",3
The quality is good but not sustainable. Wire got stretched and 1 side stopped working.,3
Woofer system is the very good,3
Standard product.,3
"Reviewing after using for 2 months.

I expected its performance to be much better going by the reviews.

It comes up with several connectivity issues every now and then.
5GHz bandwidth is a joke. Only 2.5GHz works well.
Looks decent.
Installation is neither difficult nor easy.",3
Spo2 measurement option has been removed and sleep hours is also not getting measured properly,3
I gave 3 ratings only because I realized that published specification of this router is incorrect. You say the processor used us Qualcomm and I believe you and bought it. And this is fact using Mediatek chip. Otherwise this router looks OK.,3

so so.,3
Bass was good but volume was low but gor 10×10 room is suitable,3
"bought it for 3199. the noisefit app takes up a minute to connect to the watch, quite irritating. also the app is in developing stage so we will have to be patient with it might take some months. the steps tracking is accurate for long haul walks and runs with out even taking your phone you can if you want to have very accurate data but without phone too works almost the same. for bike ride and workout mode or pretty much any other mode it sucks. sleep tracking is the worst so i use my mi hrx band for it. touch interface is a bit lagging sometimes. battery life is good as i don't use it that extensively. music play back and all other features works ONLY when you properly connect it via app just turning on the bluetooth won't work. i was able to see the display in bright sunlight too on medium brightness. overall feel and looks are excellent in 3199 price range.",3

APP connectivity poor",3
"I have switched to smart band 4 after using band 3 for more than a year and writing this review after using smart band 4 for 15 days. This newer version has got more features and obviously a better display. U can customise the watch face and can even place ur own images. It looks great on the wrist. I have used it during swimming n cycling also and it works like charm. Sleep monitoring though is not that efficient but yes outdoor activity tracking, heart rate tracking and step counter works pretty well. Only issues that i have observed are screen is very much prone to scratches so be ready to put up a screen guard. and other one is that mi fit app is too cluttered. (but yes u can sync with google fit. issue sorted 😉)
Hope u ppl find d review of some help. 😊",3
In 4k more better option available,3
This product doesn't have built in speakers so i dislike it. Should i change this with some other model having built in speakes? Please advice me.,3
"Overall an average product not that great...
Signal strength is just ok not that great as they mentioned on the package...",3
Dislike,3
Even I turned off the auto brightness feature still display light fluctuating (dimming & increasing light).,3
Camera getting poor day by day.. it was not clear.,3
Monitor stand is longer than regular monitors. It should have been adjustable,3
"Battery back up is not as shown 8 days. And also BP monitor also not accurate.
Apart from above the product is best.",3
back light is not good.,3
All is good as long as it lasts. My pair got spoiled in the 3rd month itself. Not at all worthy of 349-399 coz it worked as good as a Portronic I got for my child at 149.both lasted 2months only.,3
"It's nice ,not bad not good..just nice...my brother using it and he liked it",3
Okayish watch,3

"I feel below things are good

1. Design
2. Camera quality
3. Easy to install
4. App
5. Can talk in speaker
6. Alarm

Note: Poor customer support, When I send mail to customer care, they replying very late more than 10days

I don't like because
1. Software has some bug
2. They can provide more feature in app
3. Delete option not there to clear any specific date video
4. Loop video recording not working for me
5. Format memory card is not working through app.

I am using samsung 124GB class 10",3
Goood dual band wifi good coverage,3
I bought this hoping it would cover my 2 bhk house!! Little did I know it would only cost me more but would not serve the purpose. I was using a single antenna router which gives me same signal strength as this one. Only in terms of speed it is good not for large spaces!!,3
Just ok for a wrist band. Everything is not that accurate. Band doesn’t sync wit app most of the times. Heart rate and sleep monitor shows very approximate values. Never shows any naps i take in between the day. Sometimes notifications come in chinese. Pros: Excellent battery life since its been only 3 weeks of usage nd gud it comes with magnetic charging.,3
"The phones ok for the price . But is very slow at moments , the screen is decent and camera is poor",3
This machine is very good printer,3
Camera is not good rest it's an average phone,3
It is a good device,3
"Alice for money
I got it in 3.5k
Look is great, light weight.
Oxygen reading, heart beat, sleep tracker is good.
Bluetooth range is 3-4 meters only
Doesn’t calculate correct distance while running, accuracy 67% only.",3
This product doesn't perform as premium as it looks. You can find better monitor for the price. Picture quality is really dull to a point where you can see the pixels on the screen. Design wise it's the best in the market for the price range but the picture quality is bad. I've used other dell monitors which were really good but this one disappointed me.,3
My main purpose for buying this product was to improve the signal strength since I live I multi-storey house. But sadly I didn’t find any significant improvement compared to my older two antenna router.,3

Freesync option is disabled. Highly disappointed.,3
"Affordable and relatively easy to set up.
However, the range is not good enough for a two-bedroom house. I get a very, very weak signal in the bedroom. If that could be improved, this would be a 5-star product.",3
Looks great but works average.. Quite slow and the connectivity to the phone is not good,3
Sound quality is not so good and bass is not OK also when opened box the sub woofer front pannel was damage as not handling properly,3
This look just ok ok. Signal strength seems not good. My previous linksys wireless router was much more efficient. I would say this can be skipped and find better one. I bought in emergency as my wireless router was suddenly dead.,3

✅Processing speed is SLOW* also sometimes it hangs too.

color ink also makes good quality paper wet and deformed shape.
i am okay with this just for using to print papers for reading offline. it may not suit to others for regular home use.
it is also very bulky and heavy than shown in.pictures.

It is difficult to switch off the printer sometimes. The printer does not switch off even when the power off button is pressed. A paper tray should have been provided.,3
Today I received this phone. Everything is fine but picture quality is not up to the matlab. Rest I'll update after some time.,3

"I Overall like this product but One thing that frustrates me is the MIC . {{The mic volume is too low you have to shout if you want others to listen to you.}}
{{ So if you are buying this for something that includes talking and communication ,don't buy this one.}}

Headphone looks good..Sound is crystal clear but Bass is limited..Good sound with low bass.Bluetooth connectivity is good.Overall Product is good but if u are looking for High bass and woow sound headphone surely this is not the one ..Price is also high as compared to competitors product...This product should be under 1000..,3

Isn’t the memory card combined with the order? I didn’t get the memory card,3
Overall mob is good. They say it has 32gb storage available but when u get the mobile due to all internal apps u get only 20gb left. Never felt lag Or hang due to multie use of apps. Os quite ok. But worst thing is camera. It's almost same quality as some keypad mobile. And they have done a frod saying it's 13 mp but only 10 mp!!!!!!!!!! with badquality. And photos do not have shot on redmi. Exept camera overall decent mobile,3
These headphones gave good sound clarity and bass when i connected them to my pc but when i connected it with my mobile clarity remained the same but the volume and bass were on lower side,3
Printer is not showing black ink level after filling ink and often it does't print even after black filling ink.,3
Original cartage very costly and print 70 to 80 pages only,3

Sound clarity is good but there's no bass. Ear pads are also not much comfortable so I suggest you all to go for Jbl c300si or t250si both are same. I have t250si and it is lot better than this sony product. Bass is much more and padding is good too.,3

some good points
1.Battery is awesome ...its back is great on standby
2.camera is ok ok.Not natural colours its over saturated
3.Look is acceptable at this price range
now the only bad thing is
1. its processor ...although it is clocked at 2 ghz but this phone is definitely not for gaming purpose.
even clash of clans is not wrking smooth forget pubg.
for running pubg you have to on the game turbo and still game lags a bit ..frame drops are very high sometimes.....so guys its upto you ...never trust a media tek processor for gaming...and specially under 15 k phones

after the first system update all the above issues have now been resolved....battery optimisation for stand by is now awesome......and biggest of all...pubg runs smooth without game turbo..i am happy now ...peace",3

No CD will come with this pack u need to download the app from Microsoft's store by logging in.,3
"So the product looks good and works fine, but to get a 5 star they need to work on a lot of things
1. In build quality the button in the side feels cheap on clicking which could have been improved
2. Very less options for watch faces and most of them show only time and date, not even steps count in watchfaces
3. The watch Bluetooth keeps disconnecting randomly
4. Now coming to the biggest drawback which reduced the rating of this product it it's application. Even the cheapest watches had better app, but the noise for app is one of the worst for what you pay for. Ful of bugs, UI is ok ok, logs off randomly and also hangs badly, and I'm using a latest mobile phone. And on the updates and dashboard view, don't ask me. They have a long way to go when it comes to mobile app",3

**IMPORTANT - I was searching for Made in India product. Seeing the manufacturer details in this product section said it is Made in Verne, Goa. This is not true, it is purely Made in China as per D-Link package box and this product has been imported by company in Verne, Goa.
Do not cheat customers giving wrong information in the product details.
I had to continue using it because i am in need of this.
Also the couple of images of the product is wrong, it's not the right product.

Amazon has to check the credibility of the information provided by the seller and should also include Country if origin soon.",3
"Its good for beginners, has almost good tracking accuracy if not perfect. Been using for 10 days, I noticed something odd or not sure if I am missing something. The workout tracking when i turned on from app was working perfectly with GPS, however when I started the same from the band it was totally inaccurate like ( within few steps it was recording a km ) and gets disconnected frequently. Battery backup is not great as advertised, the charge percentage falls even when band is idle (this was not the case with HRX version i used earlier). Battery holds good only for using steps calculation. Using workout tracking, changing watch faces, heart rate monitoring etc seems to be draining the battery a lot. Yet to check Sleep monitor. But atleast the magnetic charging us helpful compared to old charging mechanism which was frustrating. Its overall ok product.",3

"A classic case of misleading marketing, while the packaging boasts of up to 1350 Mbps combined speeds, it comes with a 100 Megabit WAN port, which caps your maximum WiFi speed regardless of what plan you get from your ISP. So no matter what plan you get, the maximum speed achievable is 100 Mbps only, not the 800 odd present on the packaging.",3
Sound is nice but the wire quality is average as you'll have to be careful all time because you cannot use it harshly as the joint might get damaged as its a straight joint not an angular one..so these earphones must be for those who enjoys sound quality as regular person might damage it in a month or two.,3

Ok so this Earphone is basically good. But the wire around the jack/joints is really vulnerable to damage and will make it unusable (just like mine). Its been only 4 months and sike! It is dead. Please note that this review is just me placing my opinion about the product that I am(was) using.,3

Price wise ok. But problem is of refiling. It is not accepting the refiling cartidge. HP need to take care so that the printer accepts the refiling cartidge in order to facilitate customer.,3
You can not set bandwidth limit of your connected devices only you can set device priority. This is a very basic router feature. Don't know how TP link launched this without proper bandwidth control,3
"I have not in mind to buy chinese phone, but samsung models are not good and costly too. So i buyied this. It has network connectivity issues. Lack of proper video call and network hotspot connectivity. Hotspot range is too low about 2-3 miters. Camera is also average.",3
"Bluetooth disconnecting again & again, hence sleep tracker not working properly. Everytime manually pairing has to be done.
Call notification activated in setting but not showing in watch.",3
"average one, effective range 6 meter radial",3
"Speed in very slow
Installation is difficult
Quality of print is great
Build quality poor",3
Bluetooth connection is not that good,3
2 speakers are defected they are making bad noise,3
"Sound quality is ok. During calls the earphone makes irritating high pitch sound when the other person speaks.
Noise cancellation is good. Mic transmits voice with good volume.",3
This product is heavy(200g). And it hurts my ear some times leter. Its not comfortable for me bt sound quality good.,3
quite good,3
I would like to request Mi to improve the pedometer function in the band by the software update. The pedometer doesn't work properly and shows false data. Otherwise everything is very good. The quality is very good and the Mi Fit is very accurate. You cannot definitely this product at such a reasonable price. Go for it.,3
I have returned the item then how I I can review again?,3
"Screen is bit small , I feel its overpriced..not so much features..screen size is very small",3
"Good battery backup,average camera but no fingerpint reader.Nice phone but think it's cost is high",3
The product should have a return policy instead of only replace policy.,3
At first the performance was very good. But now after using for around 8 months one side is not working. Really disappointed from a brand like jbl,3
"Nice one..but after 5 months, it's mic not worked. Then, requested for warranty.. I got new one.",3
"First of all samsung did best....but plastic built quality is low, cameras 📷 Okay, call quality is good, yaa overall a decent product from samsung.",3
"Awesome headphone to listen music, wrost microphone, can't use for voice calls",3
"this product colour exchange company .l like navy blue but recived white colour. No fingerprint medium camera battery is so good
But rate this product 8299 rate high .in this rate hieup best product.this is medium quality mobile phone.",3
"The product in general is excellent. It is superb in installation easiness and pricewise also much less, although the it does run out of ink pretty fast. I have purchased the 2621 in March and the within May the ink (Black) ran out, where as our consumption would have been barely 50 pages in 90 days. And, oh! boy, the cartilage is costly.",3
"One of the most important purpose for which I have purchased this is 2 way audio. This is not happening. I do not know if this works for other. Remaining features are good - like easy to install, Motion detection and Night Vision.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a revised review :
I am missing
1) Saving to cloud feature, In case of theft of the camera itself, this could provide clue - who, how and when stole it.
2) Noise cancellation is bad. So lot of surrounding sound is picked up during two-way call.
3) Following a moving object feature is not there.",3
"Excellent accuracy , value of money right but Chinese smart watch but battery weak and dull",3
"It's a good product with respect to budget, but then it started lagging the very first day. It keeps lagging till today. Instead of buying this pay extra 1-2 k and get Redmi Note 9 pro which is much much better than this. Was very disappointed when u started using it",3
"Withing two weeks, the white wire started getting blackish lines all over. Also the sound has mild crackling noises at times.",3
"I can sense some fault on my product. on the right side verge of my product that is the adjustment area, I found the product lost its grib which is very important part in it. so I would like to replace this product asap.",3
Heating issues and very average battery life,3
Everything is awsm but not good comfort little bit feel tight on ears,3
Nice printer but a costly deal if you are using this for many prints. Ink cartridges are costly and even they are not easily available ( Specially the black one ),3
"Average product. Not a very great listening experience, but ok. Not worth the price, may be the brand name seems a bit exaggerated with the product.",3
"It is good but steps counting as much accurate
Else it is good in 3500",3
Gluco monitor.Good things.,3
Bought on 7 July......nd now it's 29 August nd one earpiece is nt working,3
"Camera quality is not up to the mark, even pictures quality are more pathetic than two lenses camera.",3
Expected to be better. Users can go for it's updated version. It costs just few bucks more.,3
The battery life was good until its first updation After updation battery performance is not good,3
Sleep tracking is ver good,3
it got some prob within 10 days of purchase .. quite dissatisfied .,3
This printer print quality is very good but this printer in cost is very high build quality a very very awesome,3
"Good one, but I gave 3 stars for the Quality. You will get a very good Sound Quality in Sony for the same price Rs.850. Not sure why JBL charges so much for this quality.",3
Poor sound clarity while making call.,3
"Everything is awwome except battery life.
Battery sucks in just 4 days",3
Looks great but performance is not that great as mentioned,3
Remote connectivity feature is not good. Planning to return the product.,3
"Biggest problem is that no straps will fit. Other than the original obes supplied with the box.
Could not find any decent ones on Amazon",3
Not up to it's price,3
"I was using boat bassheads 225 for the past one year and I thought of going for the same brand again bcos of the great bass experience it gave me. unfortunately, the mic of boat 225 got repaired and went on to purchase this new product only for the mic but the boat bassheads 100 is not at all half the potential of its predecessor. totally disappointed. treble and treble only. I can't sense bass or whatever in this new earphone even at the lower volume level. ppl should not go for this product if they prefer bass and quality.
besides, the mic placement is awful. most of the ppl today prefer to wear their earphones around their neck. the mic placement is made in such a way that goes behind the neck and attending the call becomes uneasy.
the button on the mic just acts as a play/pause button rather than call attend/disconnect button.
in short, a total waste of money.",3
The steps accuracy is terrible. I actually walked for 5 steps and it showed an increase in the step count by 21. That’s not how it’s supposed to work.,3
"Tenda F3 is good in performance, but little bad in outer look quality, but affordable price. Working great..... Signal range is good, easy setup.... Nothing more to say.",3
good product.Not Bad product,3
"Sound quality is not good. Maximum volume is too less. Many features like split screen, screen recording not there.",3
Wifi signal is not strong enough,3
Clr is very sad ....,3
Finger print sense is litle late compare to other phone. Camera not bad. Battery backup quite good. Phone hangs some time.,3
"product is good for the calm or relaxing music lovers but not good for modern youth due to average bass and noise cancellation.
also if you have greater than an average size ears then these can give you pain regarding their fit!",3
"Four antennas is a gimmick,it is not suitable for broadband with morethan 50mbps speed",3
Some software issues,3
"1)Sound : soft, not so high, its average or normal
2)Bass and terrible : Not available
3) Bluetooth, Aux, usb , sd card slot, fm : good
Remarks : i cut 1 star for ""Sound not high"" & 1 star for ""bass not available"".
Recommend :(a) for low budget : this is best
(b) for high budget : purchase only branded product",3
"It doesn’t have a mike. It’s not comfortable for office purpose. For entertainment purpose, it’ll be good.",3
Frm my prsnl point of view i can't make sense as to y this product is having such a good review where the company assures it with a very good 10mm driver feature to which i practically found my Boult earphone at a very similar price range to be absolutely working much better in base unlike this one... choose any other better Boat earphone 100-200rs more than this one... don't buy this!,3
"In this price range sound quality is extremely good, not look like cheap, but while calling another party getting extreamly noisy voice ,which is very much eritating.",3
Not so attractive,3
I like this product. Iam using this product to applying for job and for that I want this scanner and printer.,3
"Strap has torn apart. I wonder that MI have made it like that, so customer can bough new straps. i having huawei band has well. But Strap is working good till now. which i bought 2 1/2 Years back.",3
Pl provid customer care bec print not a proper copy so pl provide installation,3
"Please donot buy onsitego warranty with this product because these guys do not have any knowledge about anything, whenever you will ask any question to them they will simply route to the Brand.

Best we should buy plan from Brand, at least they will answer all your questions",3
OK SOUND IS NOT ENOUGH,3
Print header needs to be replaced after 1.5 years of use which cost you around 3500/- ..also don't go with additional warranty from Onsitego as their services is pathetic,3
This mobile is not good.display and camera quality is very bad.,3
"this product is good performing, but only we feel 1 problem that its range is down when 1 room to another room, if we try to access from another room then it shows very week & low range.",3
"Noise cancellation is absolute zero. I brought this earphone so that I could talk. But the microphone is not bad that is mostly picks up external noise than your voice

Disappointed with JBL.",3
Good product in this price range sd it sipports wifi 6.,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I like the watch activity trackers are good, display quality can be improved",3
"Range in my house was not enough, reached only to the 1 room next where router was located. I've big area house, but when used in my second home, which moderate in size about 350 sqft. It was fine.",3
"Don't buy this product if you want high bass
Overall the product is worth buying at this range",3
"Have been using it for 2 months now, so far so good!! Network range i feel is too less. No heating issues evn if used 24x7.",3
Good sound quality and look also good iam satisfied this sound quality,3
You shouldn't buy it because printing cost is very high you can buy a new printer in the cost of two ink cartridges...dmmm wasted money,3
Not what I was expecting stopped working after 2 weeks. Extremely disappointed with this one.,3
"First of all no body likes to write a forced review, however here's my review after using it for 15 minutes.
1. Sound quality is okayish
2. No complaints regarding comfort
3. Bluetooth range is adequate
4. Build quality is fine for the price
Update 1: review after a few days
5. I am often noticing lyp sync issues with Netflix, YouTube and VLC, video lags behind the audio
6. Hearing a beep sound for every 10-15 seconds once the charging falls below 40%. It's almost impossible to focus on the audio with that distraction. This is not making any sense to me I mean no one needs an alert at 40%, suspecting that the percentage might be fake.
7. Can't use for more than an hour, ears are paining a lot.",3
"1) Purchased on 17th Jan 2021. But the screen has broken like car glass after a slight fall from my hand ( about 2 feet) !!
2) Poor audio volume ( Ear piece ) during receiving or making call.... (Audio improved after the phone fell !!!!)
3) I have been a mi & redmi phones user since 2004. and recommended these phones to atleast 1000 people....tBUT THIS TIME I AM DISAPPOINTED A LOT!!!",3
Low cost printer. Working good. But the cartridge draining very fast. For every one week need to change the Cartridge. It is very difficult.,3
short speeker wires...no baas n trouble jack...quality Ok type..looks decent,3
"Sound is good , you get what you paid for dont expect too much. But left and right profile is very bad, gets same audio in both sides.",3
"Style and comforte is good but
Bass and vocal is not good",3
Too much weight,3
TOO MUCH UNNECESSARY INBUILD APPLICATION,3
"These headphones just lie in the middle ground they sound just ok, less bass and empty sound stage but good connectivity and usability.",3
"EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT FOR THIS PRICE (LG)
but this is not all borderless as they mentioned there is an extra black out around the bordeR.(This is not gooD)
the display quality is good with IPS but there is an grey out on the screen, not pure black.",3
"Battery life very poor, less than 2 hrs",3
First day I'm really disappointed for buying this .it is too hard to install in laptop but through otg cable it is easy to install in Android mobile.i ordered 1112 series but I received 1110 series wid the duplicate lable.packing and delivery is good.. performance is average.,3
"Works well with Mac OS , Easy to install !!

Received one colour and black cartridge with printer !!

Print Quality is okay !!

So for I have printed around 50 A4 colour pages seems colour cartridge going to finish need to refill , because new cartridge costs half the price of printer !!",3
Got an open package. The wifi SSID had some one else's name,3
Drinks too much ink. Non economical compared to other brands,3
The number of Colour prints we got are very less than guaranteed,3
Like you and thanks,3
Battery life is average,3
It's suprb,3
Doesn't really sorry high speed. Switched to Asus dual band and getting much better performance,3
I had purchased it on first sale the accuracy of this product is something that disappointed me the steps are been calculated while I was riding my bike and the heart rate accuracy when I check manual it's fine but the automatic heart rate tracking is completely inaccurate while workout MI needs to fix this ASAP via update Battery life is ok gives one week with all the options enabled,3
It's showing on your app that it has been picked up. But the product is still with me,3
"i'm using this product for tracking heart rate, stress and sleep predominantly. Accuracy is decent as i have been using similar competitor products until recently. Strap quality is quite flimsy - can do better. Please dont get carried away with the 14 day battery life. I had to exchange this product once so far, since the battery life was just 2.5 days against indicated 14 days, which is totally not acceptable. Replaced product is again no good interms of battery.

only consolation is the price. For INR 2500, its a good buy as a start / introductory product into the world of fitness trackers. Nothing beyond!",3
AFTER UPGRADE IT WILL LOOSE CONNECTIVITY FREQUENTLY.,3
"If you want a watch with a good design which feels good at hands then go for it.
Spo2 was near about the same or you can say more accurate. Got the same results in my oximeter.
Heart rate monitor was also upto the mark giving near approx readings.
Stress management , sleep monitor results also seemed ok to me.
But, I had one issue with their ios mobile app which doesn’t connect the watch immediately(it takes some time) and i have to turn on/off the Bluetooth 3-4 times to get the watch sync to the device.",3
Well constructed but limited use. The so-called Prime day sale was a farce as I later found the price was the same as on any other day.,3
"the build quality is okay, very easy to install but the connectivity and speed is very bad i had to refresh it every morning. very bad experience for me.",3
Nice product but damage speaker,3
"These buds are designed for Bass The mids and lows are slightly subdued but much better than many other buds. After all it is JBL. The fit is not that great. Also the wires are too thin and I wish they could have tangle free flat wires instead

Pros: Best bassy sound
Cons: No volume buttons. Mic is not so good. Thin wires",3
Print NHL kirrha hi,3
Camera quality is below par.,3
"Signal strength all over the 3bhk apartment is good.
But takes time to link up or reconnect if the connection resets.
Troubleshooting is confusing.
Even the admin setup page is confusing.",3
original cartridges which only print 100 pages cost 600 rs - only buy if you're willing to gamble with DIY cartridge refilling,3
Nice product thank you Amazon,3
good.,3
"I noticed that the vibration intensity is very low also compared to mi band 3 ,. Rise to wake not sensitive compare mi band 3,. music control this option not useful me can control with earphones. Charging system not good",3
"It is not as good as my Netgear router. I have done PPP configuration for my Act broadband, unlike those netgear router which used to indicated a new email or message comes on whatsapp automatically, this router lets you pick your devices and have to do refresh the screens to check your email, which is a big disappointment.",3
It has power button and display issue. Now Amazon is taking to much time to exchange it.,3
No finger print. Just below average phone. It's good for an average use. But its Worth of 7500. Good for online class. I think no other company gives 3gb ram and 32 gb memory with 5000 mah battery and fine camera quality. With 7500 rs,3
"It's a normal ADSL router. Nothing too much special. Range is only a bit more. ... IF range is not an issue, any cheaper ADSL router will do.

Thanks",3
"Hi Guyz,
It is more of suggestion needed than review. I am facing an issue where in my wifi gets disconnected to my TV and mobile very often. Currently advise what settings to be updated to make sure it works smoothly.
Thanks in Advance.",3
There is no fingerprint scanner. This is a big drawback. Otherwise it is a good phone for basic usage,3
"Almost all features are good, but call volume is very low, this is really necessary, hope samsung will fix this in next upcoming versions.",3
"Touch screen is not good ,overall performance is OK,",3
At first the watch feels good on wrist. However it is just second day of purchase. I hope the watch delivers what the brand claims. Fingers crossed !!!,3
"Base is the only fluctuating parameter. Aspects other than base in the audio are suppressed by the very high base(sometimes disturbing). My expectation were high from JBL headphones, which did'nt fulfill.",3
There are no directions as to how it could be used as a repeater. Had to return the product as i wasn't able to figure it out.,3
Sound quality delivers below average. Volume is very low.,3
Product is good but there's not givened from remote,3
"Overall it is a very budget phone.In 6799 it is offering 6.5 inch screen. Screen is good and HD. I don't expect much from this phone as I have gifted it to my wife,so no need of high end multitasking and speed performance but its front camera is very disappointing during night. It shows very blurry pictures in night. The dot dots are very much visible while taking pictures at night, just like a classic phone cameras of 2005 2010. I have used many MI phones ,the cameras was upto the mark,but this time its very disappointing.
I was so disappointed with the camera that I ordered replacement but I cancelled it soon for not taking the headache of setting up the phone again. I think it wasn't the single piece defect. There's a degraded quality front camera in redmi 9A. In daytime there's no issue but it is not meant for pictures in nightlights.",3
"Its very comfortable ,and perfect for gaming in budget....but the bass was very average and it's definitely not a good headphone for basslovers.",3
Sound quality is good but wire feels like so cheap..,3
I was surprised after seeing the features that so many features in this budget it's amazing to use...,3
boat basehead100.Nice on at this price but improve packing. bass OK. sounds quality normal. over all ok,3
Sound loudness was good but no control for bass look was decent,3
I stay in 2bhk flat and i have fix router in middle from where i can get strong signal in both the rooms. But here its big disappointment with this product. I hardly get 2 bars of signal. After hardly 5 month it stopped working.,3
Only Railway Time working for Customized Template. Music volume option not working. Call mute option not working. Heart rate and workout monitoring very poor. Waking and sleeping calculate is good.,3
"Suitable for AMD graphics Card user who wants to use free sync. Picture Quality is alright, Sometimes when on High brighness and high refresh rate panel gets heat up a little you can feel heat on the outside case, No protect whatsoever for eyes except MATTE FINISH which helps by not reflecting or refracting image or light falling on it. But in terms of eye protect It provided none. Causes Eye Strain in long Use. Affected my eye sight Have to use minimum powered glasses with Anti-Glare coating. Better Buy no power Anti-Glare glasses before start using it.
It was cheapest in the quality thats why I bought it because at first I needed it for occassion use. Better invest more money If you are gonna use it for long time or gaming, get some high range Product.",3
The watch is over all good but the screen time us very less,3
The mic dosent function properly... There is disconnection in between the call,3
"It's OK. Sound quality is not even close to the premium products. Bass is just up-to-the-mark. Treble is good. Vocal is very low pitched, sometimes even not audible.",3
Sound is great. Issue is with the design of product. It cause pain to ear while using more than half an hour.,3
Using for 2days.... Okay product,3
"I was brought on Oct 2019 smoothly working but , some problem on colur but I brought on RS1000 blinking problem was common problem it will solve essay just remove the dust on the chip of cartridge and fit on there and close and open the door constantly while the blinking stop .",3
Don’t have much brightness during the outside usage. Each time have to tap on top the device to know the time.,3
Very bed perfomance of camera plz dont buy this mobile,3
You should also provide earphone.,3
The wifi range is not as expected from Dlink. I am comparing it with Dlink router only.,3
I have printed at least 50 pages or less the ink is finished so early,3
Sound is good and bass as well but it doesn't work for long time. My one side of the earphone has been stopped unexpectedly.,3
Dr morepen.the machine do not show the readings/figures.,3
I didn't get installation help also printer is not using black ink may be setting problem,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Camera quality not upto the mark",3
"Cables are somewhat tangle free.
Base of loud but it destroys the original intent. Like it dosent suits 90% of the songs.
Music is not balanced at all, mids and highs after not clear at all.
Noice reduction is great, earbuds are comfortable, metal gets wayyy too cold in winter.",3
"After 7 days of use I'm writing this review: It takes a long time to charge and heats up a lot, sometimes it lags to pick up incoming calls, many mi apps are still pre-installed in the phone(even after update they weren't removed), only the camera quality is good, honestly it's better to go for other brands in same price range as they offer better performance.",3
"Biggest drawback - cannot adjust the height and the power cord is a little short.

Everything else is very good - picture quality, no glare, blue filter, brightness adjustment.",3
"I don""t think that pupil purchase set because figur print reader, and camara quality extreemly good, but he want that phone have long life with some smart feature also.",3
There is no fingerprint censor,3
"Been using for 10 days.. it’s weird I’m noticing that I don’t find earbuds comfortable in my ear over a period of 1-2 hours! I don’t know, never noticed it to be an issue with my apple earphones or AirPods.

Want to change now, but too late! Colors are good though",3
good price and design but has little bass.,3
"Please do note that it has no microphone.
Sound quality is just decent.
If you elevate your budget a little more you can definitely find a better choice.",3
"It is some good and some bad
When I was taking a copy a white line was appearing on the copied page.",3
Its really awesome but cost is to high and Cartige are very high rate....,3
Accessories not available in box,3
It looks good but quality of print is bad... It was not a good decision to buy this machine,3
"I purchased a JBL C50Hi ear phone on 24th May 2019.
I found its sound quality way better than my previous ear phone.
But it's not very reliable. Because within 8 months mic stopped working altogether.
and sound level has reduced considerably on the left ear phone. I am currently only working with the right ear phone.",3
"On paper, the device looks great. It is a low cost head set which does lots of things. my past experience with Zebronics have been good so I was excited for this headset.
What I got was a used piece, with its wear and tears. Supplier was : Appario Retail Private Ltd. It was quite disappointing. It appears due to lockdown and subsequent limited quantity available, Amazon is unable to provide quality product to the customers.

Why i prefer Amazon is it is able to supply in times when one cannot go to retail stores to get the device. but if defective product is the what is going to be supplied, there is no point in continuing on the platform. I urge Amazon to improve the quality of the product delivered.",3
"You will need to restart the model every day for it to give full speed.
Has bandwidth control",3
"Cons:
1. Very bad camera. Selfie camera is not even enough for video calling.
2. Performance is not up to mark with 3gb RAM.
3. Heating problem with extensive usage of internet or gaming.
4. Many unnecessary apps which cannot be removed are impacting performance.
Pros:
1. Very good battery life.
2. Nice display and well built.
3. Budget phone.

Overall, it is a budget smartphone with less smartness. Lot of notifications which are unable to remove with many unnecessary apps in OS.",3
"Camera not good
Speaker sound not good",3
Good product at this ₹2999,3
Sound quality does not match the expensive ones,3
Baise to Samsung mobile ki picture qality bahut achhi hoti hai...pr samsung m42 5G mobile me aapko uski qality bilkul theek nahi lagegi is price range me to bilkul bhi itni khatiya qality ki ummid nahi thi...mujhe bahut pachtawa ho raha hai..kaash ki Samsung ka koi or mobile le liya hota....bs ye na liya hota.,3
First off all base is not good but it is OK in this rate. But the second thing is that if you want to listen song in some higher volume sound come outside and this higher volume is not that high in actually mean. I don't know weather the problem is in my device or not. But as far I think every device of this product has this problem.,3
"I have purchased this product in the month of May' 2020. It has 2 years of warranty. Now,Wifi router signal is getting hanged. I have to plug out the router for 10 minutes in order to get back wifi signal.

"They are not connecting to my phone, after long tapping on it, it is saying ""its safe u first need to tap the notification "" pls solve this issue",3
"Bass too much, cant enjoy in that bass, treble bit low .. Cant judge by the reviews, you actually have to listen to its quality before buying. Some may not like it.",3
It is okay.Ok but not much,3
"The product is a bit laggy. Not what I expected, I gets disconnected often and doesn't pair with app immediately. Sometime the app has difficulty in connecting with watch.

Display is clumsy when navigating from one to another screen.

Raised a complaint with noise and got only another replacement 🙃🙄. But no answer for device responsiveness.

Lift up display has a good 3seconds delay. Not acceptable for a provide like noise.

Overall the phone is better not good or worthy for this price.",3
"Within 8days the headphone broke
But sound and others are best",3
"The earphone has good sound quality but somehow, I feel I got minor pain on my ear holes after having them for long.",3
"Too much bass...but does not have these qualities.
1. Very less or little streo music.
2. No 3D output.
3 No Treble reducer.
4.sometime there are two different types of music sound in a single same song.
5 No warranty By Harman international in india. It give warranty only in 2 or 3 country.
so for batter music experience you should go with samsung or sony earphones",3
"Bass quality is amazing and at a medium or lower volume the vocals are pretty clear. Sound quality was not compromised even at higher volumes. But the reason behind the 3 star rating is the build quality, which is awful. I was well aware of the fact that the build and plastic quality won't be too notch at this price range but there are other on the ear headphones available in the market which offer relatively the same sound quality but with a better built. The main plastic band and the joints are extremely flimsy and we've got to be extremely cautious and careful while handling them.",3
Overall good product but Camera is overlapping in this Camera,3
Speaker is average. Sound is not crystal clear. Bass is good but treble is not controled.,3
Print quality not good and scanner was not scanning the document till the end of A4 size paper. Top to bottom of A4 size paper not printing,3
There are an issue in colour cartridge after 45 days installing although I didn't take colour print,3
Nic product but consumption of cartage is more.,3
"less accurate.
go for honor band 5.
low price and spo2 monitor in honor band 5",3
Satisfied with the material,3
"Just got the phone in hand and the phone started lagging the next day.
1- Performance average.
2- Camera Average.
3- Bit heavy and bulky too u can feel that.
4- Design poor or should i say worse.

I have used this product ...at this price it's performance is average...not bad...,3
Wifi signal weak। Range not even 20 feet।,3
"Glucose Monitor Dr More pen.Nice produuct
...",3
Product is average quand accuracy,3
Product not worth if u are looking for quality. Uncomfortable experience won ears. I wont suggest to buy. If you dont care of comfort and quality then you can go. Please note you can decide later as there is only “replace option” . I didn’t notice and now its waste for me,3
some disturbing sound is coming.,3
"Not worth Rs.3499.
Performance:- First of all, there is no sleep tracking. There are 9 sports modes - walk, run, treadmill, bike, hike, climbing, workout, spinning, yoga. There are No Call functions, No Camera control,
Battery:- Lasts for about 10-11 days which is a good thing. You won't complain about battery anyway.
Quality:- soft silicon belt is nice and no problem with the skin.
Display:- little scratches starts to appear without protection, although with me using it rough, it is nice though.
Disadvantage:- I bought 2 of them(1 for my friend) and the firmware version in the watch is different for both even after update. I had multiple customisable dials options available in one watch, while only 5 fixed dials in the other one which is really disappointing.
Final verdict:- if you're first time smartwatch buyer, it is better than your analog and digital watch but not a real smartwatch as it misses out many functions. Would suggest you to increase your budget and get a real smartwatch from fossil, oppo or apple.
Also if you're still looking forward to buy this wait for sale, the price drops significantly.",3
Works OK. Setting up is non intuitive and a a bit tough with so many different drivers on website and then it shows multiple menus from which one has to select,3
Good sound but quality of ear drums not good.,3
A GOOD PRODUCT IN GOOD PRICE LINE...,3
Speed is Good but not what on paper. Range is Poor. 2.4 GHz can not even can pass a single floor and speed fall drastically on 2.4 GHz.,3
"Allright.Nice bass
Nice quality 
Nice cusion
But charging is small",3
Camera is not upto the mark,3
Feels like local item does not meet quality expectation from Sony.,3
Not up to the mark. Design is not impressive. Looks good on Amazon product page but while in hands not that much. Need to use for more days then it will be fare enough to review..,3
"It is pretty Good Tracker.
It loses it's 1 star for not having SPO2 monitor.(which must be a key feature for current situation).
And 1 Star for having a little high price(which is not a big deal) But it affects some middle class budgets.",3
ok on the price,3
Printer is fine but it's not possible to get toner.,3
"WiFi signal is too poor, used to have a mi router before this, and it's safe to say that the range of the mi router was at least twice of this. Apart from that, speed on the 5ghz band is lossless and there have been no packet drops, seamless browsing!",3
Sennheiser is far better. JBL gives controlled output. Don't go too loud.,3
"Purchased Putron Tangent Evn in July 20. The product quality is very basic. Sound quality is also basic. Wires are so thin. I don't think they are thick enough to last long.
After use of one month right ear piece stopped working. I have applied throgh putron website (email mentioned thereon) for replacement against one year warranty assurance as given at the time of buying and written on the box.
Let's see apart from the quality of product, how they serve after sale.
I will update my review after getting response from the putron in respect of replacement or repair of my product because my experience in respect of after sale services are not good. Sellers listen only when they are dragged to consumer forum. Let's see how amazon.in helps.",3
"It's a good product but I am not that satisfied with the built quality, they must improve on the product quality, sound quality is not that great but so so satisfactory. Bass is also so so kind of and noise reduction is also the same i feel.",3
"Battery life is ok but it take time to charge
Best Value for money
Slim phone",3
"Pros: very clear and differentiating sound of different instruments. Very good earphone at this price. Outside noise cancellation(in ear). Long and easily untangleable cable. With Mic. Good brand value and aesthetics.

Cons: quite less bass i.e. not as expected. Can't hear at very high volume as it is high pitched and less bass but bass can be improved using sound equalizer based apps.
Durability is less. Didn't expect it to be this less. One side of the earphone is not working and it has only been 11 months of purchase.",3
"Pros:
1. Battery back up is pretty good, i won't use much only when needed
2. If battery is out you can even use Aux pin for listening without battery
3. Aux has a pretty good audio quality. (You won't hear a person who is calling you when you are on Aux and listening music)

Cons:
1. On bluetooth, bad quality of sound (very low sound) as compared to what we hear from Aux.
2. Aux pin is not connected to Mic, when battery is out, you cannot use Headset Mic for calls and all, i have to use phone mic or laptop mic to communicate.

I'm giving my overall rating 3/5.",3
"I find JBL wired earbuds which are around 500-800 INR, much better an this. Audio quality not so good. Even voice quality is also not as per the expectations. It seems as if we are sitting in a hall while talking. Overall external product quality is good. But not recommended for sound.

I do have Infinity headphones too, and as compared to them Infinity is much better.",3
"Had bought in October 2019, left ear stopped working in Feb 2021 the other ear stopped soon after.
The wires are pretty delicate so had to handle it with care. Enjoyed while it lasted.",3
Better to buy inktank,3
As medical devise it is very good but as a smart watch it is far behind same price range watches.. also it have very less watch faces to choose from.,3
"Access Point mode cannot act as an existing Wifi SSID extender likewise other devices.
You would need to connect a LAN cable from the Existing Wifi Router to the LAN port of this device and then only it can extend Wifi network. It became useless for as I was expecting it to extend the Wifi zone without network wire. which I have done with other model of the similar brand.",3
"Does a decent job hiped over wifi6, could buy any wifi for 2k does the same job",3
The printer is good but the printing speed is slow and it gets disconnected frequently from the device. The power chord is loose and have to check it because it gets off frequently.,3
WHEN YOU WILL BUY THIS PHONE THE PHONE WILL BE GREAT BUT LATER IT WILL HAVE HEATING PROBLEM......,3
for that price a good product,3
Didn't mach my expectations...,3
"Light weight good
Durability yet to see",3
range issue .,3
Hurts ur eye,3
Well.. i thought at this price i'll get a nice bass type earphone.. but this earphone is balanced its not bass type.. its bass is very low and it has loud sound which is nice tho.. an 100 rupee earphone can give better bass than this. But still its not that bad. Its light weight and has good in comfort.. the sound output os good and loud. And this earphone is not for bass heads.. bass is low unexpectedly.,3
"Bad foe me i am daily traveling in bus so in bus
Automatically setp counting bad for me",3
"Likes:
1) Lightweight & good material.
2) Good Battery Backup.
3) Sound is good.
Dislikes:
1) Very tight on ear and painfull can not use for long time.
2) Calling is just ok, i have to speak loud to listen to with whom i talk. It might be low quality of mic or some other technical issue.",3
Everage in cheap budget planing.,3
"No mic hook, mic at far-away from mouth - needs holding the mouth piece by hand, not good for people wanting long talks. For music it's decent. Slightly overpriced I felt.",3
Quality is fine and super noise cancellation. only bad thing is loud sounds are very loud and low sounds are very low. so setimes you might not hear all the instruments in a music.,3
I want inform that the adapter is not working and request u to replace at the earliest,3
"Got the product but not able to test it as this was not got connected to my wired broadband connection. Having issue in signin with PPPoE credentials. Same credentials works in my old router. Hence returned.
Below given are some other observations
1) this router dont have wall mounting option.
2) build quality is good
3) android application to manage admin activities. Android app Easy to use.

Thanks amazon for easy return process.",3
"When i bought this product it's working great and sound bass and noise cancellation is all working very well. But not after in purchaseing 2 months now this is not working . It's connected to my Bluetooth but sound don't come for headphone. Now tell me what to dooo
?",3
"Hanging .. problem
And some games are not play in good condition",3
"Average phone as display light is not so bright as compare to Redmi Note - 8 which was initially launched at lower price than redmi 9 power. Also, there are few issues which needs be carefully worked on.",3
fingerprint sensor is not working,3
"good product, but cartridge is very costly , company making money in cartridge",3
"The infinity ""sound quality"" is good but bass is crush, something missing of bass controller and ""bluetooth connectivity"" is good and ""remote control"" is simple and cheaper .",3
"It's okay for your internet routing...
But for games, it does not meet the expectations as such as 300Mbps .... Not quite a thing to purchase",3
"It is absolutely not a BP monitoring app. It has calibrtaedvand giving the same reading every time. Hypertension people gets carried away with this reading.
PLEASE REQUEST FOR REFUND",3
"Day time sleep tracking doesn't work at all... The Alexa update has not been pushed out yet... Weather Push Notifications don't work and most of the time the weather is displayed as blank on the watch face...Always On Display brightness is low even under max brightness... I use with almost all settings like continuous heart rate monitoring and sleep tracking enabled to have a comprehensive assessment of My day, and under such conditions, the battery lasts barely 3 days if you turn on every setting... The Torch option is not available like the other GTS watches... All of this could be fixed with software... Hope they push it out soon...",3
The product is ok. But it has apps which shows ads. And no option to uninstall apps which are not usefull. No option given to uninstall mi browser. They are forcefully selling web browser which no one needs and also forcing people to use their cloud services. Wasting my ram for unwanted apps.,3
"had bought it in lieu of many other router-modems. Build quality is real nice, plenty of vents so heating hasn't been an issue as of yet but summer hasn't set in fully either. Range is somewhat unsatisfactory. I get about 1-3 signals on average, 10 metres away from the router with about 2 walls betwixt.

Decent for streaming digital content to devices although there are better options available. But for the price, it's a decent buy. 6/10",3
"It's just okay, nothing special, except for the brand name. The sound quality is good for this price, no noise cancellation - you can't really expect this at this price point anyways. I have noticed there is a long latency of 3-4 seconds in this headphone, which was surprising because wired headphones are usually praised for zero latency. But however, I have noticed a time lag of about 3-4 seconds.
I would recommend, if you desperately need a headphone - go for this. Or just go for a TWS headphone instead, as the wire gets all tangled up, and at times it becomes frustrating untangling the whole thing.",3
Very good printer... But I have a doubt to quantity of printing pages with full tank ink as promised company...,3
"Sound Quality is good, but the Wires are too delicate. It will worn out within a year of moderate use. Build quality is poor.",3
Audio effects are good. But if I use for sometime then my ear starts paining. Design is also rigid and not flexible to extend. Even after removing the headphone I can feel the pain for sometime,3
"it dos't have numberhow to make number of copies at a time buttons so, there is no visible to no. of copies",3
"The sound quality is very good, as well as bass quality. But it automatically sometimes disconnects from the connected device....Also sometimes when there is an incoming call it doesn't support and the callers voice can't be heard in the headset.",3
"The watch worked perfectly fine for 3 days and now it only shows 1 sports mode. Tried all the troubleshooting steps. Had to get a replacement issued.
Apart from this the watch is perfect.",3
"The camera not have 48 mp quality it gives texture type image
Also selfi camera giving worste image.",3
"Step counter is accurate it's count your hand movements also, so if you're not walk and just moving your Mi ban will count as a step. Apart from that everything is good.",3
"Good watch, doesn't show week number though. I had pebble watch before this but somehow mi band isn't able to replace that. The display sensitivity is low despite tweaking the settings.",3
Sound quality Low,3
The only problem is it is too heavy...so if you wear it for a longer time then it will cause headache..other wise good,3
"Redmi 9 Power Electric Green (4+128)
(FIRST 24-HOURS REVIEW)
• A phone with Superb Design and unique colours
• I have purchased electric green colour and believe it is really superB in looks
• Heavy in weight but its okey as it looks fine in hands
• Dual stereo speakers with ultimate sound quality
!! BUT BUT BUT !!
• Redmi claimed 6000mAh Battery, means we think that it will go through atlest ""1 & Half day to 2 days"" of battery backup in one charge, But there is nothing like that.
• The Battery will Last go to 1 day of maximum backup only if limited use.
(I charged the phone full in last evening by 7pm and its 1 pm today righ now and it is 55% left with no use as i am using it as a secondary phone, means the Remaining 55% battery will last longer to 11pm. The total battery backup without use of phone will go to 28 Hours, as i am using it as a secondary phone with no whatsapp, youtube or any kind of internet surfing with this phone)
• It means if u want to use it as a primary phone with whatsapp, youtube, and other internet features then i dont think so that it can give 1 day backup
• Redmi claimed 22W Fast Charger with it, apart from it while using its own 22W fast charger it takes more then enough time to charge
(It takes time to Charge full)
• Camera quality is like hell, specially the front camera, Don't buy if u wants a Camera Quality in Mid Range phone
Summary:-
Purchase it if u want as a secondary phone
Purchase it if u want super outer looks with ultimate colour options
Purchase it if u dont want good selfie camera quality (According to price range)
Purchase it if u want a Good Looking Attractive Phone",3
"I got my device yesterday....looks like ""its ok""
After some detailed checking i found a mark on the display.....seems like a small pond...not so noticing.....what i have to do?i am disappointed!
The sellers should strictly rectify their product before packing",3
It keeps disconnecting again and again .. may be some loose connection issue,3
"It's ok to use.
Battery is fine.
Made in China.",3
Average performance but also law price,3
"Within 50 days it's stop working..
Difficulty in charging... At present it's becomes a dabba only.... Due to lock down it can't be repaired or replaced..
Very bad experience with redmi",3
Not worth to buy,3
"Cheap and okay product. Size of ear pieces is small, suitable only for kids/teenagers. Sound is ok.",3
Wasn't compatible with my redmi mobile.,3
Okay product. Sound quality is not great so I would've preferred some other product. But it's okay @₹500.,3
This band ok but friends u want to buy means wait for mi band 5,3
"Lightweight. Good for browsing, general editing stuff. Decent boot time. However if u run a video call using teams or simply lar, the cpu is hogged completely, and you cannot multi task. It is a good option for general browsing, streaming videos, basic editing being done in parallel.",3
"Good product.
Noise cancelling not as effective.
You know once you use.",3
Actually I didn’t get the desired speed.Dont know whether it is problem with router or problem with service provider,3
Good but Google fit sync not possible and no option to reject call,3
Size is too small,3
There is no bass and treble controller and bass is not up to the mark but in 2200 rupees the best thing i ever buy,3
"Not that much better only for base lovers
Mi basic earphones better than this and the packaging of boat earphones are worst.",3
"1. Signal Strength : 9/10
""The signal strength is good, slightly higher than other routers. My broadband speed is 50 Mbps and over wireless I can get almost 40 to 45 Mbps.""

2. Other Features : 10/10
""Most special thing about this is that it has an app from which you can manage each and every basic settings of your router. Guest Network is also available.""

3. Easy to use : 10/10
""In market TP-Link routers are the easiest routers to use & setup. Connect all wires and go to <tplinkwifi.net> then you'll get the setup page by entering the admin username & password, after that modifying the settings is very easy.""

4. Durability : 6/10
""The white part or you'll call the main body is made of plastic which has small vents for air flow & it router doesn't heat up too much. The long black antennas are slight delicate but it does a great job.",3
Average.,3
"it work nice but material used is of bad quality, light weight",3
"Made In China Mobile
No Made in india sticker on Mobile box
This is disappointing to me
the camera quality is not good like 48 mega pixel no zoom in 48mp camera and front camera also not good like 13 Mega Pixel.
But otherwise every thing is good.
Amazon delivery and exchange policy was nice and delivery boy behavior was good
Amazon gives good exchange value on old product better than flipkart",3
"I am giving it a 3 star because the build is soo bad my headphone got broken after 1 year approx
And sound quality is best in the segment. Bass is perfect and instrumental differentiation is amazing.
And comfort of this headphone is also amazing at this price
The only problem is build. So keep in mind that. Importantly the wire inside was not broken the frame was broken.",3
Sound is completly average justifying the price of it but Apart from that the labelling for right & left headphones is barely visible which is a problem for elders to see .,3
"Ok type phone but in same cost you may get good deal in samsung now.
No fingerprint reader,camera is ok ok",3
Good product.Product is good. Does its job. My unit had a leg rubber missing.,3
i can't my wifi router since last one week it is does't connect network so what is your service about on this,3
Phone is lagging after 4 days of usuage and lags while opening basic apps like camera... Really disappointed..,3
Camera quality is not much expected. Battery backup and screen size is good,3
"Each day is automatically disconnected, and same time seen blank screen,And find your phone tracking is not working,",3
Not bad. No 5.1 this is for 2.1 is good,3
After I received it used it for 2-3days and mike stopped working. Got replacement but again mike stopped working so sent is for repair /replacement again. Otherwise sound is good.,3
There are a few dead pixels here and there. The service center is acknowledging their existence but say they are too small and I should just ignore them.,3
GPS tracking in mobile is incorrect,3
"Sound quality is good but but not for long term after 3-4 months earphones start having lots of problems like one side not working and after Jack not working so not durable for long term and also after sell service is also poor, take least one month for service process.",3
"good signal strength, if there is no wall in between. performance of signal is a bit weak through walls",3
This looks very nice but it has issues with iphone sync. Also observed inaccurate step count. I was just sitting in same place and the step count increased to 75 :) not sure what type of algorithm it uses. And walked for almost 45 mins and step count on watch was 5k+ steps but even after 2 hours the steps did not get sync with phone(though it shows last sync time correctly). May be I received a defective product. Returning it today,3
Audio quality is good. But ear cushions are very bad. One cannot wear it more than 30 minutes. Bluetooth connectivity is not good sometime sound is not audible. Build quality is not good. For me it broke in 2 months.,3
"Pros:
Clear sound
Sound is high
Wire looks durable
Mic works well
Cons:
Jack is not L-shaped
Jack is not gold plated
Sound is fine but the bass is not that deep. The bass transition is not that good.",3
good purchase & helpful for small bussiness people,3
It has connectivity problems and the gps stops tracking after slme time.,3
"When I received it, I felt like the screen looked smaller than a 24 inch. And so I measured it and turns out, it is a 21 inch screen.",3
"I AM FIRST TIME USER OF REDMI PHONE.
AT THIS COST THIS PHONE IS BEST.P-HONE IS WORKING SMOOTHLY.
ALL GAME ARE RUN SMOOTHLY. NFS RUN OKAY.
BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD.
CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT GOOD. BELOW AVERAGE.
FINGERPRINT READER IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS PHONE.",3
My old router was a Belkin 850 and that had a slightly better range than this one. Looks great though. Overall decent product.,3
Battery is good but disappointed with camera quality. I will not recommend this product is anyone,3
"Message and App notification not working properly .
other view its good product.",3
Battery is not full charged.Backup very loose one and half time charge my 3000 mah battery,3
"Please see and buy as it doesn't support many broadband services , it won't work with ion , metronet , etc...",3
"Not happy with it . Complicated operational features .
HP pronters much better with lesser ink consumption",3
This is ok ok phone and not the redmi best hence u can have in this Price segment good phones avoid buying this product if u can.......,3
Everything is good only wire is not in good quality. And voice up and down not available.... Otherwise good,3
"Sound Quality is moderate. Built wise its pretty sleek. My review is based on 4 -5 months of use.
The comfort factor is pretty low. Feels a bit tight after few minutes, tried various setting on the headband.

Only thing I can say.... don't expect too much from these model. If you are looking for budget headset then go for it.",3
Yesterday I bought this phone but today I noticed my phone battery going very fastly down,3
Product is good but it take long time to start,3
"Camera quality - worse than redmi 8a dual and also in this category, battery - nice , performance - as expected from this budget smartphone , build - Okay and non slippery so that's a plus",3
"Mic 🎤 does not work properly, it is very less sensitive and does not work effectively on bluetooth mode...and during wired mode your device mic will have to do the work...so it's just a headphone without mic for me.",3
Sumar,3
It takes three to four hours to charge the battery. The fast charger became a bit slow charger,3
Sound quality not so good,3
Mobile quality not good and network issues,3
Average build quality,3
less bass due to less compression on the earbud.but with the price i.e549 i like it,3
Sleep monitor function is not logical. It is counted only night. All other functions are okiesh. Dial is bigger one. just ok,3
"Pros:
Compact and light
Hangable on wall

Cons:
Atleast I didn't recieve the signal in ground floor after placing this on 1st floor in 1200 sqft site. So signal strenth is weak.

P.S. Amazon need to update the image to match new version C6 Archer",3
"I got it for my friend. According to her, the sound quality is okay. Although one side of the earpieces keeps falling from ear. The color is unusual, some might like, some might not. All in all, in this price it's a good to go earphones.",3
The material is good. Appearance is nice. But the sound quality is not upto the mark at all,3
"Product recieved in good shape but with older FIRMWARE, contacted DLINK support for FIRMWARE Updation and now working ok.
please supply Updated products to avoid cancellations as it happened in my case with earlier purchased MODEM of similar type.",3
"It's a OK product.
Servers the purpose.
Don't expect too much.
The most lack of thing is there is no volume control button available.",3
Earphone is of good quality. But one issue is that wire at end that's at jack is straight. Straight wire gets damaged easily. It should be L Shaped at end.,3
"Sound quality ain't that good . Even at 500 , it doesn't comes out as a bargain",3
"Putting display part on charging dock is a real headache.. it doesn't fit on charging dock.. every time i try to put, it just pop up..",3
"Watch is amazing but its battery backup is so disappointing. 1st day when i received the watch it was charged to 47 % and it drained in just 14 hours. Now on 2nd day, have charged to full and in just 12 hours 15% battery has been drained out already. So as per this it would not going beyond 3-4 days on full charge.",3
"Does not catches the connectivity range in my hall, when router is place in one of my bedroom. need a ""range extender"", I feel, can you suggest which can be suitable for my TP-LINK TL-WR841N 300Mbps WIRELESS N, Recently brought through amazon via invoice Number: MH-BOM4-1004-527918.",3
"Sound quality is ok but ok means in 999 INR No one can get the better option ..

After playing music around 10-15 minutes getting some noice break issue in headphone & seems like product sustainability is not accurate ..

Boat Rockerz 450 body is to light due to that is comes under handle with care concerns if it's not handled carefully then it will only usable forax 1-2 weeks for usage purpose..

Again in 999 INR I got but if Amazon sell the same in 1299 INR then I think thrice atleast ..

& Amazon sale is ok ok not find some boom- boom sale this year.",3
"Notification LED light is not available in this mobile, home screen will change after restart, the। sound of earphones is not loud with mi earphones, battery is running out quickly in few days. I feel rubbish
compared to my previous mobile mi A1.",3
Can I Exchange this Printer with other more Prices Printer.,3
better go for inktank printer,3
Durability of product. I am using it from last 2 years and now started facing the problem as one of its speaker input socket is not working. I think its too early to have such problems from such a renowned brand. Sound quality is ok not superb. But in 5k we expect nore than this.,3
Quality is not good,3
"It's a good product,",3
Volume is very low and cabling is of inferior quality with short wires.,3
"Not worthy fr price paid, spo2 is missing which is avaliable in basic smart watches",3
"Accuracy is not good, it count steps on motorbike,,,design is not just ok, I like honor band 5 design instead of mi",3
"Mobile app must need update, touch is ok and accuracy also needs improvement. Screen timeout should have adjustible settings.",3
"I like the heart tracking and calories burn feature.
Sleep tracker is not up to the mark.
you can not operate music when you use exercise feature",3
This phone heats more than iron press. Whenever I play pes21 on this phone it gains so much of heat that game starts lagging. Worst phone.Don't buy it.,3
Please share invoice on priority as we need befor 28th Dec.Thanks,3
No any tech support,3
Don't buy it broke only in two months:And voice is not come from one side earcup:,3
I got the watch. It’s a great product. The special functions of the watch are amazing. I am very much satisfied with the product.,3
Cartridge quickly empty,3
Its a good product from Dlink however I am not satisfied with the range of this modem despite the two antennae. Less than 20metre and signal reduces to just 2 bars!! Not happy... Another modem from Beetle does way better job in my home than this shit.,3
I don't know why i am not able to reject calls and get notifications??,3
"Packaging was poor even they packed it in a simple cartan box not of Sony but product is quite good
Good base and sound",3
"I have been using it for a month...
This product is too good and if we disconnect the internet connection then it continuosly record in SDcard and the picture quality is also good but the output speaker not so good ,there is an to much echo in output audio but it was an temporary,it was fixed by a update.
overall it was value for money at ₹2,199 thank for read this comment",3
"Sleep tracking is not done properly. Accuracy is not always correct.
Worst synchronisation
Doesn't even save your activity of previous day.",3
This is a budgeted device very useful and good quality of the cartridge. Everything was OK till date.,3
"I got a damaged AUX cable, one end is missing i.e. damaged.",3
Its a sports watch and not a regular wear smart watch. Phone call features and similar features not available,3
"I have been using this printer since 2019 and I just took prints and thought why not write the truth about it.
I have printed over 2000 pages till now and I have been using the same Cartridge that came with the printer when I bought it.
I just refill the Cartridge instead buying a new one. The New Cartridge by hp can only print 50-60 pages. You can refill and prints as many pages you want.
Buy this printer and buy the ink bottles you get. 2ml of the refilled ink gives me at least 60-70 prints.
The ink bottle will cost you around Rs. 150-200 and it will have 100ml. That's roughly 5000+ prints give and take.
So total investment = 1500(Printer) + Ink(200) = 1700/-
That's roughly 2 rupees per print! By the time you get around 2000 prints, your printer cost is covered and the next prints will be free of cost.",3
I am disappointed because this is my first order from amazon & the left speaker is dead.Sound quality is okay.The replacement TAT is again 4 days which sounds miserable.I think flipcart is a better option since I haven't received any faulty products as of now.,3
"Like the sound quality especially bass , black colour with matte finish was looking good but the only thing I dislike is the build quality , literally the quality of plastic is so bad it's easily breakable aven without much force .",3
Print quality is excellent but the refill cost is very high...not useful for those who have lots of print regularly,3
"Build quality is good.
Good design since it is foldable/flippable.
Sould quality is good (wide fidelity 20-15khz)
Cons: crushes/squuze your ears if you are wearing it over ears for a long time.",3
"Battery drains a lot. 5000 mah .is useless. even with average usage, it lasts only a day. Even in stand by battery drains.Its only the price and decent performance that I have given it 3 star else would have chosen only 1 star.",3
Accuracy is not good.,3
per page print cost is high. print quality is good. it is easy to install and use.,3
The range of the coverage is really good. Its around 30meter in diameter. It can come across 3 walls of hinderance. But often it looses connection and have to restart it.,3
Ears get very pain after one hour use the ear pads are not very comfortable,3
Sound quality - average & noise cancellation - below average and bass quality - below average,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Picture quality is Good not that great. There is too much Ghosting in monitor. Dell website states that this model has three Responce time; 8 ms (grey-to-grey normal); 5 ms (grey-to-grey fast); 4 ms (grey-to-grey extreme) For casual use like typing or watching video its ok. But 5ms and 4ms is non usable. You can't game or do 3d modeling in 8ms. Responce time of 5ms or 4ms gives Ghosting effect which is unbearable for me. I have attached Video for example.

P.s I have asus mx239h which is 5 year old monitor and it has superior picture quality and no ghosting(4ms responce). And I bought it for 14500rs.. 5 years ago.",3
"Looks and comfort is nice, but the audio is getting interrupted frequently while connecting to bluetooth.",3
"There is a software problem, whenever you make a call for the 1st time the speaker is not activated and so you can't hear anything the person on the other side is speaking. But if you disconnect it and call again it works fine. Initially i thought its network issue but later i realised it happens every time i try to make i call after a considerable time gap like an hour or so.",3
Sound is not loud enough compared to other products in the same range.,3
"If you've experienced seinnheiser/jbl or the like, you'll find this extremely mediocre and sometimes uncomfortable on the ears. Otherwise, the wire seems quite durable.",3
"I am facing the screen flickering while using ICICI Mobile banking. is there anyone who is facing the same problem.and any guideline to solve this .
so many unuseful apps are available.unable to disable like stock Android...better to go with stock android phone",3
"These do not come with silicon covers on the buds, keeps slipping off !!",3
"Product overall quality is ok type, not something which i can say mind-boggling.
Plastic is had type but a cusion below head portion.
Noice cancellation is not so good we can hear ambient noice, but after playing song rearly you can heat any thing
Aux cambe is provided and can be used as normal wired headset.
Bass is ok but treble is flat.
Just used 3 day its giving 5 hours average battery.",3

"I ordered this phone day after today and it has been delivered to me. I did not like this phone at all because this phone heats up quickly and the sound of the phone speaker is also very low. Therefore, I would suggest that you spend more than 2000 rupees. And buy other smartphones of Realme.
But in this MRP it is good",3
Fear,3
Bought it about a month ago. The sound quality as expected from Sony. Although I found the cord length bit short but sturdy. Good product overall with in time delivery.,3

It will make you sick mentaly.

And when we sit in auto or vichle it started counting step. I think its not woth it.

Best part is you get a trainer.. thats it..and for that ihave given rating.",3

"Build quality of phone is not good,and functioning is not smooth",3
Quite good for middle range mobile phones performance vice low other mobile overall average smart phone,3
Headphone quality is good for the pricing but don't expect a boom box sound out of it. Even in the home environment the volume is on the quieter side. So spend a bit extra and buy a better headphone for your hearing delighted.,3
Printer driver could not be downloaded and install despite several attempts,3
Call audio clarity is really poor.,3
"Finger print reader not available.
Batter drains very fast. 100% charged worked for 10 hrs..",3

"for the price 4300 it is not satisfactory
there many things availble in 3000 rupees",3
"It's been 3 months since I have been using these and I want to say that sound quality, noise cancellation and bass is good. But problem comes with the fitting of earbuds in the ear, it doesn't feel comfortable especially when you u r eating something and they come out sometimes. The quality of wire is not good as it get tangled very easily and sometimes it's very annoying to untangle it, it feels like solving a puzzle😒",3
This product fits well. It does some level of noise cancellation. But sound quality is not up to the mark or even does not do any justice to the name of this headset. The name Blast sounds really funny once you start using this headset.,3
This is Single band or dual band???,3
"I am facing issue with my new mi band4, it is showing blue line at the bottom in sunlight, indoor its working fine, anyone facing same issue?
Asked for replacement.",3
We replaced our single tower router with this 3 tower router so that we get full signal across the house but the signal strength is similar to previous one. Not satisfied.,3
"Liked -
1. EPSON Packaging. Made it survive the Amazon manhandling. Damage sustained to printer would have greater because of the bad handling by AMAZON.
2. EPSON Service. On time & efficient. Complete diagnostic check by rep. Patiently answered all queries repaired, help set up the complete printer and explained all very nicely.
3. TIP - Ask the Customer Care to give you the service centre's details and call them up. Register your product on EPSON Site. MOST IMPORTANT.
4. Ink dispensing bottles. Spill proof, unless you really wish o go to battle with them, easy to use. Precise quantity.
5. Design/looks without opening the paper guidance and the paper tray is very neat. Build quality is fragile.
6. Print Quality is good. Print speed is faster than other ink jet/ tank printers.

Did Not like -
1. AMAZON did a very poor job of packaging it. It was just covered with cling film, not even bubble wrap to avoid vagaries of transportation. Which probably resulted in the defect.
2. Long time to install, makes all sorts of noises. It definitely takes more than the 10 minutes......
Extremely Noisy printer. Everyone will know you printing !!!!
3. Installation of drivers only through CD. Was unable to upload from Net. It did update almost all drivers from Net once installed.
4. The build quality is extremely fragile. if you happen to drop something on it.....God Help you. But on the other hand it survived the Amazon manhandling. Will reword...It feels fragile.
5. The gear in the scan/photocopy section was misaligned. Had to call EPSON Service Centre to resolve. Scanner section had to be opened and the gear realigned.

SUMMARY - Buy it from your local dealer, better option. AMAZON is getting cheaper by the day. ZERO security packaging from Amazon. And get an EPSON service representative to set it up for you.
Its not meant to be transported once opened, too fragile for that.",3
Best in range segment. Screen resolution could be better. 720P for 23k is not worthy .,3
"1.Camrea is not good
2. Phone weight to much",3
"It’s good for a beginner I must say not for the someone who’s looking for more features in a economical price. I wanted a Camera for a purpose of shooting YouTube and small Events. We’ll never mind we all can always have the best with the option of just a click.
Five keys to take away from this experience.
• Best for beginners
• Not very economical for the price
• Amazon has the options needed
• Canon’s playing with it’s good will
• Well, never mind nobody’s going to take it seriously",3
Compact... Easy to use and cleaning.,3
It's Okay!,3
Bluetooth doesn't work properly with sony laptop.,3
As per tech specs Wi-Fi Speed: AC1200 (866 + 300 Mbps) . I have ACT broadband connection with Act storm plan and it offers 300 Mbps speed. But this router never goes more then 200 Mbps on 5 GHz band. Before buying this product please verify your speed requirement. Thank you.,3
camera and speed not good,3
It's ink over too quickly.,3
For this amount it's a good price. Got it for 11999/- worth it. Phone is a bit bulky if you go to see. Kind in heavy. Colour is really good. Purchased it for my mother in law and they are happy with it. Good budget phone.,3

Like phone and battery good camra not good,3
The look is deceptive. It is of a very limited range. The data transfer range is also very limited. I am enquiring for an exchange-upgradation possibility from TP Link.,3
The power cable wont fit,3
Good mobile. Better camera.better battery,3
"Material is too good, easy to handle.",3
The printer has stopped working...even though the black cartridge is not finished but the printed has stopped working...I got this printer on 29th june....its been only few days its performance is not good...,3

Within the floor the signal receiveis okay but its very weak in the immediate next floor.,3
Good one... But seriously not for music lovers. It's average product,3
Wire is very thin and it gives feeling that it will break soon. Hope it will not. Sound quality is average. Noise cancellation is almost none.,3
OK phone.. 48mp camera picture transfer in other phone looks blurred. 😑..ok phone. Only good point if u loose it u will not feel sad as its just 13k. 🤓,3

I would have given 5/5 if I didn't faced login issue repeatedly",3
"Pros:
1. Sound quality is better that my laptop

The first time I ordered I liked it very much but the wire near socket was broken within six months so the earphones were not working.i thought it was my mistake due to my poor management .I ordered again and same thing happened again. It's been only 5 months that's it.
Please improve the wire quality ..that is make it stronger so that it won't bend or break easily especially near the socket",3
It's not working in lg led tv,3
Looks fragile. Otherwise decent product. Left and right cushions not very comfortable.,3
"Worst headphones ever voice not clear, bluetooth connectivity issue, charging not proper overall 30% likes out of 100%. Don't purchase this product go for another one and my opinion is to go for BOAT ROCKERZ 380.
THANK U",3
It's wire is pretty long which is a plus for me. It's mic is also good it gives clear voice. The only thing I don't like about it is its volume. Is there a bass? I don't think so. If Compared to other headphones like beats then I can say it has almost no bass. You can hear clearly but its volume is too low even at max volume set in my pc and on the headphones.,3
JBL may sound as some fancy brand who graciously provided u with these decently priced earphones. But here's the catch being made entirely out of plastics making the light but that does affect the drivers capability to crank out the amount of sound u expect u still feel the deficiency of the lower range sounds. Noise cancelling Isn't great though but when u turn the volume to max isolation is felt. Somewhere the thin cables makes me insecure regarding the use gives of sense of them breaking too soon. If u are in the he market for some just for casual use headphones these are the ones.,3
"Dial is very small, display is bright, strap quality is ok, Battery life is average, step count is not accurate when your driving car i observed step count increase upto 200. SPO2 takes lot of time to measure, accuracy is +- 3%

Over all its an average smart watch with good display",3
Average sounds not as per expectation.....,3
"Expected a lot from it but disappointed as it restarts once in every 2 hrs. Returned It.

Pros:
1. Easy installation

3. Internet Speed is good in 2.4 ghz

Cons:
1. Restarts every couple of hrs.
2. Wifi Signal strength is less, my other 900 rs TPlink router gives the same signal strength.
3. Rebooting takes lot of time, my 900 rs router reboots with in seconds.
4. Bigger in size.",3
I got replacement very quickly as 1st one stopped working suddenly. May be my phone MI 4 has some issue don't know. But it good for everyone,3
The earplug was good until it worked but then suddenly one side stopped working. It has happened with me at least three times now with the Boat earplugs while the other earplugs of the same price working perfectly since last six months or so. Can't return as it happened after around 15 days. Sound quality was great though.,3
Value for money good product,3
The ink given is finished very soon with a print of 50 copeis.,3
I received my package on 7 January 2019 after ordering on 6 January 2019. I like the speaker and sound and everything is good. But when I looked at the remote it was broken. The photo is proof. I bought the item from Appario Retail Private Ltd. I don't have the time or energy for replacement so I have to live with it. Please be careful while buying this product.,3

First I bought this when it came to me it was defective peice and then again I. Wasted my time by replacement and again it working fine so please don't buy this buy any other company router not this one I wasted my money you don't,3
Dial is bigger else it is ok,3
Only louder volume.dont expect clarity and good music quality.good at this price of 2k.,3
Bluetooth Connectivity dropping & Notification issues. Be careful not issue refund only exchange which is not acceptable for amazon kind of compamy.,3
"Actually my ear starts paining after 1 hr. When I brought it, I can't wear it for more than 10 minutes. Also when we do voice call, the sound quality is not nice. Enough of background noise goes to the listener. They must work on this.

"I like this band. But it has the major problem,
That is, it measure the heart rate sensor when the band is not in the hand",3
"The product is good and bluetooth functions well but the sound is very less and there is no bass and treble control,so you cant increase the bass and treble...Though I have got it yesterday, so its too quick for me to give a complete review.But the sound is not up to the mark as I thought and is very low compared to the same ranges intex or other music system",3
Everything is acceptable but first one is one dummy camera is making foolish to customer & 2nd thing is camera quality is so poor so camera lover pls if you looking this phone for selfi related than strictly prohibited for purchase this one,3
"Sound is good enough according to price level. But bass is very low , when volume is high we cannot hear any bass at all. Other than that it is a good product.",3

Hi the product is under warranty and I need a replacement. Could you please direct me to the right resource?,3
Performance not up to the mark.This battery backup is only 1.5 - 2 hrs only.,3
Bluetooth connectivity is very bad when you increase sound it automatically gets disconnected,3
"Purchased this 2.1 using my wife's Amazon Prime account. Received decent discounts and fast delivery.
The build quality of the speakers is good and looks premium.
On the connectivity front, it has Aux and Bluetooth which work flawlessly.
The Bluetooth connection is fast and works seamlessly. Aux is of decent quality but the chord is not too long. Average in this segment.
Now for the sound. Please note that there is no way to adjust to the Bass / Treble on this thing. You get EQ options - Game / Music / Movies of which Music is default selected when you switch it on. This mode has the best sound of the 3 modes.
There is also an Eco mode which will automatically switch off the system if it is not in use. I have kept it off since it doesn't matter to me and it is always in use.
Now the sound quality on this system is nowhere comparable to the competitors such as F&D. I own an F&D 550x and that sounds much more powerful compared to this. I also own a Samsung HWK20 2.1 speaker which sounds the best of all 3 with crisp treble, great vocals, and deep bass.
The remote that comes with this infinity system is tiny and easy to lose, but it works well.
Overall I would not recommend this system to anyone who wants great bass and treble with their audio. This is good enough for connecting with TV for regular TV Soaps, Movies, and Music if you are not satisfied with TV audio and need something on a budget. I would still recommend going in for F&D or Samsung which gives much better bang for the money.",3
"Noise cancellation is good .But bass quality is poor. Mic is good.Overall sound quality is average.
But couldn't enjoy listening to music much. with this.
One could easily get better earphones , if spent some more.

Compared to Jbl found Boat better for similar price ranges.",3
"Headphones quality is good 👍. But if I talk about the accessories, USB and AUX cable quality is bad, it was cracked in a couple of days only so I had to purchase a new aux cable and usb charger from the Market. And I'm bit disappointed with the noise cancellation,coz it doesn't work at all. so it's worth buying for the personal use only not for office.",3
camer is decent,3
Fine product,3
Print quality of color photos is not good as I expect,3
"Brought this product on 22 June 2017. And on 27th August 2018 it stopped working.. red power light blinking..
Now I tried to reach the tech support, no hope so called Amazon, the guy helped me with a number.. may be not knowing it's not working. There is a WhatsApp number on the product description, that says it's switched off..

Works with jio fiber. Lasts only for 2 n half hour. I have wifi plus a wired lan cable,3
I have been using this camera for 7 days with 128 GB SD Card inserted. Motion detection is slow responsive and cannot schedule only Motion Detection Recording between midnight 12:30 AM to 5 AM. Still cannot tell about the rotative motor used in this camera.,3
Phone is good but the brightness of the phone is little low and their was no phone cover and tempered glass with the phone.,3
It don't have fingerprint,3
It does its job well but has network range issues beyond 20m especially if its in another room,3
"With it's nice design, sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality is also excellent.",3
I liked this printer but printing cost was high.,3
Ok value for money,3
The product is okay. It just works. Don't buy it for the three antennas. I don't think it has effect on that. I beleive it's just a marketing gimmick. Also it doesn't have power button. I don't understand why. So everytime I have to restart the router I have to pull out the power cable.,3

"Display quality is very bad, camera is not so good, i did not get headset.",3
"Compared to band 3 there wasn't any major update except multiple screen display and multi modes in physical activity. The dsiplay was a little bit big compared to band 3. The shape of the band 3 was curved which has a great look, but band 4 was provided with rectangular shape which wasn't great. So overall it's not a successor for mi band 3.",3

Good. Nice looking.,3
"Good graphics performance but still You'll not feel it's 9th Gen I5 processer.
You'll feel lags in each task like opening windows explorer or editing videos.
Video rendering speed is very good but while editing it hangs so many times.
I have another Asus i5 processer without graphics but that's working like MAKHAN
Keyboard is also little different so it takes time to get used to it.
And yes you'll see it's heating more than normal when you're rendering videos or playing games",3
"These earphones are pretty good for their price. The servicing is a whole other story, unfortunately.
One of my earphones stopped working after about 6 months of usage, I called the service centre to claim my warranty. However, they said that they DONOT service this device and will only service bassheads 200/225/250. Really disappointed. The warranty on these earphones are absolutely useless.

Priorly before replacement they gave me tamper camera which was not seal packed didn't had the guide book camera was not covered with plastic.It was just a damaged piece which was delivered .,3
WiFi range is 18meters with 3 walls of 5 inch each on same floor. I needed 25 meters to cover my entire home corners but it is failed to do so. It's a good choice for small homes and offices only.,3
Volume not as loud as expected. FM Radio does not pick up the signal. No reception. Sound not separately discernable on different channels. It is as if all channels play all the sounds.,3
"Delivery was superfast as i opted one day delivery. Product is working nice but i am facing disconnection issue.

No idea its from ISP side or the hardware is at fault.

Should i go for replacement.",3
Used for 7-8 months later rubber coating on cushion started peeling off..but other wise worth buying..!!!,3

It disappears on WiFi sometimes and am not able to find it on my apple devices, it takes sometime to appear on WiFi. No AirPrint. Cloud print and WiFi direct works fine. I will say it is an average printer at this cost.",3
Almost ok product,3
"The print quality is not upto the mark. Expected a better response of cartridges, sadly not.",3
WiFi coverage is average. My old Belkin 150N router used to give better coverage under similar circumstances and position. I am not able to get more than 45mbps with 5ms ping.On my old router I used to get 50mbps with 2ms ping.,3
"This Device is Just Ok for You !
Cons - Step Tracking is not accurate because if you are driving bike or travelling like in bus , and because of that your rist is moving a little it starts considering that as steps and increase step count .

So step count is not accurate .
Buy it for not missing your calls and just to see time and who is calling . But as tracker it's not accurate.",3
"Cool stylish look.
Sound clarity decent. Volume output ( perceived) is lower than other reputed headphones.

Being a long time fan if Sony products,, Expected a better product from Sony",3
Not that much good size of the watch is too small,3
It looks ugly and the fit is way too weird and uncomfortable. But the sound quality is fine ig.,3
"Why 3 starts?

Build quality is the issue here. The extender part's plastic breaks very easily. This is the part where the wires are concealed. They break on wearing it for just 10 days. I am not sure about the long run.

Battery life is just amazing. I use it heavily throughout the day and I have to charge only once a week with noise cancellation ON all the time.

Noise cancellation is not that effective. It reduces noise(fan) not the environmental sound completely. You can still hear TV dialogues and human voices very well. I don't find the ambient mode to be that effective.

This is quite large compared to the headphones under 5K. I found it difficult to wear for the first week, then I got accustomed to it and now feels comfortable.

I would suggest this headphone ,but you should consider the build quality.

Pros:
Battery life
Sound quality
Ease of use

Adapter has broken 2 times. Thanks to Tp link service center they changed it with used adapter. Next time don't know when the charging adapter will break.,3
It can be used for extended wifi connection however not useful for single router.,3
"Average phone considering price range.

1. Camera quality: average, no slow motion or time lapse feature available, no zoom when using 48mp. Front camera, below average. Sometimes I take a photo that doesn't get stored, quite annoying.
2. Weight: quite heavy, you feel the difference when you take some other phone in your hand.
3. screen type: lcd not led or amoled
4. Batter life: looks good with normal usage.
5. Phone body: back panel looks like of plastic, it would have been better if matelic had been used.
6: user interface: sometimes very hard to do something, like taking a screenshot. Could have been given some better option to do that. Also, I use night model, where it gets better into grayscale in night, I can't customize some options like what apps and what type of do not disturb I want, also if had turn it off in some urgent cases I have to go back into settings and then disable it. Not an easy option provided.
Face recognition: not fast and accurate.",3
"Looking vry odd, head band is vry big size, & Bluetooth connection automatically disconnect after few minute of playing song.",3
"Speaker quality is good
Base is good
Earphone is decent for listening to music.

Cons:
Microphone is not good enough to talk handsfree. The mic needs to be pulled near mouth for proper communication.

Cables above the microphone are thin, looks very fragile.

3.5 mm jack is lose on 2 of my phones.",3
Cheap quality plastic but at this price satisfied with brand.,3
Except RAM it is ok..speed is very very slow,3
Thyrocare sugar test strips.The product was perfect as described by the seller,3
"Bass is good, an ordinary headphone. Don't expect too much out of it. Overall sound quality is ok.",3
"I ran ~3 kms and the watch shows 27 steps. This is completely wrong.
The distance accuracy seems reasonable.
Battery - seems reasonable. At current rate it should last 8-10 days.",3

It's amazing phone in lowest price,3
"Pros:
Sound quality is really good.
Material quality is good.

Cons:
Poor or bad design, you can tilt and twist the speakers because of its design.
So, one of the speaker got detached from the headset.
Now, we cannot use it though it works properly.
Not so durable, because of bad design.",3
"I find easy to install and working well for bsnl broadband.
Ramadoss",3
Glucose Meter.Some time difference between lab test result.,3
"Bought the Made in India one and its good. The length, the sound quality, the look is decent. Also got a pouch and a strap with it.

I had purchased boat earphone 2 years ago and it is still work finely just the mic has become less sensitive.

Go for the Made in India one instead of the chinese one.

Writing after using few days, you cannot keep listening for long ears literally start hurting like a rash. I wish i had bought the previous ones again.",3
"My last piece of JBL stopped working out of nowhere. It worked for 7 months only. If this one does the same, I am never buying anything from amazon again. Also the sound, it’s nothing like the original JBL.",3

"When compared to honor band 5, mi band 4 its accuracy isn't correct and also a some difference in sleep tracking and watchfaces isn't good and the watch should update in watch setting option like different without a mobile app....this is fitness band it's should say accuracy right..... But it's not have an accuracy....if it will update it will be good for this price...",3
Good product. As per the showing on amezon web site,3

Screen got freezed sometime

Else the Phone is nice, worth it on budget.",3
Installed this router at home. I have 50 mbps connection. But this wifi only gives a max of 21mbps. Product says 300 mbps but its not correct....,3
"Good headphone at 499. You can't find the brand value of Sony at this price point. If you like to listen music the way it is then this is for you but if you're a Bass lover then you might feel disappointed. Seems a little tight at start but as you use it the fitting becomes normal.
Pros : Value for money, Kinda feels like its fragile but its not, Passive noise cancellation, Good stereo sound.
Cons : No Mic so can't use it for calls, No Bass, Ear pads could have been better.",3
"Doesn't meet the reason of my purchase. I am not happy with the products due to very limited support for 3rs party apps notification alerts and no Outlook notifications for which I purchased this product.

Below are my initial impressions of1st day usage

Pros
- Decent build quality
- Nice display
- Responsive screen

Cons
- No support for 3rd party app notification alerts like Microsoft Teams & Outlook
- Very less watch faces even on the Noise fit cloud app
- Very less customization option of watch faces
- Lag of 2-3seconds on wrist wake which makes it look like immatured product in this price range.

@Noise support/dev team - Can someone reach out to me if there's a way to add prominent 3rd party apps like(Outlook and Microsoft Teams) in the notification alert list",3
"I don't think so this is a orginal JBL earphone
I see lebel there it was a made in china
And JBL is American company please do not buy I request",3
"The only problem I see is that it easily pops out of ears , dosent have that grip may be it can be to my ears shape .
Overall its a decent product",3
"Nice product.

The charger is not working and not fitting in the base properly.
The base of the charger is not designed well.
If you put the watch in the base of the charger its not fitting comming out",3
I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR GETTING HIGH RANG. AS IT IS HAVING 300MBPS AND TWO ANTINA BUT IT IS NOT GIVING RANGE AS COMPARED TO 150 MBPS ROUTER OF OTHER BRAND.THIS IS THE ONLY DRAW BACK.,3
Didn't got HDMI cable mentioned in product description.,3

After 15 pages its speed very slow.",3
Product is good for by utilities & m' satisfied.,3
Almost everything is good but only thing is.. battery life.. it’s draining more.. in 1and half day total 100% drained,3
No a very good phone. Many other options available in market at this price range. It's ok phone at this price range.,3
On this budget it was nice,3
This app not properly working,3
The wireless connection manual is not supplied with product. We have to search in manufacturer site.,3
Good products,3
"The print quality is alright for a home printer which is expected from hp. Even at this price point, there is no automatic duplex printing which is a shame and also means your paper cost will go up. The ink is not on the cheaper side and if you're going to print say more than 25 pages a month, you'll regret buying this.",3
"The treble is good, bass okay, and the wire quality is okayish. Good for the price range. I bought for 550rs.",3
"This mobile heats up after 15 minutes of watching videos, often reboots on playing videos.",3

Using since Monday after mi band 3. It has lot of new features but calculations are not good. Even while walking it stops. Automatic detection happen after 4-5 mins of walk.,3
"1. sound quality
sound quality of this headphone is impressive . treble and vocal is excellent but the bass is little bit decent.
2. durability
durability of this headphone is very bad . truely this is my 3 rd no. purchase . i have purchased nearly 3 months ago but now right earphone is not working . i don't know why it is happend with me? no one headphone is lasting more than 5 months . i purchased this headphone bcz the sound quality .",3
Display and over all good,3

2) Speed : good
3) look for pebble gray: good
4)Touch: less sensitive touch
After use of 6 month it can has problem regarding mobile data it cannot remain on during voice call I called to mi customer care but no problem solved. There is software issue occurred for this mobile still no problem solved and no reply from customer care. So during buying this mobile check that data remain on during your voice call.",3

Working perfectly but it has issues when we try to connect noise fit app syncing issue is there and some time it don't detect my watch it takes more time than as ussual,3
Good watch in decent price... Should have given metalic body.. I can't receive notifications of incoming calls on the watch.,3
"Watch Product quality is good but required more functional in Noise Fit mobile app. Also, looks like it's overpriced.",3
"Not compatible with Apple devices and android cellphone
Software needs to be dual updated.
Difficulty in trouble shooting the device.
Very disappointed",3
I returned the product and now using samsung curved display with 1:3000 contrant ratio nd awesome picture..,3
LAN cable not provided .....! how we can configure this router ...?,3
"Liked the material and packaging, very premium and sturdy, came with extra earbuds.
However I wasn’t so impressed by the sound quality. If you’re someone like me, then this sharp treble and pitched quality may not be for you. I prefer more smooth and toned down sounds.",3
The print quality is good for low printing this can work fine,3
WiFi signal is average.,3
over all my rating is 3 improve the battry backup and net slow,3
Received the item with different charger set. It has quick charging but not showing with its charger. Quick charger shows with the different charger.,3
"Okay product. Accuracy needs to be worked upon. Any slight movement, even if one is sitting in a moving car, records as a step walked count. This results in inaccurate readings.",3
Okay not good,3
"HI , Seems bit late to give the feedback and to return . . .now come to know that D Link System is getting reset by itself after some time, have checked myself and with BSNL wifi center office as well,

want to return or change the product , pls help ASAP",3
"I have 2 hp printers. Very complex to setup and configure. If you are tech-savvy you may be able to install and configure drivers , still it will be pain . Need to add and search for printers and drivers every now and then, Please keep this in mind before buying. See if there are other options which are easy to setup, else will give you a nightmare",3
JBL is losing it's quality. I was a JBL user for too long. But they are comprising quality for the price nowadays. Recently tried BoAt headphones from a friend and realised I could get better product for the same price. Hope JBL come up with better product.,3
"Watch hangs at least twice in a day. It would not start even after pressing the home key button once its stuck, and comes back to life after 30 to 40 seconds. The accuracy of the sleep tracking isn't great. Display is the only great thing about this watch. If you are willing to pay 7000 INR just for the sake of AMOLED go for it. In my opinion its isn't worth the price. Had it been priced around 5000INR, would have been a better deal, Tail note: Watch is way much better than Realme watch S",3
"Don't expect too much from this product.
1. Low internet speed over wifi. I am getting highest download speed 15-20mbps on my 50mbps plan.
2. Wifi range is equivalent to my old dlink single antenna router.
3. Internet speed is fluctuating, but it maintains contuinity on PPPoE connection.
4. If you are tight on budget, go for it else I'll recommend TP-Link Archer C20 AC750.",3
It's average,3
"Although it's got added features, the accessibility of them is inconvenient. Added features do not really add much utility to the product. The design is squarish rather than roundish (as in mi band 3) which reduces it's looks in my opinion. Probably serves the purpose just sticking to mi band 3.",3
"Ok for a relatively cheap pair.
Nothing great, but not horrible either",3
Fingerprint reader is not working at sometime and phone mic not work at something,3
"The watch is good but the most advertised feature “Blood Pressure Monitor” is extremely inaccurate. The reason I brought this watch over other available options in the market is because of BP Monitoring feature which is not at all reliable. It always shows my BP within normal range but I have high BP problem and I know that it’s not accurate. I have monitored my BP though this watch and it always gives the reading 119-78 (+- 5) but at the same time when I measured it from a BP machine it came around 140/96 which is a huge difference and it can’t be relied upon.
Data Sync works only through a Chinese app.
Notifications works fine in iOS but call actions doesn’t work.
SpO2 reading are accurate.
Pulse rate monitor also works fine.",3
"You can see the product is really low priced JBL headphone. So if u r expecting a good quality just because it's a JBL then it's not I'll say. That's the reason why it is cheap.

You can get a decent sound with good noise isolation, but the loudness, bass are compromised, because it has smaller sound drivers. Also earbuds are little harder compared to others.

So, if don't go for it just because it's a JBL. Please prefer slightly upper priced products. The sound quality depends on your budget.",3
"Just ok smartphone nothing is great,",3
"In printer cartage not good
Waste of money",3
Good for small rooms.,3
Product was damaged inside from corner but all the functions operated by remote is working properly instead of manual. Sound quality of speakers and woofer is average.,3
"Noise Cancellation is useless even in surrounding People can listen what you are listening. Bass Quality is awesome.
And Sound is also so good at this price range.
But only thing I hate is the noise Cancellation.",3
"Bought two watches together.
One is working nicely, other one is really bad in terms of battery life. Trying to replace it within warranty period. Plz help",3
Thanks,3
We buy 5 phones to my family and relatives. All are working well. The battery stands well and camera is in good quality and finger print works nice but sometimes not working in wet fingers..,3
Front Camera is poor and phone get stuck too much,3
"Built quality are perfect 👌

All others are awesome 😄
Smooth finish 😍
Good battery life 🙂",3
"I found the product reasonably priced, and it does it job well for that price.
I am currently in the complimentary stage of my membership, so will need to figure how it works after that lapses.
The Goqii coach is interested in your well-being, and there are active interactions.

The mobile app interface is a bit clunky. I still cannot read my trends easily.
Also the tracker keeps losing sync with the app consistently.",3
Firstly i recieved defective product then after replacement i got the right product which is quite good but audio quality is not that much good because i expect much better sound performance by boat as a sound product and my experience .,3
I had taken this to work in a 1012 Sq. ft flat. It doesn't reach the cornermost room. Though this product is rated to work for 1800 sqft. Pls note the effectiveness will vary drastically depending on the walls present.,3
"These headphones gave good sound clarity and bass when i connected to my computer but when i connected it with my mobile, clarity remained the same but the volume and bass were on lower side.",3
"Despite all the apps, this printer is not very easy to work with on wi-fi. Used it sparingly, but regularly, still had to call customer care multiple times. However the issue now is that nozzle is blocked for the past several months. It is exactly one year and it is out of warranty.",3
"Good in this price point but if you are purchasing them to hear songs then don't go for them, there is no bass at all in these earphones.",3
Not fast print,3
"Got it for 2499 during Independence day sale.
Amazon took 8 days to dispatch it and delivered it the 10th day (worst delivery experience till date.)
The product came in the original Zebronics packaging.
The sound quality was OK.
I would say OK because it was not very good as a 4.1 channel speaker should be.

Pros:
RGB lights look beautiful.
Bluetooth connectivity is good.
The sound is loud enough.
The speaker's cable length is more than 1mtr each.

Cons.
The woofer doesn't have a bass controller.
There were no batteries for the remote.
The small speaker's sound is not loud enough hence the bass overtakes the trebles.

Now the problem begins
I was not satisfied by the quality so I decided to return it and optend for a refund.
The pickup date was 5 days late so I thought I can listen till the pickup date.
BUT the speaker stopped working the same day while listening to music.
Only the RGB lights were on, the display / indicator didn't even turn on again.
That was a DEFECTIVE ITEM.",3
Print expensive,3
I liked,3
Band is displaying my HR at about 150 bpm at any time I check. Also 1026 steps in just 4 mins of walking within room. I dont know what to do with this now.,3
Best laptop for students and online marketing,3
Not that much good as expected,3
"If you have 1000 rs go for this ,if your budget is more find some other",3
This phone not use camera purpose . I am not satisfied this phone . Overall not good this price range . But samsung M series mobile overall better .,3
"I received the product one day before the expected date. Well done Amazon.
The product is fine, although it heats up a bit.
It's really light weight.
The LAN cable is really flimsy ,and not so tough.It could've been better.
The range is not too good vertically.
I installed it on the ground floor and the range on a first floor room, diagonally opposite to the router is really weak.",3
"Overall a good product under 3k
Loved its bass
Awesome sound.....💥💥💥",3
It is the best phone in this price....,3
After disconnecting the headphones from mobile. Mobile sounds are not coming,3
Ink exhausts too early,3
"Everything is good except the ppi
it is low even a text is looking pixelated
previously i used dell 2416h but this monitor is disappointing me .....",3
"Bought it in August, got it replaced within 10 days for another one. It kept cutting off my internet and I had to restart it to get internet again. Couldn't do it all my life so got it replaced. I'm guessing it was a defective product.

Replacement got me a new one of the same model, which worked fine for some days but then starting having the same issues as the first one.
It's NOT the ISPs fault, its the router! Go for another router!

Also, don't let the 3 antennas fool you! It has pathetic range! I live in a decent size flat, which my earlier single antenna router could cover, but this one can't even cover more than half the house!

Regret buying this!",3
"Speedy delivery , in 2 days.
For ₹499 (after discount) JBL, don't expect much. Better bass than a local 299 product. Ear bud insertion is good. Right for me.
My wife is happy now, when she got a ₹ 999 Brand headset. Ya.. I'm happy too.",3
"Product finish & sound quality is good..

Bluetooth range too small, 3m in front of smart TV sound was cracking..

Size too small for me, even with max possible extend of earpieces.. but my daughter wanted one, so not returning..",3
There is no user guide and warranty card in the box ! I am so disappointed.. I want the warranty card .,3
Bass is not good,3
"Step count/Rope jumping/ yoga/Running not giving correct results,not worth for money",3
Printer is good . every function is super but the cartage prints only 200 pages and the coast of cartage is very high,3
But it's totally worth the money,3
"Although the product has some real cool features which includes the bass, power back-up and passive noise cancellation but the company failed to provide a good quality wire. In the place of a flat wire they have replaced with a normal wire.",3
It was worth money .. Just mic is not upto the mark 😂..,3
"If this could been with double side printing then it could have been the best printer for home. even though it has latest future of WIFI printing from mobile, but not have dual side print will waste of paper.",3
"I fitted ink tank to this printer externally, since catridge is expensive.",3
"my bad luck
i bought 3 product but all are faulty this is not company fault i think that day was my bad day
go for it
this headphone is good not bad
only same issue i felt from this
but ok ok ok go for it",3
Like PVR sound all quality is very good thank you boat and Amazon you are amazing for me provide like this headphone in lowest price.,3
"Great band, if you have Mi smart band 3 then don't go for it, but if you don't then you must try it. Awsome battery power.
(Edit): It stopped responding to touch in March 2020 and order was placed on 13 December 2020.",3
Though this is a high end router with multiple features Range of the router is not so good and it doesn't even cover 900 sft as opposed to the advertised ie. up to 1800sft. Please do consider this before buying. I am not sure why their is no emphasis coverage even in the sepc section which is a key criteria in buying any wifi router. A router like this is expected to cover larger area so it would be better if their is more clarity on this part.,3
"Received my product yesterday. Looks amazing at first instance. However, I faced bit difficulty in signing and pairing it. It took me almost an hour and go through different videos for assistance to finally make it through. I wish will have better experience with the features offered by the band. Took a snap of watch faces offered by mi, happy to see so much option.",3
"Not the best watch , but has some great features ..",3
"These are the good earphones at this price.
Noice cancellation is slightly low. You can use it while working out, sound quality is average..",3
The biggest issue is they don't stay in ears. You have to keep them fixing and forcing them into ears. The volume is also not so high.,3
Received a damaged product. One of the lower edges is smashed slightly and I had not noticed it. Bass is not working. Unfortunately I had gifted the product and the defrcts were noticed aftef the return window was closed.,3
Sync issue I m facing. There was update on Noise pro app while updating again and again sync failed. After full download. Not understand why?? Just purchased so don't give more feedback..,3
It will coverage of 15-20ft,3
"Single strength is poor when you go away. Mine is duplex house, I had placed my router in 1st floor I wont get signal in ground floor",3
Phone looks good but it is too heavy and lagging a lot while switch between apps.. Charging capacity is too good..,3
"I have successfully installed this router, but I have problem with some websites from wifi connected devices.
Its MTU issue, I configured and manage to resolve this on laptop by changing mtu for wifi driver through cmd. But same is not possible for wifi connected smartphone.
That's why not able to load multiple websites from wifi connected devices, i.e. smartphones

Otherwise this router is ok.",3
Ink consumption is on the higher side a bit. Perfect for home and small office.,3
Stopped working not long after purchase .,3
"Under 9000 rs this is a good choice , but I would like 2go with Samsung M11

Just ok product

Many more things to update yet

I just buy because made in India
2.7 star rsting",3
"It's been a month or so. The product looks good but not as useful as I assumed it would be. One has to remember to switch on the modes everytime like walking/running etc so it doesn't automatically track. Also the heart rate isn't very accurate. Overall the design is quite nice and works very basic. Don't seem to get call notifications for some reason.
The product developers can definitely work on the shortcomings so it's a seamless experience.",3
Cartrige cant be refieled ad set again,3
Install very worst cd not comfortable,3
"Range is not good even for 2.4ghz. Overall, not recommended until and unless required for a small space",3
Best build quality..bass is low but..ok .. if u'r improve bass quality.. one of the best air buds this price range..and improve touch quality..,3
I have 2 BHK only and with my old router (actually that was new) TPLink845 i was not getting good signal in my bedroom corner on my desk (50MBPS connection was showing approx 10-13MBPS) - so my net provider suggested this one with dual band. With this I am able to get very poor signal of 5GHz band and good signal of 2.4GHz signal. But in i am getting 35MBPS. And when bedroom door is closed it falls to 10-12MBPS earlier it was approx 5-7MBPS. Hence not much benefitted.,3
It didn't work well on aux cable speakears were not working properly,3
Charging issues... No charging support with 2months. want to complain for claiming warranty,3
Good product but only issue is that cartridges are too small and hold very less ink even on refilling. Cost of new cartridge is too high. Economy printer should have reasonably priced cartridges.,3
"Smart band not sync with mobile.
I feel like foolish to choose for bought it .🥵",3
"Touch screen is not responding properly.Screen is also flickering....very disappointed...even Samsung devices are lowering their quality standards, don't know why.",3

Frequently pairing got disconnected. Unable to change watch faces. Tried for return/replacement but unable to do like other products. Request solution,3
"Thumbs up for fast delivery from Amazon.
There are few points I want to mention
Packing is very ordinary compare to previous model of mi band these are just packing like cheap item.
Charging cable is very different from mi band 3 and earlier model causing difficulties when you have same company products.
Battery is not that much optimized battery percentage drops 20 percentage in 3 days of usage I've got at 44% charge now it's at about 20% in just 3 days with ordinary usages and no continuos ❤️ rate.
The difference between screen and display is clearly visible made it looks like cheap.
Screen is difficult to see in sunlight
Still steps are counted in cars by fast moving. There are problem needs to rectify by some software update.",3

Call notification not disappears from watch after receiving call from mobile. Its very bad to manually mute notification of watch. While driving you should manually check the time evry time because of notifications not disappears automatically. Should improve this other wise ok.,3
"1.Phone is very poor in network grasping. While talking in call usually network turns off and call gets disconnected, when other phones of same sim has full network.
2. After 4 months of buying new problem arised Internet doesnot work when i on mobile data, No 4G/LTE ..",3
It's nice but cartridge is less,3

"I was advised by the doc not to use ear phones that go inside the ear, so I opted for this after reviews. I am using it with the Samsung phone. Not sure if the phone is bad, or network coverage is bad - since i started using it, no one is able to hear anything properly; i am not able to hear them also properly - had to disconnect calls multiple times. Finally, i ditched this headset, and am just holding the phone close to my ear and going without using hands-free.",3
"Not as good as expected compared to boat rockerz 600. The head band is not comfortable, the plastic part looks cheap. The only thing I like is the foldable part, very compact and the cable is very good. Over all it's below average. Don't buy it if the price is higher than 700 - 800 at this price you can get a Ubon wireless headphone eith sd card slot and fm plus the sound quality is almost the same like boat bassheads 900.",3
"Not worthy. I exchanged my real mi u1 for this note 9. But disappointed.
Display quality very bad
Camera is not as 48mp
My recommendation ,go for other device in this price range.",3

When you're at 11th photocopy, job takes at least one min for each copy further. I used office printers before but this one is too slow. Rest everything is fine with this.",3
"No complaints with respect to sound quality, but its uncomfortable to wear for long time.. not able to use more than 30 minutes",3
"The only problem I felt is you cannot use it for longer periods , I tried to use for guided meditation and workouts but have to take out at max after 15 min. May be this problem is with me only. Bluetooth , battery life good and sound quality satisfactory for this price.",3
"Below expectations sounds muddy but ensure that thumpy bass along with vibration, it depends on volume above it tends to distort and sound start throttling and beg for mercy.

Below mentioned score will justify the Headphones

Low : 3/5
Battery Backup : 4.5/5

In my usage i found this to be average and quite surprised with bass",3

SLOW PRINTER,3
The charging time is usual as in other phone. The claimed charging speed is failed. Standby battery life also less than claimed one.,3
"Good product,
but accuracy is poor... Battery backup is 10 days not 14 days..
And stpes accuracy is 50% not 100%",3
I bought it almost 1.5 year back for around 1000 bucks. It was good for initial one year. Now it is giving me major problem. It gets disconnected and I have to restart it every now and then.,3
Camera quality is not so good and Lagging issues are there...,3

I wish 5ghz also had the same range as 2.4ghz",3
"I bought from Amazon and i found that display is bit yellowish compared to normal screen, i chech the settings but it is still the same. It also affect the camera result.

I demanded replacement but as per Amazon executive and test check by some app they suggested that it can not be replaced and phone is fine.

Disappointed with the service.",3
I bought this product assuming that this would amplify the bass in the music i listen to.. but instead it's reducing the bass levels.. in every thing i listen to.. but the rest of the sound quality is crisp enough to earn a 3 to 4 star rating. The noise cancellation is pretty good.,3
"Steps are not much accurate and not worth for money ,no spo2,very less features and un used features",3
camera quality is very low lekin thanks to @Amazon app to fast delivery.,3
"Very bad battery backup.
Discharged within 2-3 days..",3
Brought this after losing my Sennhieiser cx 180 and cx 275s. The sound quality is ordinary and no where comparable to these good brands.,3
"I bought the camera directly from a Store in Bangalore and after 4 days display started giving problem. (there were several horizontal lines in the display). I have given the camera to the service center and they assure me of complete replacement within 10days.
Hope I get a new camera body.
I am yet to explore the camera and hope this is as good as what I see/read in the review.",3
"I like the sound quality on this one but I still feel that my Mi In-ear capsules have a much better sound signature. The low notes are not quite clear and audible in this one. The build quality also can be improved a bit. Overall, a very good pair of earphones for the price.",3

"Mobile charger getting heat after connecting 5min.
I decided to replace the product and i fill all details and send it Amazon now they are saying we didn't receive any returns message from my side..... Better you go to serive center and claim there only we are help less.",3
"The product is good for this budget. Sound quality with noise cancellation is above average. Bass is average but good. If you get this product within ₹1000/- then it's not a bad deal. One minor drawback is the build quality, it's not that strong, you can hear creaks when you put it on your ears. Also my ears started hurting in about 30mins of use even though with cushion.",3
Bad warranty policy ..my one side of earphone isn't working and their policies in warranty doesn't require its meet ..they literally said you have done this ...like why tf i do that,3
"Reading for BP, HR, SPO2 No at all accurate. Step count is near to accurate.Battery is good but disappointed with only 8 watch faces.
Over all not helping with health readings.",3
Looks very cheap. you can buy an advanced/better mobile by adding two-three thousand to your budget.,3
Buy it,3
"So I got this product and after opening it was not quite satisfying because the watch has lot of bazels and the dial doesn't bhave edge to edge display it was quiet disappointment but overall if you look it is okay. Below are some pros and cons

Pros:-
It's very light weight
Tracking and app looks somewhat familiar
And it's water proof.

Cons:-
Looks very small on Big wrist
Always on display is missing
Battery is somewhat 5-6 days if you used outdoor with hight brightness.
GPS is missing
Amazfit Bip U pro is coming with GPS and much more features so you can wait for this.",3

"Hi,
Today this earphones have been delivered to me. Here is my review after hearing few songs in it.

1. Packing of this order is too bad
2. No bass heard in this headphones. Sound in this earphones is like cheap quality earphones. Bass is zero. I connected this to my OnePlus 7T mobile, even though sound heard is very poor.
My suggestion is to go for good brand, even their price bit more than this.
3. Even there is no seal for the pack, looks like it is already opened.",3
"Printer is good.
But tank is high cost and print up to 3000 black pages and 1000 color pages",3
Overall good product.,3
"Every day I am cycling 20 km. The watch is not properly configured with mobile at the end of cycling it shows 5 km, 9km etc. On what basis the watch calculate calories burn. Even it is surprised me...
These parameters must be updated from amezfit site..
Also GPS for running is full network and for cycling is very low GPS.
HOW IT IS POSSIBLE IF I AM SITTING IN SAME PLACE.",3
Highly inaccurate step counter. Defeated the purpose of buying it. Now it's just serving the job of a digital watch.,3

It is not very good ...,3

Well I bought this 3 months back and right ear bud stopped working. My Friend also bought the same model and his stopped working in 5 months. So if you're looking for long lasting earphones DON'T BUY THIS. otherwise the earphones are good with good sound quality.,3
The product is good but it's space consuming if you have a small living room than it won't look good.,3
I was using 4gb mobiles but never got slowness issue in typing. And this 6gb mobile starts giving me slowness issue in typing.,3

"Three Stars.It's a good product, but the MRP on the strips is Rs 550/- per 25 strips, which is rather expensive. You get Accuchek 50 strips for Rs 625/- for example.
Thank you for seeking feedback.",3
The battery is not good. They mentioned that it can use up to 9 days. But it's work's only 2 days after full charging,3
The product is an easy install and ready to use one. The limitation of it is its durability. My first piece worked for 14 months and died on a day. Needed to buy a new one considering the battery replacement. So consider the investment for a year and be ready to buy another one in a year span.,3
"Noise Colorfit pro-2 is a sub par product. The sportsmode stopped working the very next day. Additionally, the screen wouldn’t come alive with hand movements. We returned the faulty piece and received a new one. Encountered same problems once again. Looks like the Company is testing its beta versions at the cost of the Customers.",3
POOR FOR BIG HOMES,3
"Observation after 1 month
- Good camera and display
- battery backup is satisfying
- average gaming performance
- Charger Stopped working",3
"Phone showing 48 megapixel camera but photos are like 8 megapixel. If you want a good camera phone then you should think about it. Processor is not the best but it can handle all your work, if you don't play games then it's okay . But you should consider ones for the phone",3
paper get struck everytime and the printer uses too much ink coz the cartridges are also over... I received it on 2nd June ..and in 6 weeks the problem start..,3

Performance of phone is not good rest of all is ok,3
Camera quality is poorer,3
"I'm not satisfied with the sound quality and treble management of this earphone, the sound is somewhere unpleasant , bass is good but it has way more treble then it should have. Sound management is the only purpose of earphone, which in this case is not good",3
Good value as it was on sale. The plug for the chord is designed poorly and it can break or lose internal connection easily. Would recommend a detached plug in system even if it costs a bit more.,3
Mobile App is not that good however watch is very good in reading stress calculating calories burnt during workout.,3
"The downside sensor is protruding which causes pain if you wear it for long time.
Battery life is ~8 days

Screen bleeding issue in every corner,3
Blietooth issue,3
All is things best but i show screen bleed on uper side if,3
Only good for music and if you have DJ taste. No control for bass which makes movie experience really bad. All I could hear is high thumping sound with no clarity on dialogues. Wish i could return it.,3

Good for very small room,3
"Well, the hp 2700 delivered initially had problems with the paper feed. The paper was pulled to one side and got crumpled inside. Amazon team was kind to give replacement within 48 hours. The replacement (same model) was tested and is working fine. Quality control needs to be in place either at HP end and before delivery.",3
Fp reader not provided.. A big drawback.,3

Not a good packaging
Looks like old one",3
"The wifi router has a 100mbps wan port so basically if you have a 100mbps or more isp connection it basically will give you only 100mbps, while the archer c50 can give up to 1000mbps. so go for it, don't look at the 867mbps and other stuff that is just marketing.",3
Delete option is not working properly,3
"Product is too much for this price but volume very low,only suitable for small room",3
NOT SO COOL SOUND AS COMPARED TO (ZEBRONICS BT SPEAKER 4.1) BUT GOOD ? I RECOMMENDED ZEBRONICS BT 4.1,3
"The product is good.But there is some mismanagement from Dlink. Or the vendor. I received a product burned with firmware specific to Hathaway cable provider. (v20.10) It did not work with my ISP. I had to contact 3 different dlink support engineers to figure out this issue and change to generic firmware(v20.07). After changing firmware it worked like a charm.

One issue I found is with the WAN link LED. It always shows green when cable is connected even when the link is down. It should show RED in that case. Looks like another careless firmware issue.",3
Good product but takes more ink and pages incertion sucks,3
"Battery life is not good.
Camera is not good as expected by Samsung Brand.",3

"Connection issues ,always cam shows offline status ..even wifi signal is strong..will not recommend.",3
WIFI signal is not good. Always ups and downs...,3
It’s a waste of money at all guys,3
Its getting hanged..touch pad not working properly..,3
Camera Quality Low,3
Products quality is good but it shouldn't be priced more than 500. Also the wire is not tangle free it's super messy,3
"The sound output was ok but the unit started malfunctioning within 10 days of buying, the bass effect has completely gone off. Before going off, the bass was unstable for some moment.",3

Camera quality is pathetic... battery life is no doubt good...,3
The sound quality is just not good at all.. but it has good noice cancellation and these are very light weight.,3
Normal headphone for general purpose.it's left side stopped after 6 month.,3

"Phone looks great but has sound issues, phone is hanging which ideally with 4 gb ram should not happen.",3
Ok Product in this price range,3
This is a good product from dlink for home/small office consumers. Steady performance and good coverage for small to medium sized home. It takes some time (more than usual) to get connected to the internet after powering it on. Otherwise met my expectations.,3
With the price it's definitely a good product.,3

Catrige is too costly,3
"Ear cushion is worst. I found 1500 Rupees boat having a great quality material, user as cushion. Disappointed with this purchase. Expected better quality from sony. Doubtful if this is an original product.",3
Value for money with good bass and decent noise cancellation. Cons are the ear cushions are not soft enough so one can feel discomfort and pain on the ears even using it for a short period of time. boAt needs to take this feedback and improve.,3
"I feel this headphone can be better quality in terms of physical as well as sound. Physical quality doesn't look like JBL, it's a bit like local product. In terms of sound, there is no noise concelation, hence sound effect is not upto mark.",3
"The print quality is good. But there are some other issues with the printer -
- Setting it up is difficult
- does not support auto duplex printing or manual duplex in Mac.
- Makes lots of noise.
- No Airprint support
- No LCD dispaly

Fortunately Amazon accepted a return on this one , so returned it and went for the new 3020 with much better features.",3
If this device has a slot for the sim which supports all networks 4g to 5g maximum of the people will use this device instead of broadband and any other internet facilities.. by that people who like to carry a wifi data device will definately in love with it.. so requesting to bring a new device with a good price...,3
"Before I offer my critique about the product, I would first want you to know that products below 1,000rs are known to be limited by something.

If you've used any headset before and were pleased with the sound quality, then you wouldn't like the Cloak.
The headset has some very important flaws that competitive gamers need to consider:
1. It's got low sound output.
2. Directional sounds are not clear. Sometimes when the enemy is on the left, the sound may seem as though coming from above or below.
3. Muffling sound. When firing weapons, the audio can drop to a very low level.
4. The headset doesn't know how to handle multiple audios. It tries to compensate by automatically lowering the volume of multiple audio.

The better part about the headset includes:
1. A decent microphone
2. Comfortable
3. Cost-efficient
4. RGB lights

However, notice that the headset is first a good audio delivery tool instead of a style element.

If you have been gaming for over 2+ years, I wouldn't recommend this headset.",3
"because there was a small irritating sound that was ruining any experience
it's preferable to go for something a little more expensive (around 700 or 800

all and all it would be a good product if there was no irritating sound",3
This gets heated very often due to which it stops working. Need restart frequently.,3
"Watch looks is good, strap is also fine,battery life is alo very good 7 to 8 days battery backup for normal usage , activity tracking is average the only worst thing is the zoise app it sucks lags every time spoiles all the fun using the app apart from that watch itself is a good purchase",3
I had one and ordered one more as I needed it for my kid. First one was good. Second one came with a 16 Amp plug. It does not for into any socket now. Need to buy a separate power chord,3
Don’t buy this if you are planning to get more than 100mbps speed. This WiFi doesn’t have LAN bandwidth above 100 mbps,3
Quality and built is good.performance 7/10 for the price its very nice.,3

"I purchased these earphones just because of a ""JBL Brand"" & a microphone provided.
Sound quality is good, Vocals are clear but don't expect any extra bass.
I bought it for Rs. 699 & within a month price dropped to Rs. 549. I was pretty disappointed because of this.",3
This is average in price range. You won't be disappointing but also no wonder. I'm telling you this because I bought another earphones in same range this is not better then that. Fyi Boult Space I'm talking about.,3
Quality & durability is not so good,3

Nice product.Great product,3
Its is good,3

Sound quality,
bass,

Comfortable

What is not good
- air caps teared after few months of normal use
- few times mic voice wasn't that audiable to other side during meeting",3
EVERY THING IS FINE BUT COST OF PRINT IS TOO MUCH HIGH. DON'T BUY IF PRICE CONSIOUS. 30 PRINT COST IS 450 RS.,3
Does the job but not exactly a great range. Could not receive proper signals in the room next to the one where I kept it. So I had to use extension cord to move it to my room,3
Hardware wise it's a perfect laptop. But after a week of use I'm disappointed that it's slow. Actually it's very slow.,3
"Beware.. Don't just look at the cost.
This mobile does not have gyroscope sensor. So you cannot view VR (virtual reality) Google VR app is not compatinle with this mobile.

Also there is no infrared so you cannot use the MI remote to operate TV, SET TOPBOX Or Your AC.",3
Fingerprint sensor not so fast and not easy to place finger at there and data transfer between laptop to mobile is not fast 300mb taking more than 1 min,3
"I bought it from an offline store after comparing couple of more speakers in similar range. Also l bought this because unlike a few other Philips model, it's not made in China...it's made in India 😊My verdict will be as below:

1. Sound: Sound quality is really good, clarity is nice with no distortion. However I would prefer the volume to keep in mid-range (17 to 22), even the low is quite nice and you can listen to your favourite music at as low as 3 with adequate clarity and bass. That's a good thing about this speaker.

2. Bass: Just adequate, not too much not too low. You can adjust the bass to your liking. What I like about the bass is that it's pleasing to ears. However don't expect anything really punchy like some of the top brand like JBL. Overall you won't be disappointed.

3. Loudness: Sufficient, afterall you don't want your neighbours to complain!

4. FM: FM reception is average and clarity as well. There is an inbuilt antenna which you need to adjust. What I was disappointed to see that you cannot store a FM station to a particular number as per your preference. It just has automatic tuning option and channels will be stored to a particular number from 1 to 9 as it tunes. You can't change that.

5. Remote and Bluetooth: Bluetooth works as expected. But I am bit disappointed with the Remote as it seems to be slow and out of sync at times. For example if you change the volume, it may end up changing from blutooth mode to USB mode. There is a definite quality issue.

6. Build quality: Happy with the build quality.

Final verdict: So far really happy with my purchase, specially the sound quality. But I think it will be too early to comment as i can see some definite quality issues. Also already I can see few customer has complained about speakers stopped working after 1 to 4 months of time. I think here Made in India still needs to do a lots more catch-up with Made in China. I had one similar Philips home theatre which was made in China and ran like a charm for 7 years without any problem. I would have given a 4 Star without this quality issues.",3

2..If u guys are buying this for PHOTO EDITING and normal OFFICE WORK then Its Good

3..But DON'T BUY it for watching MOVIES and playing GAMES bcz it Shows CLOUDING effect (YouTube it) as discuss in point 1 above..

4. IPS panel used here is cheapest one that's why it's for 8k to 9k ..I recommend Go for higher range of IPS panel for perfect picture quality..

5...If u can compromise picture quality for budget then buy it ..otherwise don't buy it .bcz it's not perfect budget monitor as u will expect..

6...I also replaced monitor but then to this issue (point 1 ) persist ....and this ISSUE PERSIST IN EVERY LG22MP68VQ monitor bcz the IPS PANEL is same in every unit of this model ...

"On screen fingerprint not working properly.
Battery life not that great. But charges fast.
Camera quality is ok. Lot of unwanted apps.
Screen should have been full HD.
Not so happy with the products.
Little costly as compared with other upcoming phones.
Comes with a tag Indian sim cards only. Which may make you worried.
Samsung not even providing screengaurd.",3
Bettery life is good,3
Well... To be honest the sound quality is good enough but the built quality in not upto the mark. Don't expect it to last long...,3
Wifi signal strength coverage is not good.,3
If you wear it on your hand it counts your footsteps by your hands movement. Its very disappointed me. Accuracy is low sometimes its not connected .,3
The music quality is good but the headset fits tight to skull and ears and you will start feeling pain after 2 hours of use..,3
Thank you Amazon happy with the product. Phone working good for now only problem is heating issues while charging and playing pubg,3
I want do the wallpaper as my picture.,3
So far good.,3
Lower configuration so sort of slow performance wise.,3
Product is decent . But could be wow if bass control will present...,3
It good but there is no number lock like mi band 4,3
This is not a duplex model. Beware in product description it was mentioned as duplex,3
"I bought this product only to have 4k 60fps but it's not.
Under setting you can see 4k60fps but when you see recorded video information. it show 30fps only.

THERE IS NO 4K - 60 FPS in this camera , I request company technical guy to tell me how can I record 4k - 60fps in this i6 pro...otherwise need to return this...",3
"Picture quality is good.
Brightness is high even at the lowest setting.
Fine print is difficult to read due to high brightness.",3
Pages rolling and show door not closed error.,3
Nice battery backup,3
ok ok product,3
"Syrprisingly the 2.4Ghz band that is supposed to have greater range than 5 Ghz band, actually has less range! My stupid phone doesn't have 5ghz support and so I have trouble finding a good signal two rooms over. But my wife's phone that has 5 Ghz support, gets good to average 5Ghz signal at the same place!",3
Run Distance not Track Properly,3
ITEM WORKING PROPERLY BUT WIFI RANGE SLOW DOWN WHILE ENTER OTHER ROOM. CAN ANYBODY TELL ME TO EXPAND WIFI RANGE UPTO 30-50 METERS. IS IT POSSIBLE ?,3
Good and don't buy for video recorder,3
Not satisfied I had to buy Tenda WiFi router,3
Don't expect to much from speakers,3
Better battery.. Camera quality can be improved,3
This has thrashed my expactations. Sound is not up to the mark. There is no clarity in sound. Bass is more. Sound gets distorted at higher levels. Level is 30 but not such loud.,3
good product value for money use normal product nice ek problem hai ismein calling system smart watch no calling MI band 4 waste for money,3
"Definitely not the best....it's good at this price...
I feel like the sound quality of the left ear bud is not quite good. I could feel the difference. Sometimes it causes discomfort.

Bass quality is average .
Sound quality is not that good",3
WiFi signal is poor if I sit in my bedroom and try to access the WiFi placed behind my bedroom wall in hall,3
"If u want clean voise .... Less noise ..smooth highs and lows...you wont get all of this in them.U might wanna spend around 3000 to get such experience.
More oevr bass is not taht powerful, but it works for me as i dont like bass that much. Go with sony if u like bass.
That being said..it delivers balanced sound which makes it a good buy at the price.",3
Poor quality may be i have received the fake product..i have returned it though Amazon's return policy is great..😛,3
It is a good wi-fi router.It is very easy to install.It's size is also small so we can keep it any were.It is a good product.I am using from past 6months.,3
Good battery life but display area is small. It will not work without first pairing with mobile App. There is no provision in the watch to reset the steps data. Strap lock does not easily fit in the perforation. One needs to exert pressure to Lock the strap.,3
It is good but not promising that it's signals are strong we have 1 BHK flat and bedroom is so closer then also only 2 lines come in signal.....not satisfied 👎,3
For me small used good product .,3
"Loat problem Epson l3110 printer

better to go for replacement.",3
"Cost is low but even with low cost, better products are available.",3
Good👍,3
Good sound quality but no bass....but after adding equilizer it provide good bass also in computer....,3
"I ordered it on 18/10 and it was delivered to me on 25/10. Bought it on introductory price.Now, firstly there was only one colour available gor ordering that is black. I personally wanted to buy Sakura pink, 🤩nevertheless it is okay as it was on available on cheap rates.Secondly, packing was okay with no outside damages.I am not an expert but saw some flaws and some amazing stuffs about this watch while using it for 7 days.I paired it with an apple iPhone. Zepp app was up to date and compatible with IOS. I personally, liked the app.
I was earlier using HONOR BAND 5( A beast band).
Pros:
1) Great price range i.e ₹ 3500. 2) Very light plastic body, doesn’t feel like wearing even for 24 hrs but I found the strap of very cheap quality and basically feels like rubber. 3) SCREEN- it’s amazing. It was very clear even outside the sun. 4) some amazing features like SLEEP - i found it very accurate every time. 5) Another good feature was CYCLE TRACKING- good for women.😘 6)REMOTE PHOTOGRAPHY - it was easy to capture pictures from phone using this. 7) ALARM/WORLD CLOCK/POMODORO- Works fine. 8) Lots of exercising modes, good for fitness freaks.
Cons:
1)BUILT QUALITY- okay for 3500 but not for 6000. If you want to go for 6000 price range , go for other options. 2)BATTERY- Died on 5th day, even when not using PAI MODE. So it is a gimmick to say it lasts up to 9 days( maybe draining due powerful screen). 3) PEDOMETER- not accurate with fluctuations of 200-300 steps. 4) HEART RATE MONITOR- Doesn’t gave proper readings every time. Out of 10, 5-6 are accurate.
5) SpO2- it is great features taking present pandemic in mind. But it is not accurate, always gave below 95 and near 89-90 level. 6) It easily disconnects with phone so for me music controlling was a little tiring task from it. 7) may be it’s connectivity range is up-to 8 or less meters. 8) And I receive, all NOTIFICATIONS TWICE, I am still trying to figure it out why. 9) And it was very hard to get CALL NOTIFICATIONS . It took me 4 days to resolve it. 10) SCREEN- Susceptible to scratches
Final verdict- It is a fitness band with more features and bigger screen.
AND I tried to replace it but couldn’t connect with the Manufacturer even with repetitive tries.",3
I likt the bass but its mic and finishing quality of the product must improve and it should be more large to fit on head easily.,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 ok best",3
App is not user friendly.,3
Very well,3
Connect nahi raheti mobile app k satha roj connect karna padta hai,3
"Not a good product as per it's worth, picture quality I hate picture quality of this camera.",3
Inbuilt speaker volume is too low... Need to increase volume...,3
It is good for 2000 rupees budget with Bluetooth... But not good in bass effect ... zebronics given very low bass effect..... Are u bass effect lover go for Philips or f&d,3
Good product but the sound quality is not touching my expectations and the bass is worst 👎there is no base in it and the noise cancellation is also very bad 👎,3
Phone is nice for normal users. Battery life is good and phone is smooth to operate. But camera quality is not upto mark.,3
The cartridge is waste. The seller is fooling the customers saying free cartridge.,3
"Phone is slow in doing day today tasks, battery life is good, camera is average,

Verdict: look for other better options in same price range",3
As of price the print quality is not that good. Also print cost too high. But it's really easy too install... Overall you can go for other printers.,3
"There are lots of issues
I m writing this after using this phone for abt 15 days
1) started heating up during games and hang too
2) camera protection is not good... One of my lenses getting dust from inside and causing decrease in pic quality
3) battery life is good... Thumbs up for that
4) finger print reader and face lock is also not working well",3
"It worked like charm for a year but as soon as I completed 1 year, right side speaker stopped working. I guess, wire got damaged internally near the jack. Now I can not claim for replacement, since it has crossed the warranty period of 1 year, 5 days back.
Overall I was satisfied but I would say it's not durable.",3
Watch is not accurate it can lead serious demorality to anyone,3
"products is good , but costly for the value it gives.",3
Many features like call recording doesn't work well.,3
The watch gets unpaired frequently. And we need to sync again and again,3
"The headphones look nice and fit is comfortable and snug. But sound quality is not up to my expectations. Earler was using B&W P5 S2 headphones. The price difference of 20 k vs 8k is there, but still a 8k headphone was supposed to be good. It sounds sort of hollow and more tilted to low frequency band and hence the taught audio and clear high notes are missing.",3
"I don’t have any issue with sound however suddenly it stopped and never turned on.however my product is under warranty I talked to customer care they asked me to for warranty claim u have to send product by Indian post to company .
I think better we choose we product who give home pickup or have service centre.BAD experience in term of warranty claim.",3
"material quality and durability Is best in market but I didn't like the sound quality, as the sound reproduction is not natural. If are a in love with minute details of sound quality definitely it's not for you better go for sony. This is best for college guys for rap and kinda music. High bass at this price is a great advantage for them.",3
I have bought M12 mobile on Apr2021 and the cost of Rs.90000/-. It was working good and when you playing the games got struck up. So I'm strongly not recommended for game players.,3
"I am happy with the look of watch and irritated with the functions i.e. call & message alert and screen lighten up time duration.
I am using one plus 5 mobile and not getting call alert, message alert and it takes too much time to lighten up the display while move your wrist to see the time or other notifications.
Noise should be work on these glitches , if these glitches would be removed than this fitness band is worthy to buy.",3
Wast,3
Voice during calling is not clear.,3
Good router for this price. Speed of 5Ghz is good but the coverage distance is very less(around 10ft to 12ft). But I'm disappointed with 2.4Ghz although it has a very wide coverage area speed is very slow. Connected at a same distance I get 50Mbps on 5Ghz but only around 10 to 20Mbps on 2.4Ghz. Overall it's a good buy at this price as it covers a big duplex house without requiring any range extender,3
good product but doesn't have calling feature.,3
Speed is low compared to Tenda D303.,3
Okay but battery life is not up to the mark.,3
Fingerprint reader is fine,3
"Feature set is good, app is good for the price, looks and finish could hv been better..it has plastic feel to it, definitely no metal..like realme watch s finish better. Os and touch is lagging from week 1 itself, battery on average os 1week. Noise has to improve product greatly in next iteration.",3
"Touch screen sometime hang to move.. and display is disappointed.. above then 40 years couldn't watch display without eye strain.. But trenagers it is good.. and smart watch couldn't connecting regularly to mobile app.. Frequently bluetooth has been disconnecting.. Other than battery excellent in this budget.
Overal Good. But not satisfied.😣",3
"Bluetooth connectivity very slow ,,watch faces so lase ,,only 5 ///You cannot download also,//this is very bad things // i Hope Noise Company will update in the future / battery capacity is very bad ,,",3
I like this phone,3
"No accuracy in step counting .
Sleep monitor ok ok when i feel m not sleeping stil its count my sleep time .
Bluetooth connectivity too good no need to pair again again .
Pros :-watch faces, Bluetooth, display,multitasking activity tracker , battery backup upto 15 days with continued HR tracking.
Cons :- accuracy step, day time sleep monitor missing.",3
"Liked it, great product",3
"It enabled my Bluetooth automatically once it was successfully connected. I open my phone to see Bluetooth on and got scared about the security of the product. Because it has access to all notifications, phone calls, phone book, messages and every other thing on my phone. Hence returned it.",3
I found a failure in the sound of this product.,3
"It's good . But it's not even 3 months old. And inspite of handling it safely, one of the sides of the earphones came out from the mike. It has been said that it has a 1 year warranty period, can my product be exchanged!?",3
"Pros: Budget beast... Overall the performance of the speaker is good...
Cons: packaging from the Amazon is totally terrible...one side of the Sub woofer is little damaged...There is no batteries given for remote",3
"I am using this product for last 10 days basically I am a bass lover I am satisfied with bass but mids and vocals are not clear 5/5 for bass but about instrumental sounds and vocals and singer voice it scores 3/5
Next talking about battery it has 6 hours battery life
About build quality and looks it scores 5/5 expecially the colour matee black its looks like a primum model
Finally it is good except sound quality",3
"Router is good, but one problem is that suddenly disconnects when i am using firestick on TV, earlier i have used D-Link router - it was never disconnected... Apart from this overall is good...",3
All is well but camera quality is poor.,3
"At this price it’s a good buy
But why buy a product which inaccurately detects bpm and steps are counted even when travelling by bus.
Buy analog instead or if you want to collect data about your body buy Apple Watch or Fitbit",3
"Good product, but i thought that the picture comes with full view as a bezel less experience. But the reservations gets some blank space around the monitor that's why I can't enjoy as a basal this experience and some of the icons and their names is not totally visible because of the resolutions management is not so good but over I can say it's a good product.
Picture quality is good but I thought that more brightness I could see because it is called ""full HD display"".",3
Overall the MI Band 4 is of good quality but the charger isn't a good fit to the capsule. It falls off frequently while charging.,3
"Sound quality is good in terms of Bass. Satellites could be better. Material and Built quality is good. Remote response is very bad, you need to hold just in front of main unit.

I am using Phillips products for more than a decade but never seen such substandard product. There is only one Phillips batch on front grill of speakers. On the rear there is no branding or logo of Phillips. If front batch is removed, nobody can identify these as a product of Phillips. Same case with remote. Even RCA Cables are very low grade. This product seems to a localy manufactured with a Phillips branding. Even User Manual looks like a Black & White photocopy of original.

My previous Phillips products are old but far better than these. There is proper branding with Phillip's Logo on every part of product i.e Main unit, Speakers, Satellites Speakers, Remote Control and even Cables.",3
"Overall product is good.
Track heart rate.
Can receive mobile notifications.
Also, reminds to take activity.",3
"It could be just my experience that within 30 days of use the modem suddenly got powered off and did not power on again. Had to raise a replacement request.
Never expected such a short life of a new product. Still range of the wi-fi is good across the house even through 3-4 walls, so was satisfied, however product failure ended the satisfaction pretty soon.
2 extra star given only because of the D-Link Direct Service which couriers the replacement to your address, however its a re-furbished one. Still the warranty continues, which is a saving grace.",3
"Spo2 monitoring could be intermittent as battery is very low power for continuous monitoring.
Bought and delivered on 27 April and product is not charging.
Hope it gets fixed by the seller.",3
Data not accuracy...,3
"5Ghz range is not showing.
Only 2Ghz is appeared",3

Good but not meet our expectations,3
Gud for normal usage net browsing is little slow,3
Thanks amazon best for value for money,3
"Was disappointed with the range of the signal. not value for money, should have purchased one with lesser antenna",3
"Sound quality not expected level for this price rs.3000.mic is not clear. Not recommend to use more than 1 hrs,bcoz it's cover ur full hear sweating coming. Usb charging cable length low so u have to use mobile charge cable . I'm fully not satisfied very disappointed..I not recommend this product to buy this price .",3
"I received the Zebronics Web Thunder Headphones yesterday. I would like to inform that the product received was defective as the microphone was not working properly and even the battery have had some issues regarding charging of the product. So the Battery backup time was very low as expected. I would also like to add that looking at the product, it looked like it was a ""Refurbished"" product and not a clean & fresh one. So I request the Amazon team to replace the delivered Refurbished headphones with a clean & fresh piece of headphones. I could not find replace option so return it",3
"Battery is worst part of this phone.
At this price nothing much expected.
Too much lag or hanging freezing alote.
Just use it for calling and WhatsApp only.",3
Problem with signal the call will drop in middle of conversation,3
"This product no longer covers the range for Wi-fi as compared to it's previous version.
Also, no mention in the literature about firmware upgrade (if needed).

Pl help.",3
it is ok but ink refill kit want to buy,3
"Very uncomfortable to wear for long time due to no ventilation to ear causing sweating on ear while wearing it.

Blinking bright lights are too bright, change something more user-friendly

While at 20% battery low voice is not pleasing. Do some alternative for that. Alert users while battery is at 5%",3
"It was too difficult for us to manage with our busy schedule , a very difficult time for us to handle defective peace . Actually this mobile which we received got heated up since beginning while being charged this is not expected from Amazon I expect a quick and effective return.",3
"Its a beautiful watch with amazing screen. Pretty smooth touchscreen too.
But it stalled during first day of rxploring it while browsing through notifications.
Also it does not seem to support Indian languages. So most of my whatsapp messages cannot be read on the watch. (It just shows bunch of question marks for messages received in Indian scripts). This was a deal breaker for me. If there is a way to enable Indian scripts on this watch, I am all in to go for it.",3
Description is not matching with actual product. Description mentioned as IPS. Couldn't find any where mentioned as IPS in manual or product. I found as LCD monitor.,3
"Found it lacking punch. ""Its all without the bass, only treble""",3
Need to restart the router after 2 to 3 days. Internet gets disrupted. Works after restart,3
Very good camera but didn't received the sd card ☹️,3
"the product is overall good because I already use before the brand. but sad to say this time I found two defaults 1)the product found defect not working mode after delivery and get a replacement.
2) after getting a new one still found one of the speakers (out of five ) one is not working.
I will say its better to purchase from the shop instead of giving online particularly for the music system.
amazon & vendor to take care of this.",3
Initially it worked nicely for 15-20 days. Then it started giving problem because of some update. I had to contact the support team who gave us solution in some time which is still pending vfrom my side.,3
"Its overall a decent entry level wifi 6 router.

1. No wds functionality (alot of the cheaper routers have this )

2. It heats alot but haven’t seen any performance issues

3. Range is not great. Just 2-3% difference compared to an older 2 antenna router",3
"Doesnt last for long . Ink catridge problems , it will dry fast . Not soooo good",3
PRODUCT IS GOOD BUT LAN CABLE RECEIVED WITH ROUTER IS NOT IN GOOD CONDITION.,3
I buyed for my mom and the sound clarity is not gd please don't buy the product tried for return and it not showing the option,3
Adjusting it on ears is a bit problematic which makes it a bit uncomfortable to wear.,3
Product is good but refilling of ink is very coastly and there is one issue in coloured prints and that is lack of white colour printer use yellow colour insted of white in background and that spoils my experience,3
"Build quality of this router is very good.
But the problem is the wi fi signal are very poor.",3
"Getting started was more difficult than MI band 2 that I had earlier. Getting the band to charge was difficult. It came with less than 10 percent charge. While looks like a sturdier band (compared to band 2), taking out the device from band didn't seem intuitive. Seating the device to charging doc is what I found most difficult. It kept popping out. As per manual it just clicks in when pressed, but mine never clicked on. I spent quite some time to get it charged. Setup takes a long time too. Getting heartbeat tracking on band 2 was a simple button touch, but this one needs few more steps, involving scrolling and deeper menu. Additional features thus impact the basic fitness tracking related ease of use. Step tracking seems to be fairly accurate.",3
Good product. Value for money.,3
"Average product, think once again",3
"Mobile is good in price range, camera is excellent but MI remote is not working and the problem is really frustrating. Is there any solution please guide. Not able to operate my voltas AC with Mi remote.",3
"I'm only gonna tell the bad things so you know the rest is good/acceptable

1. Really Really uncomfortable and that's the main reason why I returned it, it wasn't much heavy but the clamping pressure was so much and the headphone doesn't have another way to adjust the pressure or distribute it evenly because it's a cheap headphone let's be honest, the clamping pressure was so much, my jaw started to hurt after few hours of use and it wasn't very pleasent and it wasn't very comfortable to say the least.
2. The ear cups are big but If have big ears, it's not gonna fit.
3. The sound quality is alright, you can use something like Voice Meter to increase or tweak the sound but at highish volume, the bass sounds literally like farts, yes, no bass, sounds like farts.
4. The ear cups are just not much, for this kind of design, it's not much.",3
It dont support flash,3
Look of the watch is really very cool. Battery life is totally amazing. Bad about this watch is that we cannot change the watch faces except this watch is totally perfect in this amount.,3
"It's ok watch at price tag. BP is not accurate. Other things are good. Mainly it has ecosystem of coaches, doctors, trainer on call who can guide you to meet your goals. New concept for many indian custimer...",3
"I can't give more than three star for this product.
Because the sound isn't very well for this much price.
But in charge it is best.",3
"Wrist sense is little bit slow,after we turn the wrist one sec late display will be on.",3
It has 3 antennas but still has same coverage.....,3
"working from home is so irritating if you continually facing an electricity outage. I bought routes to avoid power failure problems. I don't understand why the price of this product is so high. At the same price, we can buy UPS for computers.",3
"Range of this router is same as one O bought 3 years ago with one antenna of ₹ 800.
Also dual band is not that useful as the internet I am using is of 25 mbps and same can be attained on 2.5Ghz. So don't waste your money buying it for wider range.",3
First product was defective then i replaced it and got nice product i got the deleivery before the time,3
Cartage is not good and it's costly also for refurbishing.,3
fingerprint to be late open,3
"Over all very good.
Only 1 issue I found unacceptable is poor battery backup. Lasts no more than 2-3 hrs",3
Noie cancellation is not up to mark,3
"I ordered this printer for rs1,999 on 5th October 2016 and got it delivered on 12 October 2016.
I checked this model on the official website and other sites but didn't found this product. Anyway coming to the product, the print quality is superb but the printer itself wastes 4-5 colour prints in the name of testing. Overall 10-12 pages were printed (including colour and black & white). On the box it said 100 pages can be printed and when I contacted them, they said it was just a sample. Anyway for my price it was avg.",3
This product is good. The clarity and storage capacity also better for 6800 rupees,3
"In these earphones, a person sitting beside me can easily listen to the song i am hearing. Also it does not connects to my phone easily, I have to insert it tightly and twisting it because when I move my phone or earphone the sound comes from phone only not by earphone.",3
printer is work fine .but caritigge is so costly.,3
"Screen size is to small, display is not based on watch size.",3
"I couldnt find anything different or best in this mobile as maketing was done.Very dull screen, battery drains very fast. If you compare with Redmi , Redmi is smarter in all features then samsung.",3
"Sound quality is pretty good. Low's are crisp and high's are great until you max the volume where it starts to break in certain high pitched notes. Build is decent, very light and the mic placement is poor. The mic quality in on the other hand is decent and the multi function button has a good feel to it. All mentioned functions besides the triple press for previous track works. Bass is low but very good considering the fact that these are earphones. Sturdy connecters, good design and the inclusion of 3 sizes of eartips make this a good buy. Will recommend only if price is below ₹350.",3
The built quality is not so good you can get better product in this price range.,3
Not up to mark compared to real me and redmi note 9,3
Phone is better but. Camera quality is not better.,3
"Not as expected
Used for small rooms and getting huge sound when it reaches max volume",3
"Loud sound for voice call, sound quality not great for songs and music. Durable product. However the ear pieces are too huge and leads to pain with prolonged usage.

Not sure of the customer care number which gives me tension on the product warranty support",3
Below expectations!!!,3
"After 1 week, Subwoofer was not given bass.",3
"The router works best I feel in large homes rather than flats, as the divisions of wall do make the signal strength fall.
Else works fine.",3
"Best price money.. canon 1500D
Good picture👌",3

Testing cartridge low response and 15-20 prints.,3
"Works well with stats but friends feature doesn’t work, nudges don’t work . Rest work ok. Waiting for app update",3
Not for long Durability,3
"Product Built & Design is Overall good, Only problem with its accuracy even step count is not accurate, temperature display error, spO2 is more or less good , Heart rate measurement is ok. you cant rely on this as its not accurate as mentioned in product description & customers review. Battery is good to go for almost 6 days & depends how u use,Display is awesome at this price range. it really needs software improvement & please noted down its has only one service center located in Ghaziabad and their customer care really sucks.",3
"Not good as expected, one side earphone got damged and not getting sound from that speaker after some time",3
"The look and feel is fine, accuracy is too early for me to say as I have just purchased the band. Value for money is a definite YES though",3
"INSTALLATION IS QUICK. LOCAL SERVICE PERSON WAS HELPFUL.
PRINTER COULD NOT BE ATTACHED WITH WIFI.
I TRIED 3 TIMES TODAY ON 180018033366 THEY COULD NOT CONNECT TECHNICAL PERSON FOR ASSISTANCE. POOR HELPLINE SERVICES ONE HAVE TO KEEP WAITING A LONG TO CONNECT THE LINE AND AFTER WASTING 15 TO 20 MNTS NO HELP.
SHOULD IMPROVE THERE AFTER SALES SERVICES OTHERWISE NO USE OF PRODUCT. IF ONE DONT GET FULL USE OF PRODUCT THEN WHY ONE SHOULD PAY EXTRA AMOUNT FOR IT.",3
Not a great sound for this price. I expected better. I have another earphone in the same price segment with a different brand which is much better than this. This kind of quality is available in 200-300 INR easily. Don't waste your money buying this.,3
No baf,3
It worked well first few days. Then the range got dropped huge. Unexpected!!!!,3
"Very Good watch to purchase only the problem with this if you wear it daily, screen got scratched and look dirty but no more problem is there in watch everything is good",3
"The thing that I dislike about the product is that except the good features,it is not durable and it worked only for 1 month even after taking good care.please Take more care about this bcoz boats is the best company this market has to offer.",3
It's good but not best,3

"Read all the reviews but was still skeptical to buy a chinese product. After lot of research couldn't find a better alternative and bought this. It worked like a charm from Saturday till Wednesday and took its last breath on the eve of Wednesday. Suddenly there was no wifi in the house, router had no power light, no change after pressing power on button, reset, changing adaptor to different socket nothing worked. Finally i am placing a return request. Really wanted it to work and support me in this lockdown but it had other plans.
While it lasted, it gave me a good coverage and speed. I was getting around 144mbps on 5ghz in a different room and 149mbps on 2.4ghz close to the router on my 150mbps ACT plan.",3
Please any one suggest whether it works for act fibernet with 50 Mbps. Reply me to purchase this product for home,3

Gifted it to someone I really care about. It's is a good product but I expected more from it.,3
Perfect router for my home,3
"For the price I expected better. I am on calls all day long and so I bought these as an alternative to in ear buds so that I can change from time to time. Having buds stuck inside can be painful for hours. However I don't find these particularly comfortable either. They're a little heavy and tight (may be my head is slightly larger than average). And they do cause sweat. I briefly tested out the on ear phones (the lower price point) and found those more comfortable as they don't cup your ear and press your earlobes.

As for sound quality, audio is fine, nothing super. Noise canceling is average, like one of the reviewers here commented. Nothing out of the ordinary...

Amazon delivery was reliable so no issues there.

Overall, now that I've spent 10k buying it I have to use it!",3
Good phone for low level task user like old people but nothing is in the box no case or headphone only a charger is in the box,3
great,3

Not happy. The product shows made in china and there is no Made in India tag. Is this product genuine??,3
I am not satisfied with this product .Price is high and phone gat handed .Very poor quality,3
"So at the beginning when I got it it worked well and good, I was happy with the product.
Fast forward 3 months , the volume down button doesn't work anymore. The hinge which makes the pad go up and down became very loose.
4 months later I accidently dropped it from knee level , the main on switch completely broke, build quality is down the slope (it is cheap so that is there to consider )
And since main switch broke I have been using it on aux the entire team since.
Battery is the one thing which i find good about it, lasted around 2- 2 1/2 days using almost 7 -8 hours a day.
If you ask me , I feel it's worth it, for a cheap price I'm still able to use it with aux",3
NO WIFI EXTENDER OPTION.,3
Does not have Oxygen sensor,3
"Only disappointing thing is no brace/net cover/ rat protection for bass. It is located below the woofer cabinet pointing ground. Phillips can add a small screen on woofer for some basic info.
Bass and music outcome is great. A very good music system for a room.",3

Amazon India pls get this resolve quickly as am loosing my work due to no internet.",3
"Pros:
decent range, covers around 80 feet(through walls) and after intermittent drops.
Sharing etc.. have been reviewed by others.
Cons:
The major i can see is, you cannot load opensource firmware. for instance OpenWRT or DD-WRT cannot be loaded on to this because firmware locks the device from upgrading/changing the firmware. emailed TP-Link, i don't get any help about it.

Usually these hardware companies stop building software at some point, fix bugs at leisure, the best way to stay secured, get more features and have control of your device is through opensource software, hence, someone who's looking for a good hardware to load opensource firmware, this product is useless.",3
"GW2480 24-inch - Got it for just below INR 10K.
Overall it is just a average to good monitor for day-to-day usage. But nothing impressive.
Pros:
* All the usual functions work as expected
* Picture quality is good but one needs to set the brightness very high to get better picture quality.
* Although the bezels are thin, it looks sturdy.
* HDMI cable included in the pack. So, no need to buy that separately (like few other monitors in the market)
* Wall mounting
* Several preset picture modes
* Price-INR 10K
Cons:
* Slight darkening of the panel on both vertical sides near the edges when viewed exactly from middle on low brightness (around 40% or less). This is kind of typical LCD drawback of old days but didn't expect it from Benq brand. That too in 2021. But this goes away for higher brightness is set (of course, that will strain the eyes)
* Although there are several preset picture modes with respective brightness/contrast with bright display, most of the pre-defined ones are too bright for daily usage and one can't adjust the brightness and some other settings for these pre-defined modes.

Felt that my 10 year old Dell All-in-one 2310 had better display overall (although bit enhanced colour & colour/contrast calibration wasn't possible with it).

I was bit skeptical before buying and that skepticism was very valid I guess. As these companies churn out these monitors with less than INR 10K, I guess they are cutting some corners.",3
The product was good but after a month it stopped working not charging and no voice commands after turning on. Only blue light blinking and going off. It lasted only for two months. At the end one earpiece stopped working and even charging slot cover went out in a week. And worst after sales service from ptron. Customer care number rings and asks us to wait as all agents busy and auto disconnects and customer support email never responds. The ticket created through complaint port on website will be answered after a week or so. Some questions will never be answered they just copy paste the draft.,3
Does not support automatic Duplex(both side) printing. One needs to do it manually,3
Camera quality is not soo good.,3
Charging box is not working,3
I have been using it since 11 months. Print quality is great. No problem at all except print output is only limited as ink level is presently at 10% and till now only 1429 black/white Pages printed. So it is much less as compared to mentioned output of 4500 BW pages.,3
better but you can choose another phone to buy,3
"I am writing this review after using it for 4 months. Based on my experience initially, I had returned this thinking this as defective but second unit was same again.

What is good?
1. Sound is really very loud for playing indoor.
2. A good product at this price range.

What can be improved?
1. Bluetooth connectivity and connection strength. Signal drops and it feels you are streaming something with slow internet.
2. When power cuts, it by default resets to maximum volume.
3. Sound has distortion while playing at maximum volume.
4. Aux cable is just 1 meter.
5. Sound quality is better on BT than aux cable though it should be same.
6. Remote doesn't work even at the distance of 4-5 meter. You need to go very close to the speaker.

Should I buy this?
Yes, if you have budget constraints and can't invest additional 2-3K. Buying this product at 3K is not a bad deal.

Bottom line:
Add 2K more in your budget and go for another product for better sound experience.",3
"Good only. Sound is low, but balanced.

Cons:
Just above ordinary, with good design
Cord length is small
Cord tangle
Not justify brand name quality.",3
Just ok for home use....Not for office use ... It has so meny problems with its head ..... Required nozole cleaning regularly .... It has also peper jam problem....,3

"The amplitude of the sound is low. The boat earphones of the same price range gives you more loud sound for the same volume level. It's not bad considering its price, but it's not value for money to me considering Sennheiser gives you a much much better option at 700.",3
"Looks good. Doesn't has many functions which it should definitely consider and yeah you cannot return it. Overall if you are looking for a watch which can keep a track of your fitness routine,do not buy this.",3
"The features are ok i purchases it on dec 2019 today being 4 dec 2020,thought if giving a review though i just use this laptop for mails basically workpurpose so from my point of view there is lagg while starting / the mousepad alreading begin to freeze / the page flikkers ,i mean i do not use the laptop like a hardcore even just for office mails ,forget gaming or anything else just basic",3

Even if I restart the device every morning, I receive less internet speeds in few devices which are connected on the same network.",3
neither good nor bad . average,3
"The headphones are good. Quality is ok, not great. But at this pricepoint its acceptable. Value for money product. Just the balance between base and treble is not properly tuned. Should have a little less treble.",3

"Printer is good for home usage where u don't need to print daily or in bulk..its not for students wanting to printing study material, bcz it only prints 120 pages after that u need to refill cartridge..also since it's a basic printer, it's kinda slow.
Otherwise print quality is good and colours are great and vibrant",3
Hands free does not fit in ear and keeps falling. Otherwise design factor is good.,3
product is not upto quality,3
"Product looks good. Currently facing issues in temperature readings. Reading is totally wrong. It shows around 76.5 F.
GOQUI support is quite poor. Chat conversation on their app is not satisfactory. It's kind of artificial intelligence but no solution to address this issue. Actual talk with representative wasn't resulted in solution other than sharing pics in chat window. Which is resulting no where. Considering to replace or return if no solution is provided soon.",3
I have bought this earphones on August 12 th 2019. And it's not even 6 months the mic went off and the right earphone isn't working.Very disappointed with this. Well it was good in the starting the sound quality and all but durability is zero. It has a warranty of 1 year but not sure if I can claim anything 🙃,3
Quality of body is poor,3
not best,3
Audio quality is good not best normally used for calling battery backup is mentioned on box is 6 hours but it's less than 6 hours.,3
Accuracy doesn’t seems to be perfect,3
"This printer paper Jam, slow print.",3
Not happy with the watch faces. Device feels fragile.,3
Print is very high coasting,3
"Okay kind of earphones. Simple sound, nothing extraordinary. Not the kind of plug and play earphones that will give the required bass/punch/wow sound right out of the box, however has the potential to handle extra bass and Treble. Good Equaliser paired with this can give good results, Haven't experimented myself though. My need was calls and sparing casual music/gaming and it's serving the purpose. Doesn't seem very weak/strong. Durability remains to be seen. Ordered from Appario retail on 23rd Jan got on 25th in Mumbai. Update (28th May 2020) : Stopped working one fine day during Corona Lockdown without any apparent reason. Not reliable. Had bought Soundmagic E10C, months before this and is still going strong, though it is 5 times costlier than this.",3
Some of internal problems are there,3
Cartilage is very costly and minimum prints,3
"CD drive was not there
A great mishap",3
"Pros:
1. Speakers (Hardly any others have)
2. HDMI ports 2 (No other in this price segment)
3. A good screen and sturdy stand
4. Auto brightness adjustment sensor

Cons:
1. Useless VGA cable (after 2019 which laptop comes with VGA port??) HDMI cable is must.
I tried using type-c to VGA adaptor, monitor works but speakers do not work.
2. Not so great speakers (don't think of using it as TV)
3. Backlight bleed all over (typical IPS)
4. HDMI ports are very near, cannot put a cable and fireStick together (2 cables will work easily)

It could have been really handy if it had USB ports, but no !

I bought this on sale, costed me Rs. 6750, worth the money, I am going to keep this despite of cons but due to the pros. I would recommend buying if you are ok with these cons.",3

#small screen so easy to handle.
#overall 3.9star I'll give,coz you own samsung at such cost.
# may be bigger M01 is better.",3
Quality of speaker is really poor. Not at all happy with it.,3
Not as comfortable as expected,3
Not upto the mark,3
Touch is not working properly nd accuracy of watch is very slow. Watch glass is not quality no screen glass nd no screen cover on the watch.....,3
"Pros:
1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life.
2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.

Cons
1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.
2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling
3.The display is also not up to the mark

So my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with it
but if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.

Thank you
I hope you all will like my review",3
Made in china product,3
Adequate performance,3
One speaker not working time best,3
Nice watch sleep tracking is good and accuracy of this watch 80% I found problem in this watch when I was standing a same place for long time at that time watch was giving me the notifications stand up and do some exercise which was wrong examine & step counting also showes wrong many time and not calculating automatic workout activitis which is not good..,3

"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Good quality air buds.",3
It has network issue.many times the network does not work. I have checked all settings but not working properly.,3
"I bought these earphones because I bought them previously and loved them. They did everything they are supposed to do. Alas, I myself broke them so I ordered a new set. They came quickly enough but alas, the sound quality is terrible, scratchy and my own voice is unrecognisable. Possibly a defective product? Possibly previously 'used' as the plastic bag that covered the box was clearly torn & previously opened. Hopefully not a duplicate model. Product LOOKS & FEELS great, which is why I gave it 3 stars overall rating. I am now having them replaced with a new set. If the new set works properly, I'll update this review. They are supposed to arrive in a couple of days, so stand by.

Just received the free replacement, and the new ones are working normally, STILL not as good as my last pair, which were comparable to Apple EarPods, but serviceable. HOWEVER, the packaging is suspect: while Amazon's delivery pouch was fine, the manufacturer's packaging looked AGAIN as if it had been tampered with: the clear plastic cover was again torn and looked like it had been opened and re-closed; the box itself looked the same, and one end was already opened. Either the manufacturer is at fault or the dealer is selling knock-offs. But Amazon should kindly look into this.

I shall make a further addition to this review after I've used the headphones for a month.",3
"Average Quality Samsung M12. Camera is not good, Mobile processing very low but Battery is Fine. Samsung name wise not working. So very low quality mobile.",3
"1. Aligning watch straps is little hectic & time consuming.
2. Setting up watch is lengthy process.
3. Charging point is very difficult, unsure whether the watch is perfectly placed kn charging point or not.
4. Limited exercise option. One can’t use for Gym",3
I bought this product and within 15days blinking problem started but after repair it running good.,3
All the features are good but the build quality is poor thin wires which can easily break not long lasting,3
Useful product,3
Good one .but looks small and light weight ..not suitable for multi connection,3
"Pros:
1.) The watch is sleek, lightweight and good looking.
2.) takes less time to charge, charging dock is easy to connect.
3.) Heart Rate sensor is pretty accurate, almost equivalent to professional one.

Cons:
1.) Spo2 sensor is a hoax in this one. Its more of hit and trial process and 90 % of time either gives you faulty reading or filed measurement status.
2.)Its poorest aspect is that during running, even watch is connected to phone every time via bluetooth, it always fail to sync with GPS. Wither you have ""No GPS"" or faulty/misleading data. My old Mi3 band still performs better than this one.
3.) Battery life is not so great, as advertised.

Summary: Needs lot of improvements.",3
Ear's hurt while using this product.,3
"Build and Battery quality is as well as they said. Lack of watch face you can face.
But realy buddy, it disconnects like butter...",3
Although its one of the higher priced D-Link product the wifi rage is just ok. The wifi range is little better than modem you get from the broadband service provider.,3
"Product is okay!
Disappointment is they are pressuring you to give them ratings and review to get warrenty",3
Can buy but compare with other option before got for it,3
"I was an apple earphones user and needed something budget friendly. So thought of buying infinity and came here after youtube reviews.

The sound quality is good. But it is not enough. When in high pitches, these don't let the dialog or vocal to dominate. So you would end up increase the volume which is bad for your ears.

Normal sounds it works perfectly. Call quality is good. Noise cancelation is okay for the price.

Bass quality is good but not as others mentioned. You can feel the bass but won't be satisfied if you are bass lover.

Sound quality is good if u can live with first point.
Budget earphone which does its job.

The reason for giving 3 star is, boat 225 sounds better than this. Multiple songs compared and also action sequences. Boat performs better, but it was heavy. JBL is lite but comes with these limitations.

So choose well. It's not bad at all but it's a choice you have to make.",3
Used and teared item is delivered. Loosing trust on Amazon. Din't the pockeger know that a used product is delivering to valuable customer.,3
Camera is not good,3
Good but slooooowww,3
"Just i used for 4 months right side earphone not wrkng, we r preffering branded headset because good qiality and long lasting.if The company providing such products means definetly automaticallyit will loose its brand. I will definitely tell 2 my frnds not 2 buy jbl ear phns anymore",3

"Battery and camera is very average and it's lot of hanging while playing games, battery backup is very poor",3
"Initially worked fine, but not a well finished product.
The filter of one side of earphone was not stuck properly.

After another 1 month right side of earphone stopped working, only left side working.

Overall not a good choice as reliable produce with longevity.",3
The only problem found is with the microphone. It is found way below. We have to hold or keep it near our face while talking. Even a slight change in it's position makes it difficult to hear properly,3

Ok good,3
"My one camera stopped working properly inspite of doing reset multiple times. It has warranty of 1 year, how to get the exchange",3
"It's an ok-ok router.
Those 5 huge antennas are just for namesake, it has 3 antennas for 2.4 Ghz but it was not at all beating my old dlink dir 615 which has only 2 antennas for 2.4 Ghz both were covering almost same area of my house. The portion which dlink was not able to cover this tplink archer c60 was also not able cover either.
It's not at all a gigabit router so don't get trapped by those advetised speeds of 867 Mbps + 450Mbps, they are just data transmission speed over the wireless on 5 Ghz and 2.4 Ghz respectively. If your internet connection is of more than 100 Mbps, this router will simply not support that.",3
Good 1.Very nice further in the device,3
"The quality of the product is very average but for this price its ok.. After the use of 1 day.. It one side of the product stopped working, it kinda gave me a shock but after some time it was normal.. I been a boat customer of past 3 yrs and this is my tip for u incase u r purchasing...

Not very useful... Mobile apps do the same jobs,3
Not sure if this is a good and hardy product that JBL is famous for because the left side stopped working for sometime and then started working again. Not sure if there will be stable performance in this one. disappointing!,3

"The AX1500 is no slouch by any means. The difference in network performance was night and day compared to my old Archer C5.

However, as I own two RE305s already, I was planning to make a OneMesh network and was looking for a supported router.

When I was reading the Q&A section for AX1500 (AX10), a user's review and answers about AX1800 (AX20) showed up and I was mislead to believe that the AX10 supported OneMesh functionality.

Disappointed that I couldn't end up creating a smooth seamless wifi network for my home due to this ambiguous Q&A section.",3
"The sound has brilliant treble and clarity is amazing. Ideal for making calls.
Biggest con is the bass quality. The bass is simply not there which can be a deal breaker if you are buying for listening to music.
Overall an OK product for the price.",3

"Overall a good product for a sub 800 over the ear headphone with mic and FM. Faced difficulty in playing FM. The signal reception varied from 0 to 80% when you turn your head in various directions.
Quality of sound is good considering the price range.
Bluetooth is good and it pairs fast. Received phone calls, clarity was moderate.",3
Nice product....,3
"Exorbitantly priced but has served the purpose in the last 24 hours. Had to go for this only because traditional PC UPS were not getting delivered to my location. UPS is cheaper than this and can support laptop as well. So go for it if you can get it.

I am surprised to see that the date of manufacture of this product on its box says July 2020. How did I even receive it in June 2020 then? That is a trust buster. I only hope that the product performs as expected and has a long life.",3
"The print quality is great & it's very easy to use and also install. But unfortunately, the no.of pages printed are not as mentioned in the product description i.e., ~480 pages (Black & White), 150 pages (Colour) - ISO standards this is a great disappointment for me. Other than that rest all is great.

Is there any way to reduce the color percentage on the printer (HP DeskJet 3835)?",3
"The printer is working perfectly fine and the quality of the print is really awesome the only drawback of this printer is the cost of the cartridge. The combo of HP 803 costs around Rs 1500 which is half the price of the printer itself. Moreover, the cartridge does not last long for 100 pages the maximum pages which can be printed with a single cartridge is 20 pages.

I would recommend not to buy this product unless and until you wanna spend your hard-earned money lavishly.",3
"The monitor is very nice overall with a matte finish and 3 side narrow bezel. Excellent product if you want to mount 2 next to each other.

I upgraded from an old LG monitor which was VESA mounted to the wall and was hoping put this in instead, first it did not come with the screws and the ones from the old monitor would not work (too long) and second you need to leave about 3 inches between the back of the monitor and the wall (so only a swivel type VESA stand will work).

Second problem is the handling of low resolution video (480p) and below. My earlier 19 inch monitor would handle 480p video quite well and the same looks extremely grainy on this 22 inch monitor. Don't know what is causing this but since I only changed the monitors and nothing else, I assume it is the monitor.",3
"Product is up to the mark, not bad, accuracy is not up to the mark rest all are good.",3
Very nice all of this,3

I thought it would be a gem buy for me. But it is a pain buy for me. My ears starting to pain after few minutes of usage.,3
It's a good product but there is some problem with accuracy and does show right sleep time and even show please do some activity even after I take a walk for some meters. Cannot determine if I'm sleeping or awake.,3
I wholly like the product but I found that the one I received is not able to function properly with play and pause button. This disappointed me and the next thing is that the phone no. Provided to claim the warranty upon is said to be invalid or the services busy when it is called.,3
Wifi range is small,3
Performs well,3
"Person will not be comfortably wear headset more than 30 mins. It will create pain in Ear area.

Good but catrideges finish fast,3
"Battery life is good. Touch screen is average. Heart rate and footstep calculation is good.

Worst is sleep monitoring.

If compared, honor band was far better.",3
This is a average phone.,3

"Not worth spending on 5GHz Dual Band Router if you expect 5GHz over a two stories building. I hoped that the 5GH would travel atleast two floors but it works only when sitting very close proximity to it.

I would have not ordered this one had I known that the 5GHz is not strong over a distance. Would have stick to my 2.5GHz N Router.",3

"Deco X60
Here are my thoughts after 6 months of using this mesh system:

Pros:
1. Minimal and clean design looks really good
2. Setting up is a breeze with the deco app
3. Reliable wifi for stationary devices ( tv, desktop pc, ip cams)

Cons:
1. Mesh performance is not satisfactory. When I move from one room to another, many a times I have to turn my wifi off and then on again so that it latches to the nearest node. At first I thought this is a mobile phone issue, but checked it with 5 diff phones, the problem persists. Defeats the sole purpose of buying such an expensive system

2. If you connect the nodes wirelessly , the speed drop is significant. For optimum speed, you need to connect via an ethernet cable, which again is a hassle.

3. Only 2 lan/ wan ports per unit. Now if you have a large no. of wifi devices at your place like me, you would want to connect some of them through wire for better and reliable connection (also it helps minimize some bit of interference). You need to buy a switch to extend the ports then, which creates a mess of wires around the place. Not like it at all

4. The units have a circular ring like opening on top which I didn't notice earlier. I understand it is for heat dissipation but it also means that dust (and dog hair if you have one at your place) gets into it which could be an issue.

5. At approx 35K for a pack of 4, it's really expensive and not good value for money.",3
It's been only 5 months and both sides of the headphones not working and the customer care is not picking up. And even the website never loads up. VERY DISSAPPOINTED.,3
Getting a coverage of 2 Antenna product. Dont know what to do. Got TP-Link trusting the brand name. What to do?,3

"Was sent a used MI band 4 packed in MI band 5 box which was really surprising but the return and replacement process was smooth.

The replacement was nice and happy with the product. Screen quality and features sets are excellent. Battery life is good even with heavy usage. MI app needs a little time getting used to. The band is pretty comfortable to wear all day long",3
I have been using boat from long time.. this is my 3rd wired earphone.. and I have bluetooth head set as well. But what I observed in all the earphones common is they will work for not morethan 6 or 8 months..but sound quality everything is good.. but durability is not more than 6 or 8 months,3

It can be connected to computer, laptop, tv and can be played by mobile via bluetooth. it has wired antenna given at the back. Remote is provided with it. It really a good complete speaker. The major.. major drawback according to me is whenever you increase the volume the bass automatically goes up and vice versa. Every single time you will have to decrease or increase the bass as soon as you adjust the volume which is very very annoying atleast to me.",3
"I have both mi band 5 and honor band 5. The interface and looks of honor is much better than mi. Also it cost few hundred bucks less.

If you are on budget and looking for a monitor, go with this one. Its definitely worth it",3
Stand design is beautiful rather than stable. Stability part of design need more concentration.,3

Thanks",3
Sound quality is fine. Can't hear music on full volume because distortion happens. Anyways full volume is too loud so it's fine to hear on lower volume. Bass is not upto the level where other headphones have. So it is an average deal,3
Sound quality not good and item damage,3
I liked the printer so much but it's ink gets low very early,3
"The wire connecting the headphone to the instrument is quite flimsy, came apart in less that a fortnight. We have bought a new one. Having some difficulty in bluetooth connection also, hoping to resolve it soon. Otherwise, good headphones.",3

Liked the sound but quality is not good enough mine got broken after a few month,3

"Amazon did a great job delivering product much earlier than expected, however would like to share my experience about this product based upon couple of days of use....

Pros:
1)Speakers small in size, yet deliver powerful sound.
2)Multiple features like Bluetooth, USB, FM radio, Aux in, remote control, etc.
3)Previous Volume level is maintained upon next power on.
4)Good looks.
5)All these comes at comparatively cheaper price.

Cons:
1)Too much bass, irritation if you listen for a longer time. This may be due to bass reflex type of speakers.
2) Satellite speakers seems to be a bit smaller in comparison with the power generated by amplifiers.
3)No equilizer in Radio, Bluetooth, Aux mode. Only bass control available. Equilizer works only in USB and SD card mode.",3
Some issue with OS optimization. Phone restart when using some apps like telegram. May be due to 1GB ram also this issue May be after update it will work well,3
"It's all relative. If you compare the bass with CX-180 (~Rs 700-800), the bass is not that good. I bought these just coz the name was Bassheads. If you really enjoy music and could afford more get the CX180. The bass and overall sound quality is amazing in those. For the same budget as these earphones, I think the bass is decent but can't be too sure because haven't tried other products in this price range.",3
"This product is uses last 10 days, it doesn't properly work, when I lift hand sometime it doesn't sens. And doesn't show time.",3

The plastic looks very cheap.

pros... you can clone all the apps & not just selective few.. the camera is not so bad yet.. the battery backup is ok & the screen resolution is better..",3

"You get what you pay for... For this price range (under 500) these earphones seems to be a good pick. Connected with laptop for office calls and these are working well. Though there is no noise cancellation so if your app from which you are taking calls don't have noise cancellation, these earphones will not be a good choice. Quality of wires are a bit thin and looks delicate, though neckband is ok. Bass is also ok if you have not used a good quality earphones earlier :) if you had, you will find this bass flat.

The reasone I gave 3stars because of a issue i am facing. In tikona, we have to login to use Internet. But when i turn on router, it doesn't connect and when i reboot the router then it gives the option to login. So everytime, i have to use Internet, i will have to reboot it.
Except this, it's very good.",3
"It got so many bugs, the screen turned completely blank when i clicked on 'update system app', surprisingly NO heating issues, brightness is low
For camera the rear is okay but front lacks details",3
Product was good but i was expected more signal strength by two antenas but it not as i expected,3

"Hey
Highly recommend if you are a Buddha or buddhi but if you are young go for any 3gb ram phone instead of this as it doesn’t look premium where as other phone have that looks
But if you have to do heavy work ya it can do that but only thing the camera quality is really bad one",3
"I set it up first and it was great. Very useful for work as I could see a lot more of my Excel sheets and didn't need to scroll often.
But then I noticed a small internal scratch on the right side of the screen, in the middle. Smaller than my thumbnail. So then I looked for other faults and found a dead pixel.
These were not acceptable to me hence I returned it. Return was seamless, got my refund within a few hours of product pickup.",3
In specifications it is mentioned as 1 gigabit wan and lan ports. But its is not supporting more than 100mbps on LAN ports. I'm the support only on wireless with 5 GHz. Event I'm not seeing more than 100mbps speed on 2.4 GHz.,3
Not expected result as they say 1 week battery life but 4 to 5 battery become low,3

 Hii Everyone...
I received this phone in a brand new condition.Everything was fine but there is a technical issue in the software or might be in display....When i used this phone on the very first day i did not notice this error.But next day i saw this fault.The display of the phone was getting hang sometimes...Pixels was bursting also...And there were some glitches on the display when i was using it.So i returned this phone. You may also see the pictures and video which i attached here.

It might be a technical error.Otherwise Packaging was good.I received this product too early.It was not a seller's fault.Amazon also refunded the total amount.Thank you Amazon.",3
It was unboxed,3
Phone is hanging,3
Limited working condition - Three months down the line sound output is only from one side. The jack has to be adjusted and held in one position to be able to hear from both sides. The moment we release the jack it goes back to square one. Not satisfied.,3
"ok but not good..... bad quality of plasitc,,,,",3
When it says bass heads do take this literally that the bass will over power all other instruments. So ppl who like listening to soft or more of acoustic instrument might not like the experience. It's an amazing headphone if you like EDM or heavy bass music specially for workouts or house parties.,3
Good product for normal usage,3
Its headrest is not good,3
"1) The angular movements of the ear pieces are restricted.
2) It doesn't become completely flat.
3) It doesn't curve alonwith your head's curvature but just touches the top of your head like a bow (instead of a semicircle). It has a very different and rather awkward fit. A much cheaper boat Rockerz 560 is much more comfortable than this one.",3
Takes 3-4 hrs to fully charge and battery drains fast. Touch screen is confusing.,3
remote is not working properly,3
"Mobile App is good. Band looks very stylish. Some of the new features like colour screen, custom wallpaper are great.

I face problem with the accuracy. For same daily workout, sometimes it shows 10-20 calories burnt, sometime it shows more than 100 calaries burnt. Also charger provided does not fit properly with the band",3
"These are about average headphones. The build quality is ok.
I did not quite measure the battery backup time, but it usually lasts me for a couple of days with intermittent use for music and youtube videos.
The headphones work well with the aux cable.
There is a distinct lag when watching videos with the headphones in Bluetooth mode.
The sound is clear and balanced. Bass is not heavily boosted.
The microphone is not quite effective for calls. The people who I spoke to on phone, using these headphones, gave feedback that my voice was very low and with some distortion.
The earmuffs are ok, but I would have preferred them to be a bit larger. They did not cover my ears completely, so I found the earphones somewhat uncomfortable after an hour and half of continuous use.",3
It is a nice product but it cannot be used for gaming,3
The button near mic area only functions for receiving calls and not disconnecting them. I have to touch phone to disconnect calls. It is so annoying,3
For a budget headphone this is good but vocal quality is not good as bass quality and build quality seems fine to me till now but i am worried because it breaks easily .,3
Response time is very high.4to 5sec delay in displaying time. Step and km is less than the actual.,3
Very bad results & performance and charging is not take properly,3
"Yes phone getting lagging and slow, camera is good",3
Battery life is poor camera is okk fingerprint okk and fast charger take 2:50hours too full charge,3
Worst watch it won't show you calls msgs notifications it's only or sports it's shows how much steps you walk running dats it but you go for redmi watch same features they have in less price.,3
"Got it at Rs 1500.
The headphone is great at the sound, noise cancellation and bass.
But the problem is that it is too fragile.
It got cracked from opening / sliding side.
Don't go for it. Instead, try 510 etc. Because it will be unusable when cracked a little.",3
Very good quality...,3
Very nice Colour,3
"Camera quality not to uplevel mark,phone weight too much ,",3
need to improve packaging. sound quality is good but mic input is not much good,3
Can be better go for realme 7 in this price because of processor or can go for realme 8 or realme 8 5g,3
"I returned the product as it was not looking good on me. It's user-dependent.
It provided most of the required features like sleep tracking, touch screen, heart rate monitoring and notifications. The SpO2 feature was commendable. The design and its look and feel were good.
Easy to configure and use.",3
WiFi Range is low,3
"not smothness but quality is good
camera 3 point
scrolling is not good
touch responce not goos bot ok",3
"Given 3 stars overall just because of the plastic at the back, during the call it vibrates cheap plastic casing otherwise phone works fine. Other phones cheaper than this have better casing but then....",3
"The build quality ia good and vocals sound good but the main selling point which is bass as they mention super extra bass is not there , the bass is ok not that extra and at full volume , the vocals will hurt your ears and the bass will be same as in 75-80 percent volume. So , if your primary objective is bass as it was mine , so I won't suggest. Well, I have requested for return.",3
"Expecting 5G mobile phone by Redmi in June this year, I thought that spending money now would ultimately result in wastage of money if I have to exchange later or sooner with forthcoming 5G mobile. Hence postponment.",3

Camera is worst ...,3

Battery is good
Processor is decent slow sometimes",3

Cons:- Base is average and Bluetooth range is not too long,3
"Just bought it today
..let's see",3
"Okay this is pretty basic model of the boat i guess.
I ve been using this for 2 months now,didnt find any prob.
Actually this earphone focuses more on treble rather than bass which made it pretty basic.
Noise canceling is poor ! Not at all good !
Mic is okayish ! Can be used for petty basic purposes!
The reason why i took this is because of their service and product quality.

In my case..im okayish with this still they could have made the noise canceling more better and also the bass.",3
Xerox is good hard to install with a phone never works,3
The mobile is overheating while using video player like youtube by using 4g network.,3
Build quality not so good...... little weak body..... average sound quality..... good noise cancellation.........overall average......but ....just ok,3
I think you want by Canon DSLR Combo because the lense of the DSLR is very expensive but in Combo it will be affordable because this is an a basic lense which have lots of things are missing so I hope my review is help you to buy a right things,3
"Nice sound quality, looks stylish and quite durable. That's what you expect from a sony product.",3
Excellent product,3
"The only good thing about this is Price, but has OVERBOOSTED TREBLE, bass ZERO ( it has bass but very less.) Not at all good for EDM lovers nor for classical not the crystal clear voice.
Unsatisfied.
One should check it once from someone then purchase it.",3
"Overall This Mobile is good.
1. Bad Camera quality. Selfie camera is good.
2. Good battery life
3. Slow Mobile
4. Back side cover quality is not good
5. Better to have good quality pouch
It is suitable For normal usage people",3
"This product is very good , in speed and stability and it doesn't heats at all which is a good thing but the only problem i faced is the the signal reception , i mean i live in a 3bhk flat with 2 floors , i kept the router in 2nd floor so i get very good speed in 2nd floor but whenever i try in 1st floor , it looses reception very much .",3

"has to be pushed in tight with my samsung phone, to work, microphone a little difficult for the other person to hear
tried it on my laptop, you have to insert it partially and hold it in place",3

"Fingerprint good bt camera 📸 click photo is not work
Battery life is poor when using net...
Camera 📸 it's ok when using in day while using night its worst",3
"Hi,

Pros:
1. Installation is easy and happened within a minute.
2. Router looks are good.
3. The antennas are huge.
4. The processing power is great.
5. With 3 bands you can distribute your load easily and also give priority accordingly.

Cons:
1. No LED's on the side showing status. If you have kept the router at a height of 5 feet you wont be able to see any indications etc.
2. In spite of the huge antennas (6) the range is very low. It does not even cover my 1100 sq. ft flat.
The range is same as my 10 year old router.
Cannot penetrate multiple walls (not even 2).
3. Did not find any settings to boost the signal.
4. Too costly.

Overall not happy after spending 20K. Expected much better performance than I am getting.

TPLink please help to fix it or I may have to return the router and buy a cheap one which will perform the same.",3
This earphone does not cover every type of sound to play as the sound start cracking when certain rock songs are played which makes the quality of music very bad and mic is also little lower which makes the person to caught the mic in one hand and talk not satisfactory product from boat and this is my first bad experience from boat as i always use to buy only boat headphones and earphones.....hope this would mistake would not be repeated from such a reputed company,3
Band box is damaged from one side and there is no warranty card inside it it's like open from one side,3
Audio quality is very poor,3
"This product quality and function are okay, but the cartridge usage to print is not at good, I would say its worst.

I ordered two time since I bought this printer and it could only print on close to 70-80 Page including both color and Black & white. So you can imagine the cost per page.",3
Good product but could be better in the price range.,3
Cartage type printer is not sweetable for home use,3
Worst signal. Go for Archer A6.,3
"Woofer box is very large and shape is also odd, thia make it difficult to fit in a corner and lookas odd one out.
Soumd is ok not what you expect.
This is made in china to plastic quality is also not so good.",3
Call sound is very low,3
Cemera clarity is not clear and incoming sound system also very low.,3
"Compared to the Mi Band 3, the Mi Band 4 can accurately track when you are getting up in the middle of the night but will sometimes record you as asleep when you are lying in bed unable to sleep. I have been using other apps in conjunction with the Mi App with the band and the sleep tracking records are very different and I suspect inaccurate in Mi app which always shows almost little to no deep sleep and deep sleep just before I wake up. Other functions are great through.",3
"The product itself is quite nice, it provides uninterrupted power to Wifi router/modem but the installation instructions are not great. It took me one week of charging for the product to actually begin working. Now after 6-7 months it seems to have conked off. I've written to customer care today, if they are able to sort out the issue the product was completely worth it, else just a waste of money for a product that lasts a few months. I'll update this in case they respond.",3
"No noise cancellation, sound is better than usual
Bas quality is ok",3
Camera wise very good. BATTERY and finger sensor not working as expected or shown the specs,3
Battery life is one of the worst .. anyways there are multiple modes to set it right when not in use .. rest of all the things go perfect .. if you can charge once a day it will be a good product to take,3
"Pros
- Google Assistant - admittedly, the best thing about this watch. bought it for this reason. Google assistant will only work when your PHONE is connected to WiFi, so please note that.
- Feature-Rich(ish) - Watch capabilities are up there, you can do a lot with it. Tinkered around with a lot of settings, accessibility settings are good and work too.
- Looks sleek

Cons
- Doesn't stay paired with iPhones - really. Had to re pair the damn thing every two hours, which leaves you at a disadvantage. This is the sole reason/purpose that I have returned my product. Waste of money (and time) for me.
- Some watchfaces are really out there and make it hard to read the time. What the damn were they thinking? That's the priority for a watch. But okay, the regular watchfaces make it easy to do that, but the collaborations they made for watchfaces really didn't turn out very well.
- Google Assistant (yes, both a pro and a con) - Sadly assistant would misinterpret voice commands. maybe that is saying more for the mic than google assistant, you decide.
- Doesn't reflect events made in calendar, notifications amiss (iPhone) and scheduled alarms don't really go off all the time (?) which I don't understand

Hope this helps. Solid watch, but I believe it will work best with Android/Google Phones.",3
"In my house most appliances are of Samsung, I felt all devices are durable and heavy duty, therefore I looked for Samsung device in Phone and I feel Samsung devices are good one and real full criteria available in this as in phone I feel saw all parts are very good like camera, HD + picture quality, battery, charging speed, discharging speed except one that Samsung operating system gives useless applications only.",3
With 4 months of use can't comment on material durability.....Sound quality is good (considering what u can expect at such a cost),3
Got this product.. Best sound.. Bt I observed that getting Heat after 5-10 mins. Please resolve this issue or replace this item.,3
"It's range is low, across a wall its not able to connect to smartphone. It shows connectivity problem .",3
Product is good and awesome. Range is good then other wifi router.but the delivery services by fedex were not good.,3
Nice output,3
"Item is good but not complete package display cable missing, also the angle view is not good not movable, not recommended for new user. Plz don't buy this.",3
"So far this is working well, using since couple of months, installation is easy, just plug and use and don't any difference when power goes, I tested for almost 1 hr 30 mins and worked for me. This works only for router , not for laptop power back though.",3
selfie camera kharab hai,3
"Front camera very bad
Others all things are saisfactory.",3
"Sound music Quality is below average.But the price is rs 599/- and u are getting a brand product.(1 yr warranty)
Bass is zero in this headphone.
This Bluetooth device is only good for Talking for hours. The mic quality is Good . U will get good and clear voice of the other caller ,vice-versa.

Don't Compare it with Real me or Mi or Oppo or Oneplus.those cost pretty more approx 2k and gives u a good quality all rounder product.

If u dont have money or in very tight budget. or u are a just casual user of android(listen music for 2 hours or talk for 3 hours) .Then this product is for u.

U will not regret.trust me this is my thoughts.",3
"The white colour of the earphones looks really good. However, since the earphones market is innovating at such a fast rate, I believe there are better options at comparative cheaer pricea than this. Sond quantity is decent but for this price, better quality is expected",3
Battery backup is pathetic. Only for 3 to 4 days max. Dissatisfied from this watch,3
"Time delay in Delivery..Product Quality 5/5 star
Product Delivery 2/5 Star very disappointment,",3
"Speed improved as my old wifi was outdated

However the range isnt really great

Coverage for max 700-800 sqft only",3
If u ride a bike and want to use this product dont go for it it break up the musoc while riding or driving.. but it has good sound if u need ot for home only,3
I am not getting a good range of coverage single is also poor. Not a very good experience as reviewed by others.,3
Nice 🙂 phone,3
"I only loved the battery of this smartphone, which is quite big as compared to other budget smartphones.",3
Amazing,3
"Sound quality is good but the bass is average,,music is clear but lacks bass , everytime you hear music you would like to increase the volume though the volume is in maximum level",3
"BUT...>>>>>
Let’s know about its DURABILITY according to me when using this daily with care. So according to me this product is not durable at all in terms of its poor quality rubber material based CABLE which usually always tends to get tangled and wears out really fast when kept in a bag or a pouch and hence as time goes by it leads to affecting its performance in many ways in the long run and so my review is based on one of the major issues that i faced and so this is how it started..........
So first of all AMAZON is not at all blamed for the fault of this product as they packaged it well and delivered it on time before the expected delivery date and i am completely satisfied with AMAZON & it’s SERVICES!!!!!
And so it’s the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!

Anyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!!
So I will put an update as soon as I’m done solving my issue!!!!!

FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/-
THEN!!!!!
AND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT’S A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!!
BUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :)

AND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.

SO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.in
AS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!

Thanks to all of you who read and understand my review.
And finally please do comment if you want to do so and if you find this review helpful please hit or click that “Helpful”.",3
It's good but there is no noise cancellation as such.... And the rest pass are not good... It keeps talking of from my ears,3
"Actual prodect design is different than product image shown in images.
Why design is different than shown in product description?
Signal strength is very poor even in 1BHK flat around 450 sq ft.",3
"Guys trust me this is damn good if you just wanna increase your speed or make it stable. Mine was 40-50mbps without the router;.. after getting it installed, it gave me 70mbps(fixed with less than 1 fluctuation). The only reason why I have given this product 3 stars is that, it will not at all support your devices for even 1 floor away from the place of its placement. Other than that, it is too good in every aspects!",3
Wot I dint like is it’s written it includes usb cables but I cud not find any ... ders only d charger and d laptop and d Oder things are missing .,3
"Worst printer, scanning quality is very poor",3
No pin WPS is not working. Can't connect to the printer,3
Sound quality is good and battery backup is good,3
"WiFi signal and WiFi range not good, Not satisfied 😭",3
"I like everything about this headphone except it can't be used for calling because of it's mic quality and not good for base lovers. Unfortunately I've returned it. I've purchased it in 699 rupees only. If you're willing to buy it, wait for the deal.",3
Hang a lot,3
It was very easy to setup and go . Speed and connections stable and good. But it suddenly stopped working after 5 days and it won’t turn on so had to return !,3
It's very useful for home purposes,3
"USB cable, SIM eject tool, warranty card were not contained in my box.",3
Not fully functional on device,3
Rated it 3 stars since i was disappointed to see 'Made in China'. Working fine since last few days.,3

Please increase your budget and go for higher range....
Thank you.....",3
Glucometer Lancets.Fulfill the purpose. Quality of the plastic body is not that good.,3
Too messy when the printer prompts alignment issue.The initial ink is too low for continuous quality printouts. Got less than 12 A4 size printouts. After that the red color started fading. Had to order for a new color cartridge the same day I received the printer.,3
"Watch looks good. Since it is light weight looks delicate. Necessary features are available at this price range. Happy with this.
I tested with alarm. Alarm is firing after some minutes than scheduled time.
New issue with calls: calls will be notified after we lift the call. Sleep tracking is bad. I requested for return.",3
"Had issues with Fan Noise , However PC little slow need Ram upgrade to 8 GB",3
Base not high,3
The sound quality is disappointing. There are other headphones for similar price which offer a better listening experience.,3
No fingerprint available at all. Speed is little slow and camera is also not so good. But price is good.,3
Wish it had an option to pick up calls without having to look for the phone. Also should have liked if it had built in memory and playback option for songs. Many cheaper trackers have this functionality,3
"Don't expect more, no extra option only basic functions",3
"Never expected such a delivery by amazon worst...
Product is good suggestible but cost may seem bit high.. Quality of belt is not good at this cost
accuracy has been improved .. U can buy.. If it works good for 2 year, amount is payable ( paisa vasul)",3
All over good product,3
"This is my first DSLR. I will mention few points below which i liked and sumthing i didnt liked.
LIKED:
1) Its good for day time photography
2) its lightweight
3) Its good for normal photography
4) 55 - 250mm lens very good for bokey effect

DISLIKED:
1) Kit lens not so good
2) Flash too bright
3) Night time photo not good.
4) Quality feels average
5) photo quality average",3
Camera quality of front very poor,3
Looks wise we cant feel stylish bcoz it is smrtband light weight even not feel heavy...accuracy ok ok bluetooth conectivity and display user interface are realy great..dnt go heartmonitor verypoor stepscounting while driving..while walking it shows correct 80percent...idle alerts not performing good they can do it wel by update..finaly magnetic charging is good...,3
"Purchased Archer A7.
PROS: Speed has improvedand easy to install.
CONS: 5 ghz signal can cover only 2 rooms. Moment it encounters a wall the strength reduces to Allmost 50% and first floor signal doesn't reach.
If 5 ghz signal is weak your device automatically switches to 2.4 ghz. Eg first floor. But the 2.4 ghz signal does not have strong throw compared to single band router.",3
Fairly ok product. Range is nothing great,3
"Good deal atleast in lockdown period where no stationary shops or cybers are open.
Could have been perfect score but cost for refill is on higher end.",3
everything else is good but the built quality is way too cheap for a product this expensive.,3
Only Good,3
"Three Stars.Overall good. However i wasted 5 strips as machine was not showing the reading. You have to insert strip bit deep which one doesnt get to know till waste of some strips.

Shows result within 5 sec and with very less blood.",3
"Quality of product is low got replacement 2 times within couple of year.. Sounds is decent..

Noice cancellation is low",3
"Comfortable and lightweight earphones with well balanced sound. Build quality is okay.
JBL should offer a tangle free or braided cable, even cheaper earphones have braided or tangle free cables.
Deducted 1 star for regular cable and damaged ""Ear Tips"" ( got a pair of good quality ear tips from a small local shop ).

I would still recommend it ( if your budget is under 700 rs ), the sound quality is better than the competition.

Reviewing after using for about a year, still working as expected. Build quality is good, if you can overlook the outdated wire 🙂",3
Its get Stop working from one side..after 5-6th months🙊 if we neglected this fact then good sound quality n light weight...,3
Very very bad camera quality.,3
i dont why sellers took 8 days for shipping. what he was doing (preparing for refurbished?) i didnt get free basic transparent pouch in side the box. he is too late to ship the product. Apario pvt ltd,3

Ok ok kind of headphones. Expected better,3
i have recently bought this phone..on 18 may 2020.. delivery is good but there was no headphones in a box.features r awesome nd phone is working gud.but camera quality is bit bad.,3
Cartridge is very costly,3
"After using this mobile for 2 months I would say its an ordinary mobile for adults who are average users.
As i said its an average mobile, good call clarity and user interface.

Overall mobile is quite slow (you wont feel like its 4G RAM) even the contact search will take few seconds.
Camera is below average 48 mega pixel is not upto the mark (I have used 48 mega pixek redmi note 7 pro) video clarity is very bad, selfie camera is the worst.
Macro lens is not clear.
Irrespective of the apps you use it will be slow. I don't play games but for sure its not suitable for playing heavy games.
Battery is good will come for more than 2.5 days with normal usage. Best for elders.
Display is okay.
Side mounted finger print sensor is cool.
Price is quite high with the above drawbacks.",3
this product is good,3
"Looks great, working properly, unlike fitbit varsa which I am using it for more than 1 yr., If you move your hands bolt is not counting as steps.. at this range, product offers gr8 features.",3
Good Product Excellent Delivery,3
"Very poor wifi coverage on both the bands.
Two primary issues :

1. Dead zones - Mine is a very small home at just around 500 sqft but there are areas where the signal just dies.
2. Inconsistent signal - I have noticed that the wifi signal works fine for a while and suddenly either totally dies or becomes extremely poor. This happens on both the bands. I used an app to check for a better wifi channel but this issue was present in all the channels I tried.

Overall you definitely just get what u pay for.. Barely. I will try this for a while longer to see how it fares long term but would definitely choose a better router from a more premium brand in future for peace of mind.",3
The product is good .However its too tight at the ears even after making the adjustments. It leads to discomfort/pain after using for a couple of minutes.,3
Camera shutter option not working.. Bit disappointed,3
Excellent for me,3
"Good monitor but required cables like hdmi is missing. Also the power cable is very big and it initiates another additional purchase.
If it can work with 6A or 10A adapter then what is point in giving 15A.",3
The range of Wifi is not good. It works well in my 180 SqFt room but just outside the room the signal strength becomes weak. A little farther away the signal strength is not usable.,3
"I bought this 3 months back and it's broken now as it was all plastic and not much flexible. The product says we have 1-year warranty but physical damage isn'tincluded. Bad experience. I have fixed it with fevi quick as a temporary solution, but I don't know how much time it would work.😢",3

"ITEM SENT IN GOOD CONDITIONS. BASS and SOUND QUALITY NOT BAD ACCORDING TO PRICE RANGE ~ BUT PROBLEMS R IN SPECIFICATIONS !!
1. LED NOT TURNS BLUE AFTER FULL-CHARGE ~ AS MENTIONED IN MANUAL. SO IT’s A PROBLEM TO KNOW WHETHER ITS FULLY CHARGED OR NOT IN OFF MODE.
2. LED TOO TINY & TOO INDISTINCT & HARDLY VISIBLE DURING CHARGE !! KEEP UR ROOM LIGHT OFF & SEE WHETHER ITS BLUE OR RED !!
3. POWER RESUME OPTION SOMETIMES NOT WORKS ~ MEANS EVRYTIME IT STARTS FROM BEGINNING TO PLAY !!
4. MEMORY CARD DOES NOT START PLAY AUTOMATICALLY ~ AS MENTIONED IN MANUAL.
U HV TO PUSH PLAY BUTTON.
5. BUTTONS R VERY MUCH FLAT & INDISTINCT. U HV TO FIND IT LIKE A BLIND PERSON BY TOUCH. SO ITS ALWAYS CONFUSING. MOREOVER NEX & VOLUME BUTTONS R SAME. SO ITS MORE CONFUSING & LITTLE COMPLICATED !!
6. COLOUR LOOKING LIKE BRILLIANT RED OR DEEP ORANGE IN PICTURES. BUT ITS ACTUALLY PALE RED ~ WHICH I DISLIKE VERY MUCH. KIDS & CHILDISH FOLKS LIKE THIS COLOUR USUALLY.
A BRAND Or A COMPANY SHOULD B MORE CAREFUL OF ALL THIS THINGS.
IT SEEMS FUNCTIONERIES DEZINERS OF THIS BRAND OR COMPANY R NOT RICH-THOUGHT OR WELL-SENSITIVE. THEY R JUST MARKETING PEOPLE !!
7. THE RIGHT SIDE STRETCH-LOCK IS LITTLE LOOSE. IT ALWAYS COMES OUT 1 / 2 NOTCHES DURING LISTENING.
8. IN MEMORY CARD MODE ~ ITS A PROBLEM TO PAIR BLUTUTH. U NEED TO POWER IT OFF THEN PAIR AGAIN !!
9. BLUETOOTH VERSION MENTIONED IN AMAZON ~ VERSION 5. WHERE MANUAL SAYS ~ ITS 4.2 !
WHATEVER IT IS ~ IT HAS 1 / 2 SECONDS DELAY IN VIDEO PLAY !! SO DELICATE PROBLEMs FOR GAMERS & MUSICIANS !!
10. AS BECAUSE BODY COLOR IS BLACK ~ ITS A PROBLEM TO FIND THE PORT & WHOLE DURING PLUG OR JACK IN !!
DEZINERS AGAIN PROVED ~ NONSENSE & SENSELESS !!
PLAYBACK INTERVALS 2 SECONDS IS OPTIMUM ~ ACCORDING TO ME. BUT I FIND IT IRREGULAR MAXIMUM TIME.

"Its ok in terms of audio, but i didn't like the build. But when ever the wire is moved near the port, the media gets paused. But that didn't happen with other headphones.",3
"Wifi strength not good enough for area mentioned
However, 5G speed is good but have to be close to the router",3
Gets slow sometimes. Gets heated up after 12 hours of continues usage. Signal coverage is not too notch,3

"The headset is OK but while showing its call and audio connectivity but there is no sound in the headphones while calling, then I turned off the Bluetooth option 5 to 6 times and reconnected and then restarted the mobile, still had the same problem, ptron almost the same problem. I used to have pTron buds that also used to leave the connection when connected. The rest of the sound quality is very nice.",3
I had buy this product on September and not it's gonna be around 5 months but this headphone is good just it's not good for noise cancellations... And also you have handle with care. And now I'm updating it from 4 star to 1 star becoz it's broke by own idk how but the quality of material used isn't good and have much durability and flexibility. Don't buy it..,3

"I have worked for fair amount on some really good monitors and this isn't one of them. Only reason I bought this is because of 5 star ratings. Most people who have rated it 5 stars have probably not used a good display before and they got amazed easily after purchasing this. But believe me DO NOT buy this if you have already used a good monitor like Dell or Apple. You can purchase two for dual monitor setups because both have mostly similar colours. Let me tell you why I'm saying this.
Pros: Cheap, Sturdy construction, thin bezels, non glossy finish unlike Samsung's or LG's ugly shiny displays. Thats it.
Cons: very poor color calibration, in some cases the colours are just worn out and in some cases it gets overexposed,
Speakers...they suck 2/10 score,
The ports, there should have been at least one display port.
Brightness (it is too bright on its default settings, you can keep it that way if you want some more addition to your electricity bill)
Saturation, hue options are useless and only makes it look worse.
The eye care tech is nothing but a gimmick.

I have been using a Dell 21.5 inches monitor for almost 7 years now and even now its a lot better than this Benq one. My Dell monitor has thin borderless bezels, accurate colours, a good display screen and even has the ability to overclock from default 60 hz...I've raised mine to 74hz.
Honestly if Dell was selling this monitor right now, I would have purchased it without a second thought. I had to purchase Benq because I needed something cheaper.
Instead of the useless speakers and stupid eye care tech, they should have made a better panel with accurate colours and brightness.
I am disappointed.
Update: After many-many trail and errors and web research, I am somewhat able to adjust the monitor's display to somewhat accurate colours. Still I won't recommend it to people who have already used a good display.",3
Quality is not acceptable. After 6 month of use you will definitely get issue. Either yours speakers will gone or yours mic. So never recommended it.,3
Print quality is not that great,3
"Range falk short of expectations but overall speed is noticeably , but what use of 5 antennas without range, i had used old wrt54g linksys but new is only half of it ramge despite tall claim of ñ series range penetrations, here even ac series is failed",3

"Does the job,but like every other consumer I tend to spend on products which justify the price ,I have to give only three stars because if you personally use the product you would be knowing it's value and according to me it should be below 1k as it supports only one power rating and has only 6 months warranty ,I need a urgent solution to WiFi interruption and thus seem to the better viable methood then splurging on a big ups",3

Nope. The 5Ghz band coverage area is downright not satisfactory. 3 stars for the router config GUI.,3
wifi signal is not good,3
"Speed is raisng and lowering, not gives better performance.",3
Product quality is good but it's button us not there. Without button how can I operate watch.. I came back today to my house and opened the product by myself. But the peice was missing. There is diffect in the product. Please make sure it does not happen again back in the future. Rn giving second chance by only replacing.,3
As per the price range it is the best,3
Print quality is pretty ordinary and not of high resolution. Installation can be done by buyer without need of customer support by following the printed installation manual which comes with the package. WiFi is kind of ok. Need to deactivate data service on mobile if printing directly from mobile without any router. .. one good part is that it can continuously print for 10-12 hours a day without much trouble. Onsite support during warranty is available and generally available within 24 hours.,3

Overall good. But the buds quality is below avg Like those we buy from street quality avg. Sound is good. A little higher on the bass. But ffs who needs a stupid pouch.

EDIT :- I got my my replacement and its working fine thanks to amazon",3
Acciracy is like a joke,3
Easy to configure but has limited Ethernet ports. A compromise with only 2 ports but range is better with 4 antennas.,3
Need to focus on noise cancellation. I would categorize them under basic bluetooth headphones.,3
"Negatives:

1. The NoiseFit IOS app is very slow and sluggish.
2. The monthly step, sleep data is not captured at all.
3. There are no proper updates for IOS app.
4. The sleep tracker is not working after a app update and the support team is very slow to resolve the issue as I am still struggling to get the issue fixed - it’s been 3 weeks.

Positives :

1. The device is very light and easy to wear.
2. The step tracking and heart rate is accurate
3. Battery life comes close to 8-10 days with 24*7 heart rate and wrist sense on.
4. The touch response and overall quality is good for the price.",3

Product is good but one of the speaker is not working.,3
"I use it for about a month now. And I would say it's an average watch. Better than bolt, amazfit bip and all but not up to the mark.
Battery is not as per company's claim but will give you 2-3 days for sure..
Overall I would say who want a decent smart watch with big screen they should go for this, but if you can increase your budget then go for better quality.",3
"material quality is good... sound quality is decent.. was hoping for a better bass at this price range, jbl provides better sound at the same price but a big no-no for calling.. microphone is awful.. catches even the slightest of friction with clothes and makes the mess of a phone call",3

Only problem is sound leakage , everyone can enjoy whatever u r listening , so stay careful while using it before ur family members...",3

"When you buy this watch you are paying more towards hiring A super star like Akshay Kumar than the product itself. .
The watch rarely connects with my I phone, as a result you will never be able to use many of its features in the app down loaded in the phone.
Its step tracking is flawed as it counts steps even if I am moving in a car.
Heart and SpO2 reading feels fine but blood pressure absolutely not up to the mark . .

"Good but it should be balanced
On connecting with diff phones it has diff output.
If u r song lover and u need quality then don't go for it.
Bass is good but if wanted to increase the sound by more than half then treble becomes sharper that is unbearable.
And on some phones treble is low but voice is suppressed.",3
Not good as much was accepted,3
The battery life is very impressive of this headphone I could use these for more than a week as I m not a heavy user and the thing I didn't liked is when at high volume there is little distortion in the sound and also the charging speed is a bit slow and I missed the type c port,3

Best for single floor use. No of walls in between reduces the signal highly. It says 5g and normal mode. I fell for the 5 antennas. It’s of not much use. Signal is week for different floor.,3

not a super printer. does the job. Print cost is high. Especially not good for photo printing.,3
Printer works well for 1 month and now it's showing this error.😒,3
Best product in design wise and quality wise.But the mic is located too far that it the sound while speaking through it is a bit low compared to other earphones.But worth for the penny spent.And the sounds are also too sharp.,3

Stopped working within 2 years! Not worth the amount spent on it.,3
Not out of the box product. Cx 180 is far better but this has mic so if you need it for calling purpose then you can buy but don't go for music,3
Ok at the price tag,3

"Software is on par with high end routers in terms of features. Extremely user friendly. (But no app support)

Hardware will make you regret it after a while.

Ethernet ports are not 8-pin. They are 4-pin. (Creates a significant speed drop)

Router is too lightweight. Even a single Ethernet connection can lift it upwards or make it topple over from the table.

2.4 GHz just isn’t good enough anymore, all our ISPs are moving to speeds that can’t be supported on 2.4 GHz. (Practically maxes out at 60 Mbps).
NOTE: This has absolutely no support related to anything with 5 GHz. Can’t transmit, can’t recieve. You can’t use it as a repeater for an existing 5GHz signal.

If you have a 100 Mbps or higher connection, it’s absolutely not worth it.

If you’re not particular about speed but just need a cheap router/repeater, this is your best option.",3
WiFi range is not as expected. From hall to bedroom where there is not much distance also speed is less.,3
It is good but does fit really well with my phone (Mi A3). But works well with other things,3
Display qualty not good,3

The biggest drawback is that it starts to say low battery continuously below 30% battery and we are not able to hear the audio of oir system application.

 it is a good watch feels lighter than thought, cause of aluminum alloy body, liked all the feature
-fast charging
-optimal battery life
-good sensors
-its splash resistance so its nice to see ita not getting ruined after getting some splashes while washing hands

though some have problems, like:
-if you have a bit hairy hand the sensors might have some problem measuring the pulse or SPO2(yeah I have kept the watch firmly cling to my skin) though it will get the reading but need some retry and fiddling with the watch. you have to wear it tight to make it actually work which also causes red marks on skin.

-the glass doesn't feel like gorilla glass at all, it got some scratches just from light bump on the wall as I was lifting my hand to stretch

==after 2 weeks of use==
-the strap is less breathable hence will cause rashes if not taken of on a hot/humid day from sweat.
it would be much better if realme launches separate style straps or breathable straps for this
or if any 3rd party compatible straps come out

Good quality product but after using for one year ithe leather part of the headrest and earrest started peeling. It's all mess now. Still audio quality is good.,3
Frequently gets disconnected on continuous usage. Price shall be less,3
Router is ok. But I feel it seems to stop after running few hours. I had to reboot manually to start it over.,3

The volume is average. Should have been much louder for a brand like JBL. So try other options.,3

This product was good initially with backup of min 2hrs and after around 18months battery backup is not even coming for 20mins. Better to go for regular UPS instead of paying 2k just for 1.5 yrs,3
"All you need to know:
This not the regular noise cancelling or a regular JBL headphones its misleading, but the mic cuts out some of the background noise passively like heavy breathing, wind, AC and fan and other humming sounds. The other person may not get distracted with the background noise. Audio is good over call, no base so the voice comes out clean but note the music also will be very neutral with next to no base no matter how good your sound source is. If you are a neutral music lover then its okay but definitely not bad.

For long calls its good, no pressure on the skull being over the ear type there is no ear pain, with the light weight plastic built no stress to wear. All these are good from taking calls prospective.

Built quality is less than average thanks to the all plastic built product may not age well. Ear pad is of vegan soft leather like material and comfortable to wear. Wires connecting the ear cups are exposed so careful handling is a must, curious kids may easily pull the wires out thanks to the bright red wire against the black body.

Mic is detachable and bendable but not foldable mic must be removed if you want to store the headphone in a pouch, cuts out some background noise but only passively so the other person will not get irritated.

Mic mute and volume button is in an awkward position.

No cracking sound like a cheap plastic headphones

Price: Not worth, should have been around 1200 to max 1500, had it had a control to switch between a wfh headphone with a neutral music profile to a music based bassy jbl like headphones then it would worth the asking price.

Pros:
1. Comfortable to wear for long time
2. With the neutral sound profile calls are crisp and clear
3. Cuts out some background noise
4. Light weight
5. Detachable mic with mute button
6. Covers the ears fully so no pain during use

Cons:
1. Too much Plasticky
2. Feels fragile (longevity is a concern)
3. Too flat for music
4. No storage pouch
5. Exposed wire
6. Not worth the price",3
"I've used both of the models of boat, boat rockerz 400 and 450, but boat rockerz 400 are way better in sound quality and strong base and if you want designer headphones just to show off and all then boat 450 are for you and it has very good deep base and the noise cancellation is very little but it's good enough for a 1000rs headphones.",3
"Value for money, mobile is good for normal usages like watching YouTube videos, reading news, & social media's. Iam ok with this...",3
Everything is good except the sound quality. It sounds muffled. No clarity. No details. But the mic quality is very good. Can be used as a headset to make & attend phone calls. Definitely NOT for music listening.,3
Screen and sound quality are not good other then that good Is product,3
It is not reached my expectations. Only bass is not enough. But also stereo and vocals are needed.,3
"Tracking is average, any simple device could do it. Step & Sleep Tracking is accurate but heart count doesn’t even work. Good aesthetics but for mere performance it’s priced high.
Can go for Mi tracker that’s much better. You can only buy this product for basic features & looks .",3
"Product is very good. But security is little bit less.
1.Like OTP can see with out unlock.
2.Can't access auto fill OTP.",3
"Touch not working fast and properly as per expectation.
And app lock not coming with setting. And mult app only for whatsapp fb not for insta.
And fingerprint take time to open.",3
"Low price Bluetooth headset. Don't keep too high hopes. Not bad. Decent sound. all functions working as it should as per the price. The only Downside is that its too flimsy. Have to handle it with extreme care. Extreme flex on the headband area, prone to quick breakage.",3
"Problems you should know before buy. This is a great product but
It measure heart rate if you are not wearing it Means give reading even if you try to measure heart rate without wearing it.
Not 20 days battery life, it's a gimmick
Charger do not fit in capsule
Count steps while riding
Didn't come with spo2 monitor like the competitor.
Less accurate sleep monitor.
Screen to body ratio is very less.
Every thing else is good",3
ok,3
The values are not accurate.. there are lot of watches with these features in less cost. I recommend buy this if u want to waste the money..because same features which are getting in 3k to 4k watches..,3
This is my second time purchasing these headphones. It's sound quality is good but product looks like it was manufactured long ago and had been in warehouse for a long time,3
Not so good just brand quality is good in this price....,3
THERE IS NO GUIDE AND TEMP IS NOT AVAILABLE QUALITY IS NOT HIGH STANDARD,3
3/5,3
"Good for mobile notifications and connectivity and overall, but for heartrate one can never rely on these products as they are not fool proof and at times not consistent, also it is expensive then honor band.

It should have offered a little more for Rs 2500.",3
Very good sound quality bought this in Mar 19 worked perfectly till December 19 after tht one earpiece stopped working BT I guess on the price I bought worth to buy even though it stopped in less then a year,3
The 5g signal is not at all satisfactory.,3
"The voice does not work when receive any call, voice only works if I put call on loudspeaker and this is happening just after 2 mnths of buing mobile",3
"The 803Bk Cartridge prints over just 100 Pages , Hence buying a cartridge for approximately Rs. 800 and and printing just 100 word document pages , surely tell you high your printing cost goes up. So if they suggest you should use this printer only if your printing is approximately 250-400 pages per month i would again say no as , would suggest this printer only if you have 100 pages per month.",3
"Important: I love these earphones, very good quality and good mic, but every 2-3 months, one side of the earphones stop working.. so you have to replace it. Just ordering my 3rd set after 4 months.. but it’s worth the price, I mean if u buy 2000 rupees one it would still stop working after maybe 5-6 months... unless you buy a product which is like 5k, u would still have to keep replacing... but it’s worth the price.. thank you for reading, hope it helps..",3
"Build quality is good, battery is about 40 hrs,
At 20% battery it started saying low battery very often. Battery drains fast when at 40% or below. Not for long hours usage. Sound quality is good.",3
The product is very good but the only disadvantage is that it doesn't vibrate for incoming calls and notifications of incoming calls are not shown,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Sound quality is awesome battery backup is excellent connectivity is good
But Power button not working after few day use I replace this product 2 time but still facing the same problem",3
Consume alots of ink not much satisfy,3
"Could use them for roughly 6-8 months before something gave in internally and one side of the earphones stopped working. Even though its still under warranty, JBL does not have a service center in my city, nor do they do a pick up and drop.
Better durability would make these a peach.",3
"It hasn't c type cable
Box was damaged
Very poor delivery
Plz check the issue, our trust is being low for u",3
Every thing is great...it worked fantastic upto 5 months after that one side stopped working...,3
"For this price it's a ok fir me
But the rage is a thing to consider in mind{ average when it comes to range}",3
Nice 👍😍 very nice fast delivery 🚚 Flipkart nice mobile price I love mobile,3
"The modem provided by BSNL along with the connection used to pose problem with multiple devices. I used to get ""this IP is being used by another device"" and couldnt connect to the internet.

This device has cleared that problem, but sometimes when my phone, Tab, iPad are connected to the wifi, my Macbook doesnt log on :-( This requires a restart of either the modem or the laptop. But happens once in a way, though!",3
"this is good product for money not too much good but yes good at money and good for older in home , its camera quality ,and built quality is dicent",3
Improve more,3
"My only requisite for this was : good wifi range.
But it fails to impress while using Wifi across 2 walls 15 mtrs away from router. So disappointed in range extension, everything else is great.",3
Bought this one month back. Not actually fully satisfied. I have doubt on the accuracy of the data calculated. Sleep tracking is also only functional during night hours.,3
"Has a low wifi range, but can manage high speeds and multiple devices with ease! I've a 100Mbps and have no complaints about speed, but the range sucks!",3
"I was using D-Link 300mbps and had no issue. Act fiber people changed the service wire from 2pair to 4 pair and was adviced to change the route to make use of the 4pair bandwidth, speed etc.
I find the Speed to be slow. The earlier one from D-Links was faster even though it was only 300mbps. I connected my TV / Prime / Hotstar to 5G and the remaining devices ( mobiles, iPad and PC ) to the other. Still speed is slow.",3
"Display is very poor brightness is zero at full and nothing at low, sound output very poor , Average product, not worth buying",3
"Good product at this price but viewing angle of display is not very good and sometimes its lags. If you want to do less work like browsing ,reading then it's good. It comes with Dolby audio but sound is low.",3
"Its just a normal router.. Range is 10 ft only.
Don't go by the specs. Broad range of internet up to 200 square m is a big lie.
Decent router for normal usage",3
"The cell look's n screen display is very good . so far I have issues with my connectivity inside ( did not have the connection problem with my earlier cell). Battery also drains out quickly I feel. Audio is average . it's just my second day of usage , so far ok with the cell.thank you amazon for the prompt delivery.",3
super printer,3
no issues,3
Perfect working up to 100 Mbps,3
Value for money good product...,3
The phone works good speed is good but camera quality is bad and also battery life,3
I like the boat bass head 220 more it had more bass but this one also not that bad. It does not have that much bass compared to boat 220 but still ok to use for daily usage while in metro or home surfing videos. Plus this earphones shape is comfortable in ear where as boat Bassheads 220 was not but it had more bass than this hawk edition. Overall ok if you want to buy what more can you expect in 399 rps.,3
"Sounds good but bass is real low .
You get what you pay for, never had high expectations, so i guess its alright for the price u pay.

Don't expect anything extraordinary ...",3
All is good.... But Trust me. The aux cabel is not good. It was very cheap quality.... And It's many problem...,3
Missing the Fm Antenna,3
It's awesome; just wondering how long before it goes kaput because of handling. ... And I for my answer in 6 months. Not at all durable. One speaker has stopped working. No clue about the warranty.,3
"I purchase these headphones in Oct 2018, editing my review now in Oct 2020.
CONS(before replacement by Boat):-
- cheap build quality
- durability is not that much, earcups got loose
- little uncomfortable on the ear, but you'll get used to it.
- wire was not good
- base problems
PROS(before replacement by Boat):-
- quite good sound quality in this price range.
- Mic is good
#Earcups got loose, then I had to replace them just after the 1st month (Replacement process took around 18 days)

-Earcups got tight after the replacement, nothing else.
-After 2-3 months started having crackling sound, then right side stopped working.
- Replaced them around march 2019 (took 20 days)
# Experience after the 2nd replacement:-
CONS-
- little uncomfortable on the ear, just like before.
PROS-
- durability was good.
- wire has a good quality, guess it was changed
- Earcups & the folding mechanism was working upto the point, durability was good now.
- sound was okay & the bass improved.
- mic was already good.
Note:-
1. You need to register the product on their website, it took me 6-7 times to register my headphone, cuz of their site issues.
2. They'll give you no. to call on, but it'll never connect.
3. When you go to their service centre they can't take your headphones, they only take earphones. Service centre personnel said that they don't take this product. I mean I traveled 2 hours just to shock myself, service centre never picked the call.
3. Replacement takes too much time cuz of courier service they use.()
4. This model's service center is only in mumbai. In my case it took 18-19 days on avg basis for: delhi->mumbai->delhi

Speacial Note:
# Maybe the Seller is selling the diminished quality products or idk, cuz durability, sound & base improved after the replacement.
# In this price range of 600-850 these are bang for bucks, but you may have to replace it.
# Now after 1.5 yrs after the 2nd replacement, wire near the plug is damaged by normal wear & tear, but it is still working fine, but yeah I guess their time is coming.",3
"Bass is not that great its better to buy boat for bass lovers with this budget else sound quality and noise cancellation is good.
Good for people who want to use for calling purpose.",3
Battery backup very poor and not fast.,3
"Ok for the cost, hope will work well for atleast one year.",3
"I bought this router for 150Mbps connection it works properly I givr 5 star for it, but i received used product with full of dust, fingerprint, scratch's and not even reset their credentials. I feel very bad for this kind of selling used products in the name of new products.",3
Not really accurate in steps,3
"Print quality is good, install and easy to use. Black cartige quickly finish. I take around 45 copys only. Rest of all is ok. Thanks to Amazon 😊👍",3
Not met features in expected level. No finger print and battery getting heat after charge. Need to improve .,3
Nice printer,3
The sound quality of the product need to be improve. Looks and comfort wise the product is good . You can put them whole day without any discomfort. Cant say much about the battery back up as i am not a heavy user . I use them 4-5 hrs a day and charge the case once in a week.,3
"It’s not working after 3 months waste of money
Can any one suggest me were we can get it repaired or warranty",3
"Ok product, does not measure steps accurately",3
"This is my second SONY headphone same model. After around 6 months, in both headphones one speaker is not working. Looks like max life is 6 months for this model headphone.",3
What you pay what you get. It's not 5.1 and it's not home theatres . We have a three right sounds and two left sounds and central woofer sounds in one central control box. It's cheating. Even right left stereos are mismatch. Left is put in right.,3
"Overall nice watch, but app needs some improvement. I've started using this watch on 60% and after two days it's been around 20% so I believe battery life is not 10 days and after full charge it will work for 7-8 days.",3
"The band is good in terms of built and design, but when it comes to accuracy (the most important part of the band) it's quite inaccurate, step count is more accurate (almost 100%) in Samsung health app compared to band. And the heart rate is kind of accurate, but it somehow measures the heart rate of air 😂 (it displays the heart rate value even when it's not attached to anything).
When it comes to battery it's used up 8% in 14 hours of use with continues heart rate monitoring. I haven't used the sleep tracking yet so I can't comment on it.
Design and build 4.5/5
Connectivity and features 5/5
Accuracy 3/5
Battery life 3.5/5",3
its ok product very slow cartridge consumption is very high.,3
"Simply 👌rb for normal usages i.e making calls, browsing, watching movies and Sattingg😅
Note:- it's not a gaming phone if u need gaming phone better to choose another one",3
Product was so nice I liked but the packing of this was so poorly build and even seals are opened so pls avoid this mistake and give best packing . Thanks,3
"It is good. it's sound quality , connectivity and battery life is good but a problem is that huge ear pain and some current like substance (not current)from speaker",3
"You would expect more coverage with the number of antennas this router has, but no the range is same as the stock router your ISP gives you while installation. The coverage is extremely weak. If you have a big house especially with potential dead spots this should not be your choice.",3
"Sound is not tat much, except tat everything is fine, u can just hear normal voice not tat much",3
"Sound quality is very nice
And base is not 🚫 good than nice comfortable niose bads",3
"In less than a year the paper feeder has stopped working. It doesn't sense or pull in the paper properly. Can't put more than 1 sheet, else it will take multiple. Need to push the paper a few times before it takes it.",3
The pin to remove the SIM casing was missing. The packaging and the documentation inside were shoddy making it look like a refurbished phone.,3
"A little bit slow..
I think it will more lagged afterwards..
Big screen.
Camera is not good.. As well as selfie..
Ph is For normal users..",3
Need to add some more features like apple smart watch to compete the market...!,3
मजा नई आया।,3
Mobile gets hot.Hanging problem is also there.,3
"It's too early to judge a mobile handset as i have just started using. So far the performance is excellent......rest future will say....
But price is definitely lucrative compared to most other brands.",3
The print quality is good and the print speed is fast but the cartridge doesn't last long. I had hardly printed 20 25 pages when the black ink ran out,3
"The printer make a lot of noise. Poor cadridge provided. Got over before I could take 20 Prints and Xerox together. Looks like a used printer or drained cadridges. No use in getting it in discount, cause you are going to spend more on Cadridges.",3
At present working well still exploring things and features.,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Just okay, Smartwatch, the only difference between wrist band and this is display size.
Pros:
Battery life is very good
Heart and spo2 is accurate sometimes.
Cons:
No always on display
Limited watch faces(most of them are basic wallpapers like in a background image change, this is one of the wrost thing from realme)
Limited features as comparing to any basic wrist band(I'm also using Honor Wrist band it is worth Rs 2k but this watch chargs 5000, only differences is adding extra spo2, for this we have to spend around 3000 extra.)
My opinion:
Buy any watch which is having bluetooth calling option is pretty good compared to this.",3
I would like to know if it prints black and white as well?,3
Product is good but pls don’t go by the look of the product on the pics.,3
Little disappointed cause the box doesnt come with any HDMI cables! All that bragging for 2 HDMI ports!!,3
"bought the M01 core for my mom and i was somewhat disappointed with the slow performance. the battery heats up while moderate use as RAM is 1 GB and there is some bloatware that comes with the phone. remove the bloatware and the phone works fine. don't be conned by Amazon offers as they offered a price of 4999 in the sale and now it is priced at 5000, which is utterly ridiculous. Camera is ok for video calls and document scanning but nt for pictures.
if you are looking to buy, go for a slightly better version of 2gb variant",3
"Looks really good , sound quality is ok , bass good , value of product is ok type .",3
Print quality could have been better. It is not also able to print half of the claimed paper from the recommended cartridge. Good for occasional use. Not worth the money spent.,3
Not that great head phone. It is just an ok ok with the price point. Doesn't fit on the head properly. Noise cancellation is not that great.,3
"Pros- good for laptop un interrupted connectivity.
Cons - this I noticed after approx 1 month of usage. once in a while (1 week approx) , I have to reset power of this backup to work smoothly.
Wifi calling drops frequently on phone, without using this backup, I hadn't happened before.
Verdict - I find it ok for laptop uninterrupted internet connectivity while working from home and while you are on important discussion.",3
This phone takes ages to get charged and after 5 days charging cable stopped working which I can't replaced right now because of lockdown situation. I refer the phone with fast charging. This phone takes 2 to 3 hour for full charging.,3
"The display screen is not completely edge to edge...it is like PIP...bit disappointed. While in Photo is evident, the display is not rim to rim",3
The head phone is made up of very fragile plastic one side is broken while removing suddenly. Used Sony one before could be handled roughly is still strong. Hope this one could be repaired,3
camera like vga,3
It's good but not accurate at all,3
It's an Okay kind of product... Earlier I had an envent beatz... And this comes nowhere close to that one. But still.... People may have different choices in case of sound... But my main problem is with it's pin design... Earplugs should have an L shape pin... That gives a long life to the headphone... With laptop... Straight pin is fine... But when I use it with mobile... The wire from the pin has to be twisted... And it goes bad within 2-3 months... Happened with my 3 other earlier earphones... Where as envent has a L shape pin... And is working fine... Even after one and half years...,3
"It's just OK. Tracking activity is not accurate and Mobile App is also not working some time...
Actually I brought this for its battery life but I'm not satisfied. Approx one week in a single full charge..",3
I just got the delivery so I cant give 4*/5*,3
Battery performance is good. Camera quality average..,3
Only 15% more improvement then my single antenna to link 150 Mbps router. Now satisfied with range,3
"Honestly the accuracy is very far from normal. A little accuracy is in heart rate. But the step count is very inaccurate. In that case this is a stupid fitness band.
It's better to add extra money to buy a better and accurate one.",3
"Pros:#
Good camera
Good battery...not best
Good inhand feel

Cons:#
Heat horribly
Performance not good
Not update after

:# If you are seeking for performance this is not for you",3
I didn't get the carry case alongwith it . So beware during offer season. Something will miss,3
IT IS GOOD AT THIS PRICE.,3
"Display is not up to the mark ..
But good in dark mode ,
Dark mode feature for all apps",3
"I like the bass and colour of tha head set and
dislike the sound of the head set",3
"I mean if you like bass this one's for you. I like the clarity of the sound more so it was a turn off a bit (I read the reviews still went for it, so it's all on me) but then it's noise cancellation so that's good too.",3
One should go for m21 rather.,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I have bought this product on 23rd August 2020, so just a nine months. Have a look at the photo. It shows that Aux-In socket and On-Off button of the headphone are in straight line and apparently that is why Aux-In doesn't work. Have look at the Video. It starts with blue light flashing that indicates that the headphones are on, the minute Aux-In cable is inserted the blue light goes red and then vanishes indicating that the headphones are switched off.",3
"Bass is not satisfactory and noise cancellation is also not good.
It also has lag in sound processing , the sound is heard after a second especially while playing PUBG.
Also there is disturbance during calls, the receptivity of the mic is also average.",3
"Very handy to connect through mobile and take print.
However, printer ink evaporates if not used regularlly. Good for only people who take more prints per day",3
Not satisfied with its sound quality.,3
Need to improve the quality of prosser and other features.,3
"If you are used to wearing watch with large displays, this is not the one for you. Feels very small even in an average size wrist.",3
"Cheap price=cheap quality. Don't expect too much, it gets the job done.",3
Worst product. No meaning of smart watch. Nobaccuracy in measurement data. Showing improper data. Don't buy this china made watch. No return policy from Amazon very bad services from Amazon and their technical team for supports,3
"Don't expect a smartwatch features in it does the basic job,
Sleeptracking is bad
Battery good
Little bugs are always there ,sometimes it does show the msg notifications sometimes no call Id notification seen.
Accuracy average ... Counts my steps in my sleep also... That was not expected.
Cant connect to google fit app as sends incorrect data.
Cant say about the other products in competition but these tiny things sometimes become frustating.
Overall cool watch faces , with average tracking and Good Battery.
Honestly dont expect too much",3
Not to the expected level,3
"Its almost 3 wks i have been using this device. we cannot say its upto the mark but however its not upto the mark and we cannot depend on this device.
the sleep data is not at all correct. i had tested its several days. now a days i am not wearing the device and sleeping.
The walk distance for example every day i start from the same point and end at the same point. surprisingly every day data is different.
BP is not so upto the mark and cannot blame on this device.
oxy level reading is less when compared to pluse oxymeter always one point will be less
heart beat is sometimes upto the mark. but cannot blame this device as no equipment except the doctors device can give upto a certain level correctness in BP, Pulse, Heart beat.
But at least the walk distance should have been correct.
overall as an indian product we can give 3.5stars
all the best for the next level development
varghese",3
It seems to have problem with bluetooth connection while playing audio. Sometimes I can only hear in one side and my other ear is silent. The problem often remains for a few seconds only which is good . Microphone has some problems while I'm using apps like Google Meet or Zoom. People on the other side has trouble hearing me speak. Sound is okay. Not too loud which I like. I tweaked the equaliser of my Spotify and the bass is good. Overall it's okay for now. Let's see what happens in the long run.,3
Volume bahut km hai,3
"Want to replace my piece..
It's getting restarted occasionally",3
loudness is not good base is good,3
"Good audio, even thou it doesn't have ldac codex. but only sbc.
Also the posture is very tight
i mean very
so comfortablity is less after 10 mins use.
rest nothing i could complain.",3
Product is quite good but down on the bottom line of display having blueish line visible in outdoor lighting condition,3
"The battery charging is very poor. The charging jack not working after one month use. Half of samsung service center are not working due to covid.
New buyers, better to go for upper models.
This phone is not recommended even for home use.
Only the screen quality is good, rest of features are poor.",3
"The concept is very good and the product is also very good. The ease of connection and use is very good.
However, at time, when the power goes off.; I have experience that the internet connection goes off for several seconds upto 1 mts. I am not sure why this should happen, when there is enough charges and the backup power is ON.
There seems the power switching is not upto the mark and the circuit need little updates.
This may not be the issue with everyone, and may be one off a case; however, such cases are possible.",3
"Nice product for this price range but if you really want something to strictly follow up sleep tracking and steps walked or heartbeat look for another , this is good on all those but not to the satisfactory level.",3
"It's ok. but not upto the mark.

camera is not good, battery life is good.

speed is ok",3
Scanner is not working on my laptop,3
"I'll give honest review to new Buyers. I bought redgear cloak in September 2019 for ₹899. Its a very good headphones no doubt but but but , every coins has its down sides. So first let me share my good experience about these headphones. I mainly bought it for gaming like pubg , cod , minecraft etc. The build quality for 900 rs headphones is much much better than most of other existing headphones in the market. The quality of RGB is amazing but the effects are random you can't control RGB. Another good thing is you got a volume controller on headphones itself. it's also got a 3D sound effect. Now let's talk about the downside , the sound quality : the sound quality isn't best enough its just average + my headphone's right side driver was producing very low sound volume which is very annoying. Secondly you need a Audio + mic splitter for using it on mobile which cost you extra bucks. The last thing i faced with this issue is its Audio jack stopped working after almost 7 months of use and i didn't get the replacement yet because of the ongoing lockdown. Hope redwood interactive will replace my unit as it is under 1 year warranty. After my opinion headphone is about okay okay and I'm rating 3 stars for it.
Pros
1. Beast build quality.
2. Aggressive pricing.
3. Damn good RGB.
4. Eardrum cushioning.
5. Auto adjustable headband.

Cons
1. Low quality audio jack.
2. Unbalanced volume.
3. No 3.5 mm jack.
4. Too big for small ears.
5. No RGB controller.",3
"Sound speaker problem , When the sound is closed during the song and suddenly comes",3
The cartridges are enormously expensive and use and throw. it cannot be refille and use.,3
Overall good but tight headphones + voice quality is not good when connected with aux,3
"It is look wise very nice and also foldable Cups, but it is not suitable for long time listening like for watching movies.
After half an hour, the ears are not comfortable with it's Cups.",3
Net working very poor eventhough wifi also receiving very poor,3
"Just good enough can't compare with the new bOat earphones. Fit good in the ear, sound is good. But my earphone problem in the 8th month, sent it to service centre still mo reply from them its been more than 15 days. Buy only if you JBL service centre in your city",3
Best,3
No noise cancellation even in full volume,3
Remote control not working,3
"I like the speaker 😉 but there's an issue with one of the speakers i have seen other customers with the same issue, please don't send an unworking speaker",3
It could be better... usb slot isn't working...Cable for the speakers could be long ... Ok for the price,3
Sound quality is good but I'm kind of bass lover so it not full fill my expectations.bass quality is not so good. So if you are bass lover please keep away from it.,3
"Idiots they didnt give me installation CD
Then I installed from net.This model no driver is also not available I had installed another model no which is working somewhat in my printer.",3
"Print Quality is good, but catridge costs a lot and lasts for lesser prints only",3
Stopped working after one year,3
"Device heats up during usage, setup is okay. I noticed it perform well on the boundary of original range, within signals are not good. Speed is almost same as original marginal dip. Multi functional modes are very useful and make this device versatile.",3
Mobile is ok but not usefull for pubg,3
"Absolutely great product for listening purpose but not a great for calling or skype meeting microphone in this headphone below average and when you are talking over the phone or in meeting with this headphone the person at another end will feel that you are talking for a very long distance so, call quality is disappointing and many times it gives trouble to connect a microphone with skype calls.
Connectivity is great. fast connect and autodetect. sometimes I experience noise glitches in this headphone so, noise cancellation is so so.
In nutshell, if you are looking for an all-round product which will help you in calling, skype meetings, and binge-watching then, you should go for a higher range like Sony but not this. but if you are using this only for listening purpose then this product is value for money.",3
Sound coming out.,3
"Good!
Got it for 750₹!
Don't buy it for more than 799₹!
Wire quality is good!
Good for gaming but but not good for music and video!",3
Small and beautiful but range is not desirable,3
I am okay with how this earphones sound but the mike picks up a lot of noise and also your voice sounds muffled and not loud and clear.,3
"Look wise watch is Good, But I purchased this watch specially to tracking activities. This watch not able to track activities with accuracy. Display is also not so attractive.",3
"On purchasing this product, you will be satisfied with the sound quality. Design is good and within a few days, you will get adjusted to it so that it fits on your ears perfectly. I opted to rate it 4 star rather than 5 star because of the inferior quality of it's wire and plastic material used. The logo printed on the earbuds will fade with time. Else, it's a good earphone to give a heads up in this price range.",3
"Pros - Sound quality is awesome.
Build quality is also great as It looks like premium earphone.

Cons - I ordered this earphones as It was written ""SUPER EXTRA BASS"". But seriously, I am very disappointed and returning this item as the bass is not upto the mark. I'll give 2/10 for BASS.

If you are not a BASS lover, you can go for it.
But if want some great basa sound, sochna bhi mt.",3
"Nice product, needs better accuracy with pedometer, & better charger (faulty charger provided: doesnt even hold the body in place, has to be tiedup with rubber band. Charging shud hav been possible without dismantling.)
sleep tracking- very good,
mobile app""Mi fit""- average, cud hav better personalizations..

Volume for music is good..
Volume for calls is not bad ( a bit low) have to put both buds in ear to listin properly.
make is nice, ear buds are not too comfy, after a while feel heavy in ears and start hurting..

but the downside of it is battery, standby time is fine.. but call time is low.. have to recharge it twice atleast in a day if you happen to receive frequent calls.. although in pandemic expected calls are way too low for me.. still battery is not that satisfiying...

thanks and hope this could be of any or some help to anyone..",3

Low cost low quality dont think of better quality.,3
Premium quality is missing.... Avg look,3
"I purchased this printer a few months ago and have used it for several printouts till now. I had to b really thoughtful about its feedback , simply because buying printers online is quite a challenging decision especially the notorious reviews posted by many. At the end you trust your gut and make a decision. For most of the time people desire everything for the lowest price possible however please bear in mind quality demands research and money! So this is what i feel about the printer -
1. It looks great. Infact it looks pretty classy.
2. I love the print quality. It does so much justice for the image you want to print.
3. I paid 4890/- for the printer. The image print output is pretty satisfactory.
4. I printed a lot of sheets. Like, i totally went crazy with my print outs. I was working on a vision board project (more like a vision wall) and It required quite a bit of printouts. I hate going to the printer shops with the images I want to print as I have privacy issues. But so happy this printer did not even fuss once and facilitated smooth and steady printouts.
5. The installation was a cakewalk. It is compatible with my iPhone and Mac. Easy peasy. I love user friendly technology.
6. I have always inserted one sheet at a time. Why? because i find that arrangement quite hassle free and convenient.
7. A couple of times the paper got jammed. #commonprinterproblems. I did not feel that I should mind that. Given the convenience of home printing. Everything is better at home.
8. I took prints on regular sheets as well as glossy sheets. I would tell you this- , sheet type hardly made a difference. In future i'd use a regular sheet. Not a glossy one. I just tried glossy because may be I expected 'photo print quality'. While the print quality was great, the final print washed out the glossy effect. So it is redundant.
9. The printer uses the 803 ink cartridge and that is where the catch is.
10. 803 print cartridges clearly read that they are disposable and meant for single use only.
11. The original cartridge exhausted quite early. I am able to say this as I later ordered the refill ink and refilled my cartridge and I was able to get more prints this time. (It might be because with the original cartridge I printed glossy papers and they consume more ink. MAY BE. I'm just guessing.)
12. I watched a couple of Youtube videos and learnt how to refill the cartridge. I followed instructions and Viola! my printer started to shoot prints again.
13. Now , when you refill the original cartridge the printer's ink indicator does not read it. Which you'll learn to adapt because in moments your printer will be shooting pages after pages.
14. SO after several and many prints It was time to refill the cartridge. and Guess what...It did not work. I tried everything. The prints turned out horrible. The ink was spilling all over. Even inside the printer and that made me very sad. Nobody likes a tardy looking gadget!
15. My conclusion is that HP is right. 803 does not allow a refill. Even though the ink sellers claim and list that it does...It does not.
16. The first refill was may be a lucky shot. It worked. I was very happy. The second refill was a complete fiasco.
17. Eventually I discarded the cartridges.
18. I logged in to Amazon and wanted to place order for fresh cartridges and guess what. Out of all the HP models , 803 has the most expensive cartridge. That made me very thoughtful and cautious.
19. Unless HP does something about the price of the Ink cartridges, the ink will blot your enthusiasm.
My verdict - It is a great printer. I love it. Love the print quality. But 803 is an EXORBITANTLY PRICED ink cartridge. May be i'll try the refills again when my next cartridge arrives and update my review just in case i am successful beyond the first refill attempt. (UPDATE- the refill completely did not work with next new cartridge ran dry. Also I noticed that the new cartridge printed half the amount of papers from last time. Not sure of the decline)
I am not complaining because ultimately I have to take everything into consideration. But going to the printer shop is a BIG NO for me.

Review Update 7th March- I realized the cartridge purchased from Amazon I.e 803 for this printer is not compatible. My printer didn’t read the color cartridge. It was an old generation piece and the black ink cartridge leaked during printing. It basically suggests that the cartridges are either refilled or not genuine. I later purchased them from HP website. Even though expensive I was content about the fact that they are genuine and have same business day delivery. I love the Amazon returns policy. They accepted the opened cartridge and refunded quite promptly.

Review Update - Jan 24- it’s been six months the printer has been completely useless and I e been wondering what to do with it. Selling it on OLX seems like I’ll be cheating the buyer. I switched to a new ISP and the printer would not connect. I registered the call with HP CS . There was a lot of hassle. After spending around 72 hours back and forth they sent a technician. The printer just didn’t detect any connection with the phone, laptop and the WiFi. Technician refused to take any responsibility and said Ive been entering the password wrong. The technician and customer service people were so smart to place the blame because apparently the only device not connecting to the WiFi amongst the whole list of gadgets was the printer.
Final Review is that as excited I was , it fizzled out so bad, that it is ridiculous to even think of giving the machine away for free as I’ll lose face if someone asks for a demo! I thought I’ll bear with the super highly priced ink but for a printer that doesn’t sync or connect, it’s a waste! It’s like a marriage which you realize is going bad within 6 months of being married! The benefit with the printer being - you have the freedom to discard it!
Interestingly I also feel that the shelf life of this printer is meant to last only for one bundle of sheets you buy. The printer exhausts post that! If you’re looking for a heavy use...you must buy the really expensive ones! Yes. That’s true.
HP customer service experience is 0/10.",3

You cannot wear this headphones continuously for more than 1 or 1.5 hours because your ears will start paining because of tightness.

Pros

• Value for money
• More activity tracking options
• PAI ( Personal Action Intelligenc )is another advantage

Leaving bass everything is well balanced. Mic is also very good with good amount of noise cancellation. The wire gets tangled, but that will not be an issue as you can jolly well enjoy music without ear ache or heating of ear. So, bass lovers go for boat and for others it is yours. To be honest fair pricing should have been hundred bucks less.",3

Looks: 4/5
My review: 2.5/5
I think investing 2k more would be a better option 🤔",3
"Overall Good Product :-
Headphone (only listen) : 5/5
Headset with Mic over Bluetooth : 3/5
Aux Cable can be used only to listen music so Mic can't be used on wire.

I have purchased for Video Conference over Wire. My purpose not solved. Item is non returnable. Check before ordering.",3
Good Fashionable Watch for a small budget. Needs more features to be added to make it more better,3
The sound quality is extremely good. The design of the headphones is not upto the mark. They doesn't fit properly. I feel uncomfortable in using them for more than 30 minutes.,3
Printer quality is very good but expensive colour cartage pending speedies satisfied for me,3
"It not workout for my needs.
Product is good",3
Heating too much ...when you open then only it starts heating... otherwise ok low weight...easy to carry.. battery also charging out in low time,3
Fulfills the need,3
I have purchased the item on EMI but still its not showing in my credit card,3
Okay,3
No headphone with phone is a disappointment .,3
"Product is good. For tikona,ACT users they should switch on tikona adapter and dlink router . Router link with tikona adapter. It is wireless without modem.
Packaging is worst. I ll give 0 star becoz cloudtail simply fold the single paper. Amazon is always good in packaging but this type of packaging means amazon will reduce the values.",3
mic is totally useless.,3
The sound quality is so good.but the built quality is not that great. It's broken after in few months.,3
"If you want a earphone with Clear Sound Quality but not very aggressive bass or no bass at all , this will be the good choice for you.
It is lightweight as the build material is plastic .
Microphone quality is not so good for call.
This earphone is best to listen to clear music with out Bass and not very much for calling.",3
"Sound quality super
Bass is medium
Noise cancelling is not good
The major Problem it is very low volume which needs more improve in loud otherwise it is a very good neckband",3
Average produced.Initially looks good ! But can ask me after 6 months ! Will apreciate if SNAPDEAL can arrange for the testing strips at discount !Anyways thank you si  read more,3
It was indeed a nice product . I thought ut would last longer since from brandedc company but alas! !!! It too came out like other earphones. ...one earbud stopped working. ..,3

Bad choice. No return policy by Amazon so lost money.,3
"Good deal at this price. Still can't beat the premium products.
Touch screen doesn't work well on smart watch. Bluetooth gets disconnected automatically.",3
i have bought this product a year a go at first it work very nice but after 6 months time it broke but thank god to the warranty given by boat i got new headphone but that also broke. at the end i will say the company is nice but this specific model is bad\defective so buy some other model product.,3
"There was no technician attending to my problem even after e-mailing them. Also asked for replacing the cartridges, which till today did not materialize.

Some Resolution not supported like 1900*1080 etc,3
5GHz WiFi Signal strength is very bad from Hall to bedroom itself not sufficient and 2.4GHz WiFi signal strength is some what okay only but network drop is there,3
Touch quality is not as good as mi band which I'm using since 2yrs. Call silent feature is not available and vibration during calling is not much good. The worst thing is u have to use side button to come back to home screen.,3
"PROBLEMS IN THIS PRINTER :-
IF you use TNPL paper , the paper would get jam very often. Printer is a bit noisy too.
The cartridge placing area and when you load
and lock the cartridge it automatically unlocks and black cartridge which result in paper jam and ink loss. If you do ink flush to fill the pipe with ink in case of removing and re inserting cartridge it would consume 30-40% of your ink within each ink flush .
ROLLER JAM is a common issue
PAPER LOADER JAM is another issue
errors that i received are E02, E03 , E04 etc. This is my replacement product for first G2012 .
It is solely for WINDOWS
No good ink tank printers in this price range other than hp 310 but their services are bad but Canon i think its better but I'm not sure . If budget is around 8300₹ there is no other options available than hp 310 and Pixma G2012 . Overall its a great choice for Students and Office work . Print speeds are slow but decent",3
Sound quality is very average and low.But ok for the price.,3
"Over heat at processor near camera.
without any usage just app installations getting overheating.",3
"Amazing product for price.sound clarity and bass is excellent.volume control button and call accepting key not available on the mic.

TWO MOBILE NOS SAYS INVALID NOS WHEN DIALED, OTHERS RING BUT NO ONE ATTENDS TO IT. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REACH THEM FOR THE LAST ONE MONTH WITH NO LUCK. I STRONGLY ADVICE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF AFTERSALES ONE SHOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I AM TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS EXPERIENCE. THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT.",3
"Router is good but there is no return option available. Before I open this router, i got another one from another source. Thought I would return it but there is no option for return. Too sad",3
Ink cartridges is more costlier than printer.,3
Band is very good. But there need to be updates on heart rate monitor. This is the only concern. Except this problem the product is excellent. Sleep tracking is very accurate. app is also useful. Music control is a great one. Watch faces are unlimited and good. But charger do not fir properly. It counts steps even we are going on bike. It is not accurate. overall the product is ok.,3
It's a nice watch trendy with awesome features However with the cost more wallpaper should have been added to look more trendy or an update should be available to get more wallpaper on watch to look and feel new everytime you wear it,3
"I have received a call from technician Amazon,so very helpful,,mobile is going well now",3
"It's good on the pics but after ten minute it's a mess
It's a waste of money",3
Print quality is okay,3
"Mobile phone is worth for 7499/-.
Cons:
Display is not so bright",3
"The router is easy to setup and install. It (mostly) gives provides decent speeds. And that’s the troubling part (mostly). It’s a very inconsistent router, one moment it shines the other it turns into a stone. The performance issues are too great for anyone to compromise. You are better off buying a cheaper version or going all out for one of those 10k routers. Unfortunately the middle ground is just muck right now, hopefully this gets better in the second or third generation. Right now, I’d say stay away.",3
"Very good👍
Something heavy weight.",3
"Been months with this watch!
Honestly i am kinda dissapointed how the wrist lift doesnt work properly.

Overall its a nice watch like you can have it as a gadget not much reliable.
Still some functions are good.
Its a good buy if you are willing to own one",3
It looks nice but function wise there are lots of things they need to improve. Even customise watch faces are also not available. Not all applications notifications are showing on this. For ex. Hike notifications are not available.,3

"The product was good, had bought some products too, while buying the products, the same, was available in prime only for a better price, free trial was offered for a month availed it. After a month Rs. 999 was automatically deducted from my account I was shocked. I called Amazon and checked, they said auto renewal for prime membership. I said I did not opt for it. I don't use Amazon prime other than explicitly buying products that too as featured by Amazon. I don't see movies, use any of the services of prime except buying products rarely when needed.

My discussion with customer service team told me it is auto renewal of prime membership if you opt for free membership ( I did not notice or understand it ) while taking it ( may be my mistake I accept it). My Rs. 999 was reversed after painful interactions and escalations with Amazon

I am annoied and really shocked that if Amazon studies my foot prints and understand my interfaces with them. I am not an Amazon Prime Customer, there is no necessity and need. They should not recommend or sell the service to me. Going by a Healthy CRM process, understanding the foot prints and buying behavior ( need of the customer) accordingly products and services is to be sold to the customer. In this case just because I went for the free trial and didn't notice the auto renewal terms mentioned therein, money without my consent from my credit card was taken later returned. ( But with an unpleasant experience)

But during this pandemic time when Life is at odds. Strategies of Selling, Upselling, cross selling products and services when need is not there is not acceptable, without consent from us auto debiting money is not right. Just because our account detail is at your access, this gesture of yours is not appreciated and sadenning. ( You may say that auto renewal clause trails below, in our frantic attempt to buy products which says that 2 more only left. All this is not quite Clear, legible, explicit and understanding to the customer )

I had held Amazon in High Esteem and Gloried its services and offerings. But now the Trust and Reliability is buried in the deep shallows of the sea and would never horizon again in our minds",3
Good but just like a normal sound of theatre. Not high bass.,3
Middlesome,3
"nice packaging, nice delivery speed. Sound quality is good but not the best. Sound isn't so rich. Bcaz Intensity of lower frequencies are quite low. And intensity of high frequency sounds are little loud.",3
"The look or the physical appearance of the watch is exquisite. I really loved thr outer look and it really looks like a modern version of the apple watch. The only things i founf lacking in this watch is battety life which is not as promised, collection of watch faces and the overall performance as a smart watch. It is really an affordable watch and the price is really attractive. But the watch needs to be more developed in terms of performance.",3
"Sound quality and product quality would have been better, I won’t say bad product, can buy this.",3
Well this product is good for casual listenig but not good for bass lovers as it has a decent bass with much treble but You may have to use an equalizer for perfect sound quality.,3

Print comes very dark. It doesn't give proper color..
Don't buy this..",3
"Review after a week use...Nice watch display, good battery backup but it's accuracy is questionable. Always gives different readings. Speaker missing which is a big drawback. Alexa works fine but most of the time it shows network busy. Overall not worth of money when it cost Rs.6999/-. I could get much better product in this price.",3
Screen is bit too large no quick charger,3
Good phone in this price range a very low price range phone. But teacher was very good I am very happy to purchase this,3

(TP-Link AC1200 Archer A6 Smart WiFi) Overall good product but if you are looking for a good range go for some other product.,3
The sound quality is really good but the durability is horrible as after just 3 months it broke into two pieces. ALSO the headphones are not very comfortable over long periods of time so definitely don't recommend for people who use this all day and every day.....,3
Just giving 3 star because of the multiple wires to connect has 1 headset jack 1 mic jack and 1 USB jack for rgb only 1 thing disappointed me or else it would be 5 stars,3
Good in the price range of ₹1800,3

"I needed an external monitor for my work from home setup. This serves my purpose. Since i work long hours in front of computer i need a screen with good eye saver mode, Its always ON. Cant tell much about sharpness of image as i keep it on eye saver mode.

Use it only for work which does not rely much on color contrast like editing images on Adobe and etc.

Even though there is a 1 pixel defect on my screen i was too reluctant to replace it, as i hardly effects my work.",3
Camera quality is worst..I don't believe it's 48mp camera..it's like 2mp camera photos..pixeleted,3
"Product is good. All the Cables are in the box, but they are useless as they are too short. You may have to buy at least one cable to use this product.",3

Good for short time ups for WiFi router. I had bought one a year back. It's battery is now not working. Hence bought second one. So u can expect this product to last a year or so.,3
"It is good, but if you wear it for like 1-2 hrs you start feeling pain also I choaks up your ear and your head starts paining as your body equilibrium gets distorted I would request you to envest on a good headphone rather than earphone.

Wifi coverage not too great. Required an extender to fulfill my purpose.,3
"First of all please do not make fake reviews in this price range sound quality is ok and second thing is the product is very vulnerable, you will feel when you will get in your hand. It's been two days only so I can't comment for battery life but in future I will edit my review",3
"Bass is low and no sarround sound effect. When all speakers are runs at a time but it like a single speaker i.e, no variations in sounds. No treble and bass controls. Speakers wires are small, all speaker wires of same length 1Mtr. And there is no Amazon packaging.",3
The touch sensitivity is very bad. It hangs and requires multiple clicks. Very difficult to play games. Fingerprint reader quality is also not up to the mark. Camera is good.,3
The finger print was ok ok battery life don't work like 5020mAh . Camera is good color correction is great . Good phone to buy under 15000 but Chinese branding is steal there on charger and on sim card slot and pre installaled apps are there .,3
it is only for fit ness and to do work out,3

"It is good if you regular buds user . But it’s hurt your ear which is not good for your ears. U can not put it in your for long time . Even 5-10mints.

The bass quality is awesome . Appreciated for that.",3

I used it for only 6-7 months n after that the wires broke apart from the ear phone side as well as from the cord side...",3
Those stars for my first piece.... I expected alot but ended up with a defective piece....I have ordered for a replacement,3
Cycle tracking is really bad....app updation is same as older bands...the only improvement I could see is with the oled screen....I drove 25 KMS while enabling mi watch with attached gps(no purpose served) and it showed only 1.5 KMS as it loses gps signal frequently. Wasted money...go for bigger leaders if u are serious about tracking or else it is utter waste of money.,3
Just 10 Days Completed my phone Speaker Damage & Phone body is very hot,3
"While the monitor is good but the power cable is loose and does not fit fast to the monitor. Because of that, with little shake of the cable the power goes off. Please consider replacing the power cable of good brand. This cable is made in China.",3

Feature are less controllable.,3
Unwanted background app this unwanted app use RAM and mobile slow down continually..👿,3

"Router speed is good.
Set up time: Set up took time as what is mentioned in Installation Guide is different form actual User Interface as user Interface is new one. I had to look up on You tube for instructions for the new User interface.
Over all average , not bad.
Internet connection through router is getting disconnected atleast 2 times a day for 30 seconds or so, not sure why. Disconnection for 30 seconds is not a problem during regular work but can be a problem in case of calls.",3

"I was returned,due to uncomfortable in wearing the band,for long time usage ,it is bad,only for workout",3
"Really really really worse product. I used it for just 1 month and then it stopped working. Never buy this product. Really sophisticated wire.
If bought must be handled with great care and not suitable for daily use.

It's sound quality is good but could be better.
Talking about noise cancellation is way better than it's sound quality.
Now about the bass quality, it's just worse than ever.",3
Bass is good. Tremble is annoying. Noice cancelation is bad. Or nothing to say.,3
Better,3
"Good speeds compatibility, but poor range.",3
Average printer and legacy software,3
"Got this product delivered on time...!!!
Device is working very fine.. & inspite 3 to 4 walls in between the range is good enough to be used...
Only problem is the technical support provided by TP-Link customer care, none of the technical support guys are available anytime u make a call.

The mobile is very nice. One thing I don't like its screen/display. Its not having a complete white display looks like little yellow.,3
Poor sound quality. No bass. Just a simple headphone. We don't use them to fold. So if you are bass lover. Don't buy this crap. Go for JBL,3

Very poor,3
GOOD PRODUCT FOR ITS PRICE,3
Quality and all is good but it's expensive,3
"I needed more space along with my macbook pro and after looking at the ratings I bought this. Most of the time I work using terminal app and font is not crisp, letters are faded and pixelated when used with small fonts. Color reproduction is awful. Now i regret the purchase as this can not be returned (replacement is available but that will not serve my purpose). Instead I should have purchased 24"" monitor. If you use very large fonts and internet browsing or entertainment is your primary purpose, then go for it.

If you want decent resolution on 27"" inch go for WQHD/QHD, but not full hd.",3
"Stopped working after a year, contacted support they provided replacement without adapter.",3
One hour continue operate so I face overheating,3
It performs well but sometimes touch issues comes.,3

With Edit after weeks to this review, I started facing a problem ear pains after using for little time as basically the ear cup is round and not oval, there is no sound issue but design issue as everyone ears are oval.
And now cannot return also as the return date as passed in the experimentation phase.",4

The quality of the camera of this mobile is very bad. The image of the back camera is not clear.,4
"Product is good and easily configurable.It comes with prebuilt configuration for bsnl which is good as i didnt have to call cutomer care for that.
4 stars because the product hangs sometimes and automatically starts working when switched off and switched on.",4
So good one....obvious value for money,4
Got it delivered in three working days. Setting up is slightly involved. It's better to follow the videos provided at canon website than using the manual provided. Print quality is good. WiFi works well. Recommended.,4
Nice sound works well... Small speakers but loud noise great product according to the price.,4
Product is okay,4

Touch screen is very good.,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 This is my first time use with any fitness band , It is very good band for fitness tracking. Also step counter is good. It didn't have spO2 which is not big deal for me, because nobody used it after sometime. HR is alo accurate.

The only con is sometimes it count false steps but it is very negligible.",4
Ink cartridge come with Printer got emptied very soon,4

Notification prob and connectivity,4
Good daily use,4
"Camara is average, phone hangings sometime. Speaker quality is good.",4
Sound quality is really nice. Bass quality is really good.,4
"This is my first smart band,loved it...it helps in fitness tracking, sleep analysis, and notify things which I don't need to look after phone often,full message can be read here.If you already have mi band 3 then this not an great deal expect amoled display and music control.it gives good battery life,and sucks only 5-7% a day with most notification on.A must buy product if you aware of your health and fitness,but I have one issue which is you can't wear it while you are riding with jacket and glove because when in contact it automatically opens and selecting some options... screen lock in settings is also not helpful in this case... otherwise good product.",4
"Tested all the features bluetooth,USB,Memory Card and TV everything works fine....Worth the investment",4
This is one of good smart watch having gps. For those who want to do outdoor exercise like running/cycling this can be of great help. It has a PAI indicator which constantly keeps you motivated to workout.,4
Shajitha.Initially looks good ! But can ask me after 6 months ! Will apreciate if SNAPDEAL can arrange for the testing strips at discount !Anyways thank you si  read more,4
Good product you can buy it.. I will recommend you go for it,4
Speaker damage,4
"Well I've been using these earphones for over6 months now and the quality is still pretty same.

They fit well, the sound is crisp and clear. It is not as loud as some others but definitely the best at this price range.

Bass is well managed !",4
"Mi fit app, wasn't that good
Many time loosing Bluetooth connectivity and take longtime or sometimes doesn't connect (My phone working fine with honor band 5,there's no issues in Bluetooth), Huawei app is better than mi fit, and honor band 5 has more to offer in the same price... So go for honor",4
"I bought it because I really needed a pair of earphones with a mic and it serves that purpose. Don't expect good sound quality.. I mean it's in 500rs range. It doesn't get loud either, lesser than compared other 800 range earphones but it's super comfortable on the ears. I almost wear it for around 6-8 hours a day and I feel no pain or discomfort at all. So I'd say it's perfect if you're just buying it for the mic and want it to be comfortable. Otherwise I'd suggest to get something else.",4
"All is fine

Display nd touch response work fine

In this price range this watch is awesome

Go for it",4
Easy to use... simply...good printing,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Seen size smallet than expected... Nice features though..",4
Very nice mobile,4
"Best for beginners, but not meant for videography",4
"First impression of the product is really good
Built quality is also fine",4
"First of, amazon provided amazingly quick delivery which took them less than even 24 hours to deliver the product. I have a connection of 75 mbps(ACT) and got a stable 75 mbps download speed without any disturbance on both the 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ bands. When it comes to range, the 5GHZ is very small compared to 2.4GHZ. Overall it's an amazing product for it's price.",4
It is ok but don’t expect crisp image quality it fails in colour saturation it is ok in contrast but u need thik paper or your paper will be tissue and there will be issue. So sell your laptop to buy refills for this printer if u want to use it continuously for 1 year or sell your phone and don’t worry you still got your xerox slot 🤏🏻,4
Nice..keyboard supports different Indian languages..jio sim supported.,4
Like the more number of watch faces.,4
Indoor purpose only....,4
"Battery life : Excellent
Selfie camera quality : poor",4
"Nice One
Doing the needful 👍",4
good to go router without any hiccups....,4
I have bought after checking all the features. Hope I will not get dissapointed. If it was a little bit more slick it would have been better.,4
Its a good looking device but somehow its not capturing the face in accurate timing...All features are good ...call pickup facility should be there on smart watch....But its nearly a awesome watch.,4
I thought that this router's range would reach to the top of my house (my house is only 2 stories high) but it is the game range as my old router and for some reason when I connect this as my main router this dosent work it only works when I plug the ethernet cable from my old router to this I would suggest you to first see and sort out every problem before buying the product.,4
"Great product for the price. Not in ear so sound is a bit low but i am not complaining. For those like me who hate in ear headphones this is a blessing to avoid the inconvenience.
Good finish and snug fitting. Does not come out of ear easily so thats a good thing.",4
Blutooth range isnt capable far away,4
"Only problem is with Bluetooth connectivity sometimes, otherwise it is good!!",4
My battery is draining fast than the same phone purchased from store😒not sure about that,4
The battery is very good. With one complete charge it almost lasted for 45 days. The design is also very good.,4
"Don't go through negative reviews..go ahead and buy with confidence.If anything goes wrong also we can easily find the service for this, rather than going for the other products.",4
"Well I had some signal range issue with my previous router, but double antenna of this have done the job...",4
The gift wrapping for the box was not at all done properly inspite of paying the fees for wrapping. This is very disappointing 😞,4
Sleep Tracking is not working 😴😔,4
Better battery,4
"Using since 6 days. Sound quality is good, little problem to talk over in noisy space. Overall its good",4
"A very good buy. Quality is good and easy to set up. Though found done difficulty in seeing up the wireless printing, but with some assistance it can be done without problems. Overall a good product.",4
Sound quality is not as accepted,4
"What a model...slim...camera quality 9/10
Processor 10/10
Design 9/10
Battery 9/10
It been three days.good exprience with this phone.as i wanted",4
Delivery process poor,4
Overall it's good as am recently bought so couldn't describe any further. But worth buying,4
"I liked the product very much infact my sister also took the same product but different color. I would like to suggest that, in next product please add more dials in the watch or we can download in the noise fit app. And even to pick up the calls and we can talk on the watch. I hope the next watch would be good for me and everyone.",4
its a good price and does the work for the price i paid for,4
"Well overall the watch is good, it's been 2 months I am using.
Once charge it's goes for a week plus.
Pricing can be done better",4
Price worthy,4
Yes sound quality,4
Guys it has been 15 months using it but today it broke...,4
Good for use at home,4
"Nice product..It is very good and easy to use 
Reliable",4
Sound quality was not that great but bass was superb. Although I used it 8 months within 6 moths it's extending got broken I repaired it then after a month it again got broken then again plastic was not good enough but still I loved this.,4
Over heat when using mobile data,4
"It has very nice audio quality and bass.Awesome headphone.But,when you wear for about 3-4 hours then your ear feels pain.But overall it is excellent.",4
Overall nice product by noise.,4
It cannot sustain high volume. Cost is definitely more for the product. Should not be more than INR 199/-. Not recommended. If amazon agrees I will definitely go for refund.,4
Build quality very bad,4
Disappointment at Battery drain and remaining is good also Best Fit band 👌.,4
Quick and easy installation..nice product from d-link. I m giving it a 4 star as being a double anttena router it doesnt giv excellent signal strengh in all rooms of my home.,4
Sound was clear and awesome.. Worthable,4
In this mobile finger print reader not available,4
The product is amazing. The Bluetooth connectivity can be improved. Noise cancellation is amazing. The sound quality is also very nice.,4
"Material quality is excellent, sound quality is not that great for high pich, if u are some one who love base dn this is for you",4
"Band was pretty good, Battery life could have been a little better. The band's impression fell on my hands",4
Worth for Money.,4
Don't whether it is a CPU problem or monitor but videos aren't playing well. It has a 60hz refresh rate but still videos are playing with lag.,4
Speed is good. Its range is also very good. I can get good speed in mobile in other room when door of room is closed where wifi router is kept.,4
"Sound, bass, noise cancellation, fit and everything else is just good. Plus it's got a mic. It's better than the others available for the similar price range. Got it for 549
Edit: The right one stopped working after a few months of using them.",4
U gonna loved it,4
I liked this product much.. The sound quality is very good and the bass is perfect💯 but noise cancelling is not that much useful as it is not cancelling the noise coming from outside. Although the product is fine.,4
Overall a decent product as per the price.. similar details like walking and other workout mode calorie birn is now available on majority smart phones but it just adds better convenience of handling and managing things on a wrist band rather than picking up phone for everything.. so worth a try .. i personally would have given all 5 stars if two additional featurrs of spo2 monitoring and body temperature would have been added.. overall i think i would say 4/5..,4
Abbo average.,4
Love the earphone. Best in this price segment. Sound quality is great. After few months one side earphone stopped working so I connected with the support team on their site. The support I got was really good and fast.,4
Meets the purpose.. worked really well for few months but the battery died later. Reached out to their customer care and they helped in replacing it with a new one. Working well now,4
"Good for modarate users,, call, what's app, FB, YouTube, Video-Camera,
Not recommend for gamers 😂😛",4
this product is also wate . remote is not working . no body to purchase this product,4
Finishing could have been done better other wise product is very good premium quality sound is awesome . I got it for 550 cants expect much more than these .,4
Powerful Bass & Minimal sound output. I love this,4
Good.But Less Volume,4
Product fine but there are some questions regarding accuracy,4
"1. Accuracy is around 80%
2. Build quality is good. Band strips will get damaged slowly if you wear regularly.
3. Display screen is improved and nice than previous version.
4. Related mobile app helps you tracks your activities with ease.",4
I did not receive 55-250 lens?? It is too late but I did not notice since I am a very new person to use dslr. Pls help,4
"This mobile is just for looking videos and calling and messaging.... It lags too much.

By the way It's perfect gift for Mom....",4
The phone met my expectation. The battery life is good. Display is OK for me. Its a budget phone with a good battery.,4
"Fingur paint, camera and battery is ok but screen quality is not good, 4months before only I bye this mobile but now display gone, bad quality of screen, I not expected like this product from Amazon.",4
Overall its a good product but is not a show off material since it doesn't have variety of watch faces. Also the mobile app crashes a lot of times while connecting with the watch.,4
"No issue with D-Link DIR-615 Wireless-N300 Router. It works well.
My suggestion to D-Link team, pls update your portal that will be better to ease of handling user name & pw.",4
"Super base
Not expected this much at this price",4
"Awesome watch in very affordable price I really love it..go for it guys
Very happy with product..",4
"I have been using the air buds for a week now and it is hassle free. I usually use this between my phone and iPad. It is easy to connect to devices without pressing any button and all. Just take out it from the the case and you are ready to go. It looks a small feature but believe me it has a huge impact. The sound is great keeping in view the price. Highs, lows and mids are decent. I would say it performs great. The build quality is also nice even though the case is made of plastic but the ear buds it self are of durable quality. Type C is just awesome. Overall a great product.",4
Received yesterday...very easy to install.. easy to use....in all respects too good...except cartridge quality..not superb and as per photo printing the consumption is so poor.I have printed only 4 Pics A4 size the colour cartridge is finished...I have to buy today....very very expensive.,4
Though good it doesnt come with volume button like my previous ones. I didnt check before buying but I've always had ones with the volume control button so I expected it. Otherwise all good I am no music expert. But sound is not a problem. So all in all not bad.,4
"Cam quality is little bit low but okk
Phone is very good every thing is okk with it",4
Nice H T system working nicely.,4
"Initially software was not getting updated, but after a little patience learnt to use watch, in 7K you can explore health, exercise, sports etc for your benefit.",4
"The router performs very well. The build quality is better than its competitors, it will easily take up few bumps and knoks. Disconnections are very rare. It's easy to install and set-up. Also the range is quite good, it has effective range upto 7 sq.meters and after tha the range dips down by quite a large margin.As my isp is not that good, but still it gives me a download speed upto 3.5MBps without dropping much than 2MBps . It has got all the bells & whistle an average consumer will need.For the budget of 1000 bucks I don't see any flaws in it.
Note: The antennaes are not detachable",4
"1) The built quality - 4.5/5
The built qualitywas really good even though the most of it was made with plastic. The steel was used when we extend the headphones.
2) The sound quality- 4.5/5
The bass was really awesome (as expected)
3) Noise cancellation- 2/5
The nose cancellation is not that good, but you can adjust by increasing volume.

Overall- I highly recommend to buy these headphones as the product is worthy as you get awesome sound quality at lower price (I bought when the price was Rs.699)",4
Good built quality and seems to be reliable too.,4
Easy to install.The color printing quality is not very good(moderate).The printer is a bit costly in my opinion.,4
Nice watch and good in price,4
"Very good at this price, much better than cheap printers below ₹5000",4
"Great Full HD monitor supporting 1080p for a reasonable price. I bought it from a different e-commerce site for Rs.8180. The stand is a little shaky and there is no height adjustment. The monitor can be tilted, but the tilt angle is small. The quality of the picture is good, it is an IPS display with anti-glare surface. Comes with D-sub, DVI and HDMI input ports. Also has an audio out port on the behind, I wish it were located on the side though. I chose this one over Samsung night vision monitor because this one had an audio out port plus it was 250 nits while Samsung was 200 nits. It was a tough choice though, as I liked the idea of a built in table lamp to illuminate the keyboard area. 1 less star for the shaky, non-height-adjustable stand.",4
"This router is best in its budget.Covers two floors. Got 4 5dbi antennas .Got some additional features like bridging.Good range.
Highly recommended product.At first I received a defective unit. I called Amazon they provided me with a replacement.",4
Worth for the money,4
Worth every penny,4
Effective,4
"Display is OK ok.

Battery charge time is 2hr plus

Apart from these everything is best.

If you don't like Samsung brand go for iqoo 5g z3",4
Easy to install. features are ok. Net interrupts some time after one month.,4
Very good product. Worked well without any issued.,4
Very Good Product. But cartridge very costly.,4
It meets the expectation,4
i like the watch,4
Very nice looking good feel good,4
"Signal drop to zero after a distance of 36 ft, small and cute Router.
simple, easy to configure, they provide instruction on the configuration page,
Signal drop to zero after 36 ft from router i.e. 1/4 of the floor is almost covered
2 port(only draw back), 1 wan, 1 lan.
Power adapter cord is delicate, but the length of cord is long enough.",4
Aux cable is not working properly,4
"Service is not good...
My earphone is not working properly, I complained before 2 month, but they respond your invoice invalid, I provide which invoice which gets from Amazon site..
But they said your invoice is invalid.
I registered 3-4 time..
And call to service center of boat -912249461882
They were not picking my call everytime.
Product is good but service is wast..",4
Good quality with bass and noise cancellation.. Easy to handle... Money worth,4
"Sound quality is good but, it feels as if it's a bit bulky...overall it's a good product",4
Nic product.,4
Good quality at Resenable rate,4
Quite small for men's wrist.loooks good on female..,4
Nice product but lacks of blood pressure monitor,4
"Amazon alerted me around 1:30pm and package arrived around 8:30pm. Took it to BSNL Broadband office to do whatever was necessary (configure/settings). Thereafter, connected the cables at home & everything was working. We use desktop, netbook & (android) mobile - all working simultaneously very well (windows & lubuntu).",4
Good watch battery up to 7days for 10min heart rate monitoring..watch face collection are very less..and watch memory also very less..,4
"Quality product at an affordable price, i also own Bose headphones costing 15 times than Boat 450, but was amazed at the sound quality at such a low price.

I travel a lot and wanted to have an alternative set of headphones, not to replace Bose, but to keep up with the music on the move, need'nt worry about losing or damaging. I lost some precious items when travelling, became wiser and chose 450 after a lot of deliberation. I was expecting product quality compromised in lieu of cost, after reading some reviews. But it's not like that, quality of the product is gud, some people have the habit of throwing their stuff around and expect the product to last.

Coming to sound quality, definitely not to expect very hi fidelity, but the bass and vocals are gud, treble needs little refinement, and you cant ask more for what you're paying. Sound output/clarity & listening experience is excellent.

It gave me gud company during my quarantine time of 14 days, connectivity during phone calls and group meetings gud, was not interested to check games. Battery life more than 3 days for heavy user.

Control buttons need to be raised a bit above the surface on the R side of headphone. Men with rough hands(i work with my calloused hands)can't feel them, but girls with their slender and touch sensitive fingers can feel those bumps better than their own😉 and rise the tempo to nirvana.

Overall i will recommend this product to any music buff out there. It's a 'NIRVANA' true to it's words.",4
It is ok phone. You can't expect much from this price range. Touch is little bit delayed. With 2GB Ram more is expected. Camera is ok. But the main thing which surprised me is the Stock Android version 9 pie. No un necessary software installed. Also free screen guard and back cover available. It's worthy to buy.,4
"Beautiful to Look at, WiFi signal Range is a Little Weak, Otherwise it Best Product in This Price Segment...",4
"I like the fact that you can print and scan from any device directly connected or connected on the same network wired or wirelessly. What I don't like is that if you switch networks, you have to do it all over again-like uninstalling and installing everything.",4
If you are looking for apple watch type slick look then go for it. Tracking doesn't seem that accurate. I was driving an 2 hour; watch counted 2000 steps within that duration. It's syncs with apple health which is good. But I think syncing is very slow with older phones having bluetooth 4.0. I have a iPhones 6s+. Syncing too damn slow.,4
"Rupees 2,500 worth product...",4
Good packing n delivered as per date.,4
It's easy to setup and install,4
"I’ve been using it since 20-30 days, there has been no problems. It has helped me complete an interview without any disruption. A must if your area is prone to frequent power loss.",4
All OK,4
"Mobile is over-all good but camara not best and Netflix, Amazon prime, hotstar not play I mean ott service not available this mobile and touch response is not good enough",4
"Though it is a good one , it doesn't have proper flash gun support. Lacking this facility look very awkward.",4
All features are great but blood pressure is not upto mark.,4
Nice for low budget or for perents gift,4
"Possible to connect to ios ( iphone)??
Through cable or Bluetooth??",4
"Good product. Absolutely satisfies for the money which you paid. The Amazon packing was very good, there is no damage in product. Overall, a very good product.",4
Today i recieved this product....Its awsome for bass lovers....and sound quality is also good but not too much.... baaki toh kuch din chaLa ke pata chalega,4
"I am writing this review after about 6 months of use as most earphones i purchased under Rs 1000/- never lasted for even half a year.

Surprisingly these are still working well (*touchwood*) despite my rugged use.

Pros:
- Great external noise cancelation.
- Good clarity while watching movies
- Reasonably decent bass levels of the price. They wont let you down when the beat drops :P
- Being an Audiophile whose working for brands like Yamaha, Jamo Dynaudio, mission amd many more these are the best for music to hear ever subtle note however I have to keep in my that I paid 599 for these on a lightning deal which makes the superb value for money while listening to music.
- Gold plated connector pin for higher conductivity.
- Clear microphone quality over call or while recording a vlog.
- lightweight due to which they are not a burden on your ears and don't fall of your ears easily.
- Cable spread adjustable lock built-in.

Cons:
- Gold plating on connector pin is slightly wearing of after 6 months.
- There are better bass heavy earphones at this or lower price point. But this is very subjective to the genre of music you listen too. As to much bass kills the Mids & Highs. So you can call these headphones as balanced.

Conclusion:
Go for these if you're looking for a pair of branded earphone under 999/- with a microphone which will last you for a reasonable long time & have good quality balanced sound for movies and music.

good but less range,4
awesome product in the covid time to keep track on your health,4
It's Decent & does it's Job !!!,4
I'll give 5 stars if the product has more stylish watch faces. Watch looks premium... Its an overall good purchase,4
Good smart i exchanged it with my old one,4
"Bought due to price benefit, its ok small spaces like office without too msny walls or home 2-3BHK. Works perfectly fine.",4
This watch is very good and best in price it's screen was really best and it's brightness is good enough in outdoor.Bip u is have spo2 and it's spo2 measuring was quite good.Strap is not really nice but you can replace that's not the big problem.,4
Good product I like it.,4
Camera is not good,4
USEFUL and Reliable product,4
"GOOD PRODUCT BY REDMI INDIA...
Good battery and sound quality .",4
Buttery,4
The product is very good it covers the whole ear and also the quality is good,4
"Awesome, best cam to start with",4
Ink consumption is too high .,4
"Everything is fine
Except one thing earbuds quality is lite plastic.if body is of metal of some hard material then product worth for ₹380.
Then i gave you 5 star
For earbuds quality 1 star deducted.
Sound and bass are perfect but properly aligned in ears.
Great noise cancellation.",4
"Pros :
1. Time
2. Date
3. Heart rate
4. Steps measurement is great
5. Exercises modes provided are very helpful.
5. Goqii app is awesome.

Cons :
1. Blood pressure - readings are not much accurate
2. Heart rate : sometime does not show realtime change in heart rate. It would be good if heart rate analysis is also provided on the watch
3. Sleep analysis should be available on the watch also.
4. Stress measurement function should also be provided.",4
Best headphone ever i have used,4
Good quality. good sound. Good battery backup. Very good product,4
you can find a better option in this price range,4
Good on use but sometimes facing little prblm but am not sure due to this or wifi signal,4
I have been using it from more than a month with airtel connection. Installation is easy and the device has a good backup.,4
Nice product super fast delivery.,4
Good for better choice this price,4
I liked this product Before this product I have used tenda product quite easy to set up and use only Tenda provides manual paper which doesn't contain pwd searched on net. Otherwise awsooome produt.,4
Lags at some point and few apps takes its own time to open sometimes. Overall a good product for the price tag.,4
"Not much noise cancelation. The sound is bit feeble and coming very deep(like from inside a well or so)
That too not able to get multi tasking functions with this",4
It's a nice and small router. Good if you have only one desktop and less than 5 devices to connect to the network. I found netgear router easier to setup with netgear genie,4
Samsung as it's best in this midrange segment,4
"Only one feature which is missing is phone answering. Exept this it's every feature is worth. Good quality strap, responsive screen, attractive watch faces( updation of newer faces is slow).And look altogether is fascinating.",4
"It’s very light weight watch and looks awesome on hand.
Tracking is also good for all features like spo2 stress n all.

I had some issues with connecting to the oppo f17 pro but it’s working fine on iPhone. In oppo it’s keep disconnecting and some time even I can’t pair the watch with phone.",4
Wonderful product,4
Already have Netgear 150 mbps Adsl modem. After using 300 mbps D-link no significant change in broadband speed & wi-fi range. If 150 & 300 mbps gives same performance then why to invest more ?. 4 stars to shipping quality & brand name,4
"Best entry level basic DSLR Camera with less deal price on Amazon & good results. Thanks Amazon .

Only Demerit of DSLR seems to be lagging of Date Time Stamp option on photos .",4
Good product. Easy to install and use. Had issues with print output couple of times. Few outputs had colour dots. I am not sure if it was due to maintenance. Overall I am happy with the product and no complaints.,4
Je,4
Good working condition watch,4
Product is good but very small display size,4
"This review is for TP-link Archer C1200(Ac1200).
Pros:
1) Works well at 2.5ghz band and delivers max speed of 40-50mpbs on my 100mbps ACT connection
2) Good range and no signal drop on 2.5ghz
3) 5 ghz band delivers a speed of 98-100 mbps which is pretty good on a 100 mbps connection

Cons:

1) Takes at least 1 minute to restart. If you have power cuts then be patient
2) there is an immediate signal drop on 5ghz in the very next room in a 2bhk (1150 sq feet) . This in turn reduces the speed as well. There might be a need of a repeater to extend the signal if you want full speed in the adjacent rooms.

Ultimately ,it all depends on where your router is plugged in inside the home and how far are all the devices. I will suggest to do a speed check on different devices like Laptop and different cellphones because for me suprisingly the results were different.",4
Everything great except wire quatity,4
"Good Product in this price range.. The best part of it is its battery life. It consumes less than 8% charging after continuously connecting your phone for 24 hours enabling several activities.. If not connected with phone then it hardly consumes 1% battery per day.
It has no Auto Brightness option which is quite typical.",4
On an average phone,4
Worth 2 buy reasonable good JBL Sound quality... looks sturdy strong durable light weight very easy to carry travel etc...,4
"Good one in this range.
2,32 is good
Battery should be 4000mah to fulfill all requirements but as Samsung is a famous brand so can't expect everything in such low cost",4
nice phone but heating problem and hang many time but after one time hard reset it works like butter smooth.....screen quality and sound is plus point for this handset.,4
"Competitively priced but can be even cheaper to retain customers; anyhow product wise it is a pretty decent one.
I bought and have been using the same piece for last one year, no issues as of now.",4

"The camera is good
Features are useful
Easy to install
Very effective
Only issue is it does not detect motion or mov on its own..
Rest its a good buy
Talking over the camera is loud and clear",4
The way it fits to your wrist is mind blowing. Accuracy is at such a level that you can rely on it. So light that even you will not feel in your hand. For charging you have not to remove the capsule that is very fine facility.Overall the band look and response is reliable and fantastic.,4
Working good...,4
Good but. Better than other brands in the similar price range.,4
"Nice product, value for money , accuracy of BP / SPO2 / heart rate is good ,",4

When we use cleaner some trash and apps will be closed....",4
"Amazon delivered the product in time and as far as performance of the device is concerned, i am satisfied with the signal coverage across all rooms in house. Not upto the highest levels but modem is good.

The product package already contains splitter. No need to purchase the splitter separately.",4
"when i checked with the small size earbud it sound very silly but when i changed the earbud that fits tight for me the sound output was superior. Not as loud as my boat 180. but bass is really good. the boat 180 have superb base and superb treble so i'm able to hear a crystal clear vocals. if you are a bass lover then you can go for it.

my score :

bass : 8/10
treble : 5/10
quality of earphone : 5/10
quality of cable : 5/10
comfort : 7/10",4
Wi Fi settings not easy to install,4

The smartwatch serves the purpose and yes it looks really good on your wrist though it has a plastic build.
I recommend it to everyone who has a budget of less than 5k.
Cheers Amazfit 🔥",4
Fingerprint reader so first .The battery of this phone takes 2 hours to fully charge. Battery lasting 10 to 14 hours.The camera on the back is very good but the camera on the front is OK,4

"Decent and stylish product at this price range. All must features have been included, but sometimes the health parameters are little sluggish on screen. Also some deviation and inconclusive data observed on BP, bm and spO2. Overall its a good product. Maybe the Dafit can be improved by including more specifics on health data.",4
"VALUE FOR MONEY .
GREAT
Any way every head may get the problem from the aux area . It's happened to me after an year .
I use this headset for every day .",4
prompt delivery..small and easy to install.. :),4
Good option for Wi-fi routers,4
Battery life is awesome where as there is no fingerprint reader option. It doesn't screen hd clear view of photos while camera shooting and shows clear view in gallery after clicking. Disappointed...,4
"Nice monitor but lost a star because the ports at the back point outwards instead of downwards, so it really needs around 5 inches of space between the screen and the wall, especially if you plug a fire stick in there like I did. Also, does not support HDMI-CEC for automatic input selection, but the switch between inputs is fairly fast and easy.",4
"Wire which you have given is too loose it doesn't fit tightly in it, hence printer sometimes off automatically which can cause damage to the printer. So how ot can be replaced",4
Good product. In market there is already product which comes near to JBL at same or below Price range. I feel jbl should improve quality and innovation with same price or marginally higher to get edge.,4
"If you have 20k around to spare for a new gaming monitor, This Aopen curve gaming monitor is one of the best options available. I am really happy with the purchase. It took only 15 hours to reach.

Pros:
1. 144hz, so buttery smooth frames.
2. 4 ms response.
3. Curve display.
4. Has display port.
5. 27 inch, quite a big display

Cons:
1. 27 inch 1080p looks a bit inadequate of pixels.
2. 1ms response time would have been better, but considering this price damn I would have bought it with 5ms also.

Peace.",4
"Its just par, with ok kinda bass (don't expect any boost), and clarity, the noise cancellation is about 3/5...",4

Loved it. Good build quality and perfect screen size for my daily office work and movies..,4
So far Saw Good,4
everything works fine but the cable length of the speaker was short,4
Looks working good.,4
It’s my third piece to gift my relative but the posture is something different from other bands. The design is not same and it appears to be tilted or crossed on wearing. Users have to check the pieces on delivery to avoid disputes in future.,4
This product is good but not compatible with windows 7 ultimate. But you can download a drive from canon website and the printer will start working.,4
"A good one at this price point,everything is proper and delivery was very fast.hte screen feels so small on our wrist.",4
"got this ph @9999 in offer. the touch, sensor are really bad. especially face recognition, which never recognizes me.
application opening, processor speed with min 5 applications and battery life are good",4
"Works as expected.
I configured for pppoe. I was able to configure it in few minutes.
Wifi signal reaches 100ft easily
I confgiured following features and these are working fine:
- Traffic control : controlling speed to each wifi connected device
- DHCP MAC-IP binding (assigned fixed IP to wifi devices)
- Blocking internet traffic on some wifi devices
There are intermediate delays in wifi communication when more than 4 devices are connected but its manageable.
I recommend this for basic home usage.",4
Nice product sounds quality is good,4
"Awailable wifi networks stored with password must connect automatically
Every Time when wifi device is changed set up required",4
It was good but the black ink not working after one month.... I couldn't do copy...,4
I use Airpods second generation and I bought this for my father and I have to admit that this product totally worth of every penny.,4
"I like girls cycle and notification reminder, mobile app and sleep tracking... 95% accuracy. I loved it. And for beginners who started exercise this band awsome",4
"🎶🎶This is perfect having deep and clear bass which can be adjusted using remote there are no any treble control but can be adjusted using satellite speakers volume with remote.
The sub_woofer comes with 35W RMS and the speakers 6W RMS each.
Over all its a good sound system. 👌👌",4

Prize point is over for this earphones.",4
"Here are some pros and cons about this laptop
PROS:-

1. Performance is clearly outstanding with Ryzen 5 3550H ( definitely better than i5 10th gen 10210U )
2. The build quality is just amazing, although being a gaming laptop it's quite light weight
3. It's not metal but feels premium when you hold
4. The display is also good with IPS FHD ( 250 nits brightness ), and good viewing angles
5. The battery backup is pretty good with 5-6 hrs on normal usage like YouTube or browsing and 3 hrs on gaming ( depends on usage )
6. NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1650 4 GB under 50K is a golden deal
7. SSD storage ( 10 times better than HDD )
8 It doesn't heats up horribly like Asus TUF

CONS:-
1. The speaker output was not that great but it's ok regarding price point. But you have to use external speaker or headphones for better sound
2. No fingerprint scanner
3. No MS office

WHO SHOULD BUY:-
Although it's a gaming laptop, but you can use it for multiple things like:-
1. Video editing
2. Programming and Coding ( Android studio runs well )
3. Heavy gaming

It's the best laptops for students under 50k

I bought it for 44,990 in big billion days and I'm satisfied with the purchase",4
"It doesn't tracks sleep during daytime, so ig you're doing night shifts you aren't sleeping according to it.
Step tracking isn't accurate, if you shake hands sitting on chair it senses a walk and step-counts.
Not the best in some aspects.
But thumbs up for the battery life.",4
"writting the review after 2 - 3 month uses !!
Band is good 👍🏾 but its better to go for a smartwatch , the display is too short , sometimes it irritate me alot , mobile app after the update sucks !! band display easily attract dust n scratch !! tracking is fine !! no prblm regarding the functions !! battery goes upto 6 to 8 days depends on your daily uses",4
Nice product 👌,4
Awesome Router and Wide range.,4
Product is good but taken one star away because of no return policy. Bought for my mother but she found it too big and bulky but couldn't return. Not meant for old people in my mother's view. Good for young folks.,4
"Apart from camera quality, phone is good ,nice performance, good experience in the range of 5000 cost",4
gtreat sound quality,4
Best sound for this price,4
With respect to quality Sony did a great job probably it's the best in it's range..... When it comes to sound it's not that great volume is ok same is the case with base also.......,4
"Overall a decent buy at this price range. I switched from Fitbit Versa to this one, though there a lot of compromise on feaures & accuracy, still satisfied with it since it has all the basic functions needed for day to day lifestyle

Pros:
1. Awesome displays. Very bright and vibrant.
2. In-built GPS
3. Perfect size and premium feel.

Cons:
1. There is no Altimetric barometer sensor, so no elevation gain measurement. No floors climbed measurement.
2. Clock faces are very limited and not that great. Hopefully company will come with better clock faces in future.
3. Music storage is not there.

Providing this watch with little bit of Music storage and elevation sensor would have made this perfect fitness watch in awesome budget range.",4
"Affordable amd budget router, yet powerful signal capacity is gud",4
"1st day of the product..as of now it's looks and feels good. The delivery was fast. In a day delivery. I
Doesn't show the entire message if any messages come..",4

It is very good for its price. Trust me you cant get better noice cancellation over ear headphones at this price,4
"Packaging is super cool .
Sound quality is good.
Lacks in bass quality
Could have been better.
You cannot experience/feel music with this thing.",4
Good performance but bad camera quality,4
"Battery life is good, camera quality is also good😊.earphone is not available with this mobile Redmi 9 😐",4
Extremely poor technical support during installation. Upon self pursuation someone arrived after 4 days.,4
Sound quality is quite good but built quality is too cheap ! The prastic is very bad 👎👎,4
"It is very good but it is not that much smooth that we can use it for long duration, as i am thinking",4
Good and effective coverage in my house.,4
Earpods.Good quality,4
"Low loudness.
Satisfactory product..
Medium bass...
Good clarity.
Lasts longer..I've been using it from 2017",4
"Not much accurate but Excellent product @3450 price...u can measure spO2 ,Heart rate,body temp (almost accurate), BP....
And yes also u can't expect such a small device to perform accurately...
Must Go... overall Excellent",4
Great product for a fair price. Nice sound and good range and clean calling for zoom calls and meetings. However product is made of little cheap quality plastic . Packing was good but not happy with the sturdiness. Overall satisfactory for regular use . No major complaints. Happy so far.,4
"Thanks ,Easy to setup and install , You can do it yourdself",4
Product is Good. Easy setup. Very Excellent WiFi Range. USB Storage/Print not working. Using from more then a month. Always switched on and connected 24x7 but not at all disconnected.,4
Monitor looks superb as expected but antiglare 3h hard coating not working,4
Nice .up to the mark,4
"Worst Product Cartridges Are Damaged. No Function As Much As I Expected...
Please Don't By This Product For Office Works Or Any Other Heavy Works...",4
"Overall it has awesome sound signature whether it is bass or the crispy sound. The low and mids are well balanced even at high volume it might not hurt your ears. You need to tune your equalizer to boost the bass further to enjoy bass, it has decent bass as of without equalizer. Bass is not muddy at all, it comes when it has to and it feels like air punch on eardrum. Yeah! You can really feel it. I am sad for the built quality as the plastic cover used on it got torn due to curls in the wire. Overall 4.5 for jbl. idk why they dont promote jbl in india.",4
"Okay, not extraordinary",4
The app doesn't sync properly. Sp O2 readings not accurate compared to the oximeter. Readings are way off. BP readings are acceptable. Store orders service is pathetic. Not recommended if ordering vital products. very late deliveries and part deliveries. Back end support is not reliable.,4
For beginners the camera is really good especially the 18-55mm lens that comes with it.Its perfect for learning about dslrs and the camera interface overall is pretty easy.Overall a pretty good camera for the price,4
Worth the price.,4
"I'm not a fan of its build quality but it works fine as it's been 7 months after buying it's sound and bass are fine and good , is not 100% durable the button is not working and the mic is gone no voice heard on the opposite during a call or pubg play and I have shared the first image that the jack rubber has been teared off and wires are visible I need to gain warranty to fix these issues I request the seller to reply me as soon as possible.",4

good but not the best,4
"Using it from past 2 months, very good quality for this price, 1 start less, as mic quality could have been better",4
i doubt regarding number of steps tracked. it always shows High number of steps. OS is smooth. battery backup is not so great. i think will last for 4 days max in high usage. rest seems ok.,4
"Does the job, pretty satisfied. Goo signal in most parts of the house 1759sqft.",4
Camera is average. Display is average. The phone does not meet the expectations.,4
"The sound quality no doubt Sony is much better as the name is.
Purchased on big billion sale at rs15570.

Satellite speakers can be connected but not required for small room. Technician from Sony came for demo and installation which was not expected. Good service provided.",4
Camera needs some updates and improvements. Very good battery life and mediocre performance,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Bass is good but not the best in the market",4
The ears used to hurt during the first week. Now it's all good.,4
Everything is great about the printer but scanning can give issues sometimes and the web service to take out the printer doesn't always work ! But still value for Money,4
"Best product at this price point.
Built quality is best to others at this range.
Sound quality is good.
I recommended for mid range headphones.",4

Not too much bass.. morr like a natural bass effect...

Overall n8ce product for daily use.",4
"Just bought 2 day past router is working perfectly,it signal spreads about 15m radius and even this review i'm giving through net provided by the router.
The ethernet cable is not long enough so u hv keep it beside ur pc for those who r not using any modem having cable net connection.set up process is bit lengthy though not difficult.So at this price range u can surely go for the product.",4
"Nice product
Excellent battery backup
Vibration too good",4
Design is good,4
It's suited for beginners....auto focus mode is not bad....picture quality is reasonable at this price,4
good till now complaint,4

kit lens is good
but use better lens for better result
thank you bye bye hv a great day.",4
Lookd good so far,4
Bluetooth connectivity and sound quality is best.. smart and good product..,4
Reasonably good,4
Excellent router. The fact that it has a broadcom chipset places it above netgear dlink and tplink routers. The range is good for a 1350 sqft flat which was not expected off a router with such low price tag. Totally serves the purpose. :):),4
Good for elders,4
When i connect whit my mobile then one speak is not work for 1 or 2 second otherwise this product is awesome it's sound quality and noise cancellation is good but blutooth quality is not so good they show us for 10m but i think it work only 6 or 7m . But this product is good.,4
Recommended to bye,4
"Its a good speakers for home, looks nice. Volume is okay not to loud nor to low, Its Bluetooth conectivity is good, from 4 speakers 2 speakers have a long cable to connect while 2 have a short cable and at that time you need a connector which is easily available at electronic shop.Value for money. Remote control does not have battery..",4
Ears hurt form prolonged usage. I have to stretch the frame frequently to reduce the stress on the ear.,4
Purchased this product this May (2020) and I have noticed that the left side of the headphone does not work anymore.I can only hear audio from the right side.Please replace or repair the product as it is in the warranty period.,4
Awesome...lvd it,4
"good delivery by amazon, value for money item, easy setup and usage, wifi is not really that strong, recommendable for home use",4

"Very good item...but for colour prints in photo paper,there is a mark of roller line noticed ...otherwiseit is too good.got it for RS.7450.",4
Excellent Product by Goqii. Give me 95% Satisfaction.,4
Bass response is awesome. The mids and highs are average but can be good if you know how to tweak the equilizer. Sound clarity is good compared to its price range. The best part is the long cord and the connecting jack.,4
"The sound quality is pretty good for headphones in this price range, but I would have liked better quality plastic. The mic box and button plastic is a little flimsy. Also the aux jack is straight not an L, so the wire is more prone to breaking. The whole set is quite bulky.
To be honest I've bought JBLs in the same price range and found them better, but just a sugestion.",4
"This device is totally worth the money if the performance is not considered, as MIUI is heavy for a Processor like MTKG85. Battery life is the best in this phone. Fingerprint sensor is smaller than the last models. Camera is normal.",4
Best quality products.,4
"One of the very useful gadgets to have in our society filled with powercuts in hyderabad.. Been using this for last 4 months and is working perfectly during powercuts (Atleast 10 to 15)powercuts without any issues touchwood :) ..

I use this for my Airtel broadband connected to a Beetel 450tc1 ADSL2+ modem.

One glitch i have seen so far is sometimes it keeps blinking when we turn on and if we do a slide from off to on then the problem goes off.. Rest is good..",4
Good but no fingers print or face unlock,4
"Its a good router with a decent range.
The setup process is also very easy.

I am using it with MTNL broadband connection and it works seamlessly.

Amazon has been great in delivering the product the very next day.",4
I just love it....only in 749 rupee thats great and sound quality is amazing.....if u want headphone just buy this product....trust me trust boat team....thank you,4
"The printing quality of this printer is really good.. As i have used it.. So, in my openion its a good buy... But it has some bad side of it... i.e., Cartridges gets empty fast.. I didnot even print 50 pages there was a warning lamp indicating about low ink in both the cartridges.. It takes some time to set up and you have to do some printing ,xerox test and scan a sheet of printed paper as shown in manual then you are all ready to use it.. But the fact is if you use low gsm papers your ink will be sucked more and which results in emptying your cartridges fast.. So, I prefer not to use low gsm papers.. And try getting large cartridges.. Small finishes fast..",4
Worst product and this is a genuine review after 3 months the watch stopped working its touch not working it is freezed and Customer care is not helping they didnt give any solution for the same . Dont Buy it really is waste of money please for 3-4 months it will work good but after that it will stop working and i guarantee you .,4
The product overall is really good its features are also very nice though the only thing that upset me was that the company released a new watch just a week after i brought the product.,4
A perfect light weight and decent looking laptop for students... Worth the cost and does even give extra RAM slot (DDR4) and a SSD slot too (NVMe M.2 compatible),4
If your rate within 500 to 650. Without hesitation you can purchase it.its sound quality atract you very much.Also it's bass is too good but not very good.... It's built quality is awesome.,4
"Considering it's price,the product is good...and since in this price segment we don't get the same quality and comfort..so,its a bang4buck product.It's not good for listening music.The MIC quality is also good....Good job Red Gear!",4
Amazing watch ❤❤❤❤,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Accurate with steps counting and sleep tracking, great battery life.",4
"Undoubtedly the best Android phone your money can buy. There are no heating issues atall. Camera is amazing, have directly compared it with iPhone 12 Pro Max. Zoom feature is very useful. Battery lasts more than a day. And the screen is a beauty to look at, specially with the 120Hz mode. Samsung has done a great job with this one! I have been using it for a week and totally loving the experience! Only downside is that the phone is a bit heavy and thick.",4
Overall a good product in this price range.,4
Good product in cheap price and print quality is also good and easy to use but it's printing is expensive than other printers although it was expected so overall good product 😀,4
Overall the product is very good. It is probably the best headphone at this price. The sound quality and build quality along with the built-in-mic are all fabulous. But the sound upper range is only 16000Hz against their claimed upper range of 20000Hz. Else arre all good. Even at high volume there is no shatter of sound...it remains clear with high bass.,4
Wi-Fi Range is not that great.,4
"Till now it works fine.. if you are looking for earphone with good bass ..then definitely you should NOT go for it..
Else if you want headphones for normal purpose..you can purchase it..",4
"1.Sound is good
2.Camera is average
3.Gaming experience is good
4. Battery is good
5.Video quality is good
No finger print reader",4
PR ♥️♥️,4
Superb battery backup,4
"Worth to money, battery fingerprint reader absolutely valued as samsung's product, camera is good though considered the price.
Not for high processing applications yet best for general applications. Really value to money",4
"Good one in reasonable rate
Good to monitor health vitals",4
The watch was a little small on my wrist otherwise great budget smartwatch,4
Nice back up,4
"Super battery , display and camera.",4
"The printer is perfect for home use, hence don't expect rapid photocopy, it takes about 10~15 seconds to copy.
5/5 for quality of printer overall.
Now 1/5 is the canon interface available on PC, it's unrelated to printer directly however it's required to use copying.
It's behind the timeline, extremely slow and buggy.
I was expecting a fluid interface but it rather looks more like you're back in 2005 when windows XP used to make us wait till next click.",4
Improve camera quality,4
"Overall best phone in this segments ...
This is the best phone in this budget",4
good but I need better one....,4
"built quality is good it is made of plastic, Mic performance is good on calls, Wire length is also good",4
Very nice bass soundtrack,4
"Ok, good👍",4
Worth the money.Works as expected. Looks rugged.,4
Just wifi distance is little issue. otherwise this is the best product.,4
"Nice product
I think speed doesn't get boost",4
Quality is superb. lots of sports mode is good feture but sleep tracking is not works good and watch faces are less.,4
"Just normal watch , but problem in connectivity",4
This is good product .wifi signal range is pretty good and it can easily installation.,4
Grt product but jbl headquarters is in America....hence in this product is it written made in china...how is it possible,4
"Good quality in this price, easy to head mount, rather batter if bass drum become more.",4
"The mobile app of Mi Fit needs to upgrade as it hangs sometimes and sleep tracking is fine. Although the steps count is not accurate. Accuracy is something which we rely on and it's 95% accurate after I have used this for all these weeks. Black, small in size, good in features, finely charged and Battery is amazing. However, I would want one more upgrade, phone calls should be answered from the band itself by presence of microphone/speaker. Water resistant, good device.",4
Worth the price,4
It's nice. Please add silent button for call option in your upcoming model. There is option only to cut the call but not to silent it...please update it. Otherwise it ia really nice and worthy product,4
Work smoothly. No hassles so far regarding connectivity. Range is not bad...,4
"The mi fit band 4 is not very accurate with the step count but decent enough. The sleep tracking not very accurate. It counts the time i was awake on my bed using my phone. The heart rate monitoring is decent. The battery life is really good. I used the band for 13 days on full charge with sleep tracking and continuous heart rate monitoring on. It also has few cool features unlike mi band3.
• It is fully touch and you can change your skins on the watch display with mi fit app and mi band4 app provides additional skins which is available on play store.
• You can control the music playing on phone through the band
• You can access notifications from not only mesaages but other apps which you can select in the mi fit app
The other features that i felt really useful are
• The find my phone feature on the band
• The workout modes are decent enough and can be used more often.
Overall good purchase for this price point.",4
"Hope this summary resolves any1 facing issues with 5Ghz connectivity issues.

Hy Guys, I am using this router from a month now. 2.4Ghz was working was very well, nice coverage over my building. I connect upto 10 devices and earlier all were on 2.4Ghz only. After this router I could segregate 2.4ghz & 5ghz, which is nice. Throughput on the devices is nice and on 5ghz I could achieve 95M up & down.

Only major problem was 5Ghz disconnects frequently and had to restart the router to get back and 5-10mins same again. After a bit of research found that the my Iphones & laptops connecting on 5Hz are showing up on Blocked DoS Host List.

Resolution - UnToggle the DoS protection to Off, save the settings and restart the router. after that my devices never disconnected. Try this feature. Hope this is helpful.

Thank you.",4
"GOQii Smart Vital Fitness SpO2, body temperature and blood pressure tracker with 3 months personal Coaching is really one of the must have product one should have in this pandemic. it comes with the colorful exchangeable belt so that you can style it with different outfit while tracking your health.

battery ok but mobile found to be heavy,4
Range is not that great but speed n performance is gud,4
"I just received the product and the warranty page is asking me to review the product without even using it fully.
The ZEE5 subscription is misleading as it gives only a months while card says 6 months.
Anyways I did some quick testing and found this very good as it says in the Box. It is quite accurate with steps BP SPO2 and HR
Go for it if you such such features at a low price",4
"good, but ethertnet cable very short, function wise good",4
Satisfies my requirement. Getting 100mbps on my 100mbps fiber connection on the 5Ghz band and 40mbps on the 2.4Ghz band. Range is decent in the 1200 sqft apartment.,4
"Please choose another seller to buy this phone, RKLLP seller first experience too bad.
Phone is okay with this price, looks great...",4
"Sound LAG found while using with mobile (samsung galaxy Note-9, Samsung galaxy S20 plus and Redmi note5 pro).... 1-2 seconds straight lag even with the videos and games... and found 0.5 second pause sometimes specially when i play at 80% volume.... if possible plz fix this issue with the update.

Rest all is good sound and quality is good at this price range.",4
"Yes, its a wonderful product and met my expectations. It was delivered within the time promised to me. It has covered a range of around 20 to 25 feet on both sides of its placement, that too with 3 walls in between.",4
"Ok to bye, for regular usesg, long battery life",4
It's working good. Worth to buy,4
The product is really good.. night vision could be improved.. also major con is when mic is a recommend sensetivity it echoes all the sounds on your phone and cam.. very very annoying,4
Sometimes I see a gap in step calculation. If you are selecting walking and specially walking fast it shows a disconnect between what gets registered in walking and what gets registered in overall daily steps.,4
"printer is good, but the colour cyan was only half bottle and delivery was late.",4
The main glitch in this prouct is the charging dock. The capusle dose not sit properly in the dock. I am using rubber band to place it fit in the charging dock. The earelie versions of Mi bands had very good charging doc design.,4
"It was bought for BSNL broadband connection. The guidelines given for installation & configuration was crystal clear & as user ID & password for Broadband connection was known, we could start using it almost immediately.",4
Its Good,4
"Good range of signal, no break in connectivity",4
"It is a value for money product. Ideal for tracking your exercises.

The only downside... it is a Chinese product! Did not want to buy it, but bought bcuz no better Made In India versions were available.",4
Nice.. using from last one month,4
easy to install and very minimal bandwidth loss,4
Very good. But no cover case,4

Overall Good in 10000 Range for Day to Day Use.",4
Camera quality is not good and phone has lag issues.,4
at this budget ok ok,4
"Battery, fingerprint good camera average, software problem.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Writing the review after 1 week use
Pros:
1.Nice bass
2.Light weight
3.Battery life is top notch. I continuesly played song on repeat and it played for whole 24 hours straight.
4. Bluetooth connectivity is good.but gets problem when you are in another room.
5.Noice cancellation is best...I can barely hear anyone even on 20% volume

Cons:
1. If you are a sweaty person then your ears will get sweaty while wearing.
2. The adjustment functionality got loose in 2 days only. But as my head is big I Ignored it. Thats why Igave 4 stars otherwise it is a 5 star product.
3. Aux cable is cheap.I have to buy new one in future.

Conclusion:
If you are having low budget but want to buy good quality headphones,then this is the best buy in the market.Dont waste your hard earned money in so called branded headphones.They eventually give the same sound experience as this one.(I Had one Sony headphone sometimes back)",4
I like the look and touch of the watch. But im facing connectivity issues with my phone. Its really time consuming . Connecting with phone should be automatic.,4
Good dslr....but flash is not good...without flash picture is looking good..,4
Pulse oximeter.Good according to price,4
"The camera quality is not so good. Voice quality, battery backup rest all is ok so far. Buy if you have a budget of 10K iun this rage it is a good choice so far. Tech market is so dynamic these days it changes while we are sleeping, so I recommend to have a full market review before buying a mobile device. As far as radiations and heating problem is concerned, Redmi phones are heating if you have a budget of 20 K better to prefer Oppo or Vivo with extended damage protection warranty.",4
"Good bass quality, gives a very good music experience",4
"Not fast charging its take 3 hours to full charge I received bad charger but by power bank its take 2 hours
Kahan ham 22.5 w fast charging. Kahan to ma ha tha 1ghante me charge hoga fon good but charger bad aur only one day battery life redmi note9",4
The product is excellent,4
"Sleep tracking, padometer is nice. But it doesn't measure gym workout accurately",4
Best quality camera,4
As overall watch is having good accuracy and value of money. Only thing lagging is app and its features. Notification gives problem mostly. If that is not concern its good. If by mistake u switch of watch it can again be powered after connecting to charger only. I treat this a design flaw. Should be able to power on it remotely also(without charger).,4
This headphone is amazing.... You have to buy this and IDK about other phones but for Samsung J6 & OPPO it works really well,4
Good one!,4
Print quality is good but bit noisey one.,4
"Works perfectly for a small 3 room apartment. Signal stay strong even a floor below. Using 1 Mbps connection, use Netflix and Amazon without any issues.",4

But the wifi range is 15-30 meters without walls consider it before buying.

Thanks,
D.R.Ramkumar.",4
Good one for motivated,4
First time I'm buy the smart band ...... I like it,4
It's a very good product with minimum bezels and a 1080p brightness intelligent display. The low blue light mode works really fine. The User interface of the screen is obsolete. Don't expect built-in speakers to deliver an output of even 1W.,4
"I wanted a range extender along with router but it didn't work so,😰",4
"It is Awesome watch with BP check, Heart rate monitor and SPO2. It has long life battery with attractive skins.",4
Easy to setup and use!,4
Very good product it has a good quality battery and many more things . Very good camera must buy if you have a 15000 price range.,4
"obviously Better than Mi Band 3 . can't say If it's Better than other smart Bands.
Overall performance is satisfactory, It does the Job. Battery performance is as good as Advertised!",4
It backups for some time but time vary from 1 hour to 3 hours.,4
Works perfectly with MTNL DSL Broadband and has a decent range if you do not have too many walls,4
"The headphones is very in terms of sound quality and also it produces a decent bass and it balances all the sounds perfectly , if you want to buy a good headphones for budget price go for it , keep it up boat",4
Product is very nice but I have some time connetivity issue & the screen size is too short.,4
It's smooth in working,4
"When play PUBG on Xiaomi phone audio cuts off for 15seconds. Sound quality is good, it's not fold able so not easy to carry.

I have a linux PC and it get connected in two times but then works good",4
"Good sound quality. Design of the headphone, Build quality is superb. Battery life amazing. budget headphone.",4

Very good product ☺️😊,4
"Sound quality grt
Noise cancellation pathetic",4
"AWESOME PRODUCT..strap is very comfortable, can wear all day long",4
It's good sound quality ND on time delivery,4
Sound quality so nice.,4
Touch screen has poor response after some time.... Battery last less than a week if all features are put to use. MI band 5 is just OK,4
"Battery backup is gud.
Even though the display is only 720p...it looks gud
Faceunlock works like a charm
There is no finger print unlock....but is not a big deal for me
Mi is known for its bloatware....needed little tinkering there..
Camera- it is the worst compared to other mobile camera i have used...
Overall good phone...for lite to moderate users",4
Fingerprint sensor not available.battery and camera qlity Normal .I am not proper use after used full review. Why full review not permitted .,4
"The main highlights what I like are:
1. The Boat Bassheads 100 is very affordable.
2. The headset comes in a variety of colours
3. Sound quality is decent enough for the price.
Although plastic, the casings do look nice thanks to their unique design.Don't let the price of the Boat Bassheads 100 have you think you're getting a sub-par product; this pair of earphones does a decent job. The sound is loud, and the sonic signature suits most popular music genres with slightly elevated responses in the lows and highs. With the volume low, the sound was devoid of any excitement, but pumping the level up to around 80 percent immediately improved sound quality.",4
"balanced sound with good bass
build quality is ok
music playtime is almost 10 hrs
bluetooth connectivity is good",4
Really very nice n value for money,4
Suppb sound,4
Awesome quality,4
"Probably a bit of old fashioned model. Print quality is good but takes time to print. Main problem is, the print is 'windows only'. All efforts were gone in vain to make the printer linux friendly! You can use android though.",4
I Like .,4
"Product is good , very useful features, temperature, spo2 , bp etc. Works like a charm, looks great on hand . Only thing is battery backup which is on par with most products in this range but could be better if had 30-40 days battery backup. Got three straps with this, different colours, which was a nice surprise!! Sleep tracking seems correct, touchscreen and ui is great.",4
Good Deal on A Dell Original Battery.Good price for dell original battery. Easy to install and quick to charge. This is a replacement for the Dell Vostro A840 laptop. Happy with the purchase and the price,4
"Nice band. Good felling and build quality. Nice and bright display. Great overall experience 🙂. The sleep tracking is over 80 per. accurate,the mi fit app is great with a friendly interface and easy to use.But the heart tracking can still be improved and I expected SPo2 feature tooo.
. Good battery backup and nice variety of wallpapers.Best band at this price range.

Edit- after 15 days my display cracked and mi do not cover this in warranty..... Nor they have a spare screen of the band... Sooo sad :( 😭😭..... I have shared the photo also.....",4
Good product. At times sleep tracker n step counter show incorrect reading.,4
Easy to use & installation but WiFi Range strength is not much strong,4
The product is awesome at this price with neckband and bass is also good. It allows little noise cancellation which keeps us informed about our surrounding and even provide a soothing sound. The ear buds fits perfectly hence can easily be used during workout.,4
good router but doesn't suit for for my internet connection (Beam(Hyderabad) So I had To Return It.Excellent Packaging By AMAZON.,4
Print quality is midium..tech support is worst..and easy to install,4
Good produt by fireboltt,4
Awesome phone is a little slow camera could be much better,4
Allover good,4
"I got the monitor for my office work and the display is pretty crisp.. it also loads content extremely fast as soon as connected to laptop via HDMI cable
The inbuilt cable management system is a boon to avoid messing /tangling of cables.
The only downside so far are the built in speakers which are not at all loud even at high volume.",4
Works well with phone. But doesn't work well with laptop. However it is worth of money.,4
I am using this watch from last one week overall it's good but sleep tracking it's not functioning well even distance it's not good and have to sync my watch every hour i dont know why ?,4
"Product is very good! It passed all the audio test. The bass effect is pretty much what I enjoyed.
A little disappointment because the earphones were not good for singing and there was a little latency when you sung in the microphone and hear your voice at other side of the end. But overall it's good if u just want something that produces bass and enhances your music experience.",4
"while thinking of buying an earpiece.
then go this worth buying.
I purchased at a discounted rate but feel worthy after having them.",4
great,4
Simple and very easy to use,4
The product looks awesome and easy to set up.. works good even when several devices connected. Interface is also nice but it is better only for home use due the strength of range.,4
"Product is good, easy to use, but one drawback is that while using ftp server the ip address changes everytime when the powers goes off. It leads to issue in browsing the ftp server remotely. It might the the way it works but if it can be fix to a definit id it will be far better for user.",4
good for running cycling but while swimming HR manager is not working.. apart from that this will be good one.. but cost wise not ok,4
Really good camera for photography learner,4
Yes I like the product. Looks very nice. Wi fi signal is very good.overall this product is satisfactory. Thanks TP-LINK,4
I Recently Bought this Monitor for RS 8400.This monitor is really nice.The colors are absolutely amazing.Refreshing Rate is to good.The only -ve point of this monitor is its stand.It is not upto the mark.Screen shakes while i m typing.or there is amall disturbance to the table.this is the only thing that i dont like otherwise all other thing are good.i could have given it 5 stars if the stand has been solid.otherwise on al othe points the LED is upto the mark and is too good.i like it,4
Product is awesome...though it hurts on putting the headphones on for long time *Without listening at high volumes.. The headphone is tight and feels a bit problematic to wear continuously..,4
Good network,4
"No fingerprint, battery life is very good",4
"2.4G range is lower than MI’s router, could have been better.",4

"Great value for money, bandwidth is good and signals are ok for the money",4
"Thank you Amazon for fast and one day before delivery.
Sound quality is good, noise cancellation is average, bluetooth connectivity is excellent. Good battery backup, light weight and cool design.",4
Guys this product is crazy at a unbelievable price I gonna tell sound quality and bass is outstanding but they are not comfortable fitting in my ear so it's good for small or medium eard,4
"Very good product, it allows to have both 5g and 2.4 under one name so easy to switch for the devices , only draw back is it does not have IST time zone to set time, when we do the time manually it gets reset to something else after reboot hence i am giving 4star, Please include IST timezone into the next firmware update , after moving to this router the voice quality over zoom and teams, whatsapp got improved, while streaming 4k movies on tv , kids can continue with their meeting over zoom and teams. no buffering at all.",4
Good product but little expensive. Regular pc ups cost almost same and can connect more devices.,4
Long time usage hurts your ears by pressing,4
Battery life is awesome. Camera quality is nice in this range.But finger reader is not present😶,4
"initially I bought TP Link W8968 for my Airtel Broadband Connection but this was getting disconnected every 5 mins. After this I ordered D-Link 2750U, and this product is working perfectly with Airtel Connection. Installation process is also very simple and just you need to plug and make an entry of your ISP settings and you are good to GO.moreover the range is also good
This model is recommendable over TP Link",4
"Except WiFi connection to printer, overall is good.",4
"Head phone is decent. Features are good. Still, I would not have brought, if I had known the country of origin, which was not mentioned. The product is made in China. When I tried to return, the option had changed as replacement and surely, I did not want to tax the supplier. Request to all vendors selling in Amazon to kindly include the country of manufacture, so that it will be easy for customers to decide the purchase.",4
"Comfortable ,sound quality is bit poor than expected otherwise it's perfect for noise cancellation and with great quality",4

I brought this product in jan 2016. Its going to be two years now there is no fault still works fine. Nice product.,4
"Good
But not fully satisfied",4
"The product was so good
Friendly use
With good features 👌",4
"Build quality and looks wise it feels premiùm. Lasts for upto 4days easily with cont HR monitoring turned on. But, the app lags a lot, the watch is also not that responsive and lags a bit. The connection with phone not that stable. often fail to show any of the notifications of the phone even when its connected via bluetooth. Ray of hope is that most of these issues can be fixed with a software update, if the company feels like making the effort",4
Good products at this price,4
This product is so small isle Carrey is another place,4
"It is a good product , but when it comes to attend a call and answer it from this headphone , i found it difficult as the other person is not able to hear my voice from my side and i am also not able to answer the other person. I have to answer loudly , so if you are in a public place , you have to answer the call after disconnecting it from your device.",4
"One of the best router I have used till now
Pros
Excellent speed
No network issues
Easy to install
Budget friendly

Cons
Nothing till now",4

"Nice product. Works well ,",4
Super... Valuable for money ☺☺☺,4
Good product for Amazon .Timely delivery.good looking,4
"Superb router Easy to configure
Works with BSNL MTNL triband
Go for it",4
"Overall good purchase...serves the basic purpose of having a smart watch...
Can read messages and get call notification as well ...
Quite satisfied...
Touch screen is not that sensitive, but not that bad either...",4
"Amazing sound quality. Just simply amazing. Also comfortable and fits perfectly in the ear. But the wire and the joints aren't durable. After about 7 months the left earpiece's sound reduced by 40% but then again after about a month the right earpiece's sound reduced by 70%.
It still works tho but the sound has really reduced.",4
"Wonderful product
Got WiFi signal strength
Easy to setup",4
"Good inktank printer with free 2 bottles of black ink, sure it will save a lots of money we usually spend on buying costly ink cartridges and low yield of cheap printers. After one year both printers will cost same to you. So go for it, saves a lots of money in long run.",4
"Good product for the price. Found sleep record little off mark in 3 days I used. The product needs to be in 2 sizes, current one is more of feminine and small in size for men's wrist. Amazing product and app otherwise",4
"Yaa this is a good router for this price
Range is also nice
The only disadvantage is u don't have on off button on router ... But this doesn't make any difference
Very gud router at this rate I recommend u to buy this 😊",4
The overall system is average.... Sounds and bass are also average.... Bt the delivery system are poor... The men who deliver this to me this morning are so careless.... The stored this system very carelessly.. As a result the remote broke up..... Bt not fully damaged its working after I install batteries in this.... One more drawback is that they don't provide battery for the remote... Other wise it's good under this range.... Better than expected.... I was very confused to buy music system.... After many research I found this one.. Hopping will fulfill the expectations... And it does...... If you are also willing to have a home theatre under 2.5k... You can go with it... Surely it will stand on your expectations.... Bt the delivery men should be careful....... Thnks,4
"Reviewing after using daily for one month, good sound quality, excellent bass, noise cancellation needs to be improved, and the design tends break the head set easily. But compared to contemporaries it will be at top.",4
"The watch is sleek, compact and stylish. Features are as mentioned. Accuracy is something am still exploring. I bought it for my wife and she is happy with the product. Touch screen is good and battery life is yet to be seen.",4
I like that's phone.,4

"Very good mobile with this budget.running well, battery backup is very good ,Low budget very good phone.",4
The router which I ordered from amazon was working good with 2.4ghz but 5ghz range was only one foot so I replaced it and amazon gave me new router whose 5ghz mode is working fine. Must be some defect in the previous router but thanx amazon for replacing ☺️☺️,4
Good phone but camera averages,4
"Best router as per price has all premium features found in costly routers like MIMO, Smart Connect, Airtime Fairness and best part is it had 600mbps 2.4ghz single band network so speed is around 110mbps in single band connection itself. Normal router with 300mbps achieve only 40mbps speed.

Signal strength is better than average but not very strong.

Only missing is app support like tplink tether app.

Built quality could have been better and only 2 lan ports",4
"Its sounds good , bass is good overall good,light weight earphone with less surrounding disturbance.comes with earbuds 4 pieces.A warranty letter,its long wire compared to boat earphones.Tested the mic too not much as the earphones bt overall ok.",4

"Cool product, very easy to use for all age group. All features are very handy. BP reading accuracy needs improvement. Best is Service team response time, excellent when in need.",4
"Unlike the description, bass is not punchy. However, I just wanted an wired earphone with mic to attend virtual meetings as the one I have is without mic. I prefer wired earphones as my past experiences has shown that the one without mic works longer than the one with mic. Sound quality is decent for the price range. You will be quite satisfied with the results, just don't expect them to sound like a 5K earphone.",4
Good quality at this price.,4
"advantage
battery life, processor, latest OS, look

disadvantage

"I was very confused for buying s21 ultra because I have heared and see many reviews saying that phone heats a lot.But when I purchased it and used it.
Here is my experience
1.Phone never heats on minimal usages and even on some heavy task.I ran geekench 2 time and phone got very minimal heat.
Yes it heats when you capture photos and videos for while but quickly cools down.So it heat is kind of negotiable.The phone is super fast.The phone got really hot around 40°c when I updated it to march security patch.Very happy with this",4
"Durable product but your ear feel uncomfortable when used for longer time, anyhow its common problem with all other headphones when u use them for longer time.",4

"Specifications mentioned on the product page are correct.
Pros: (total 10 points)
1. IPS panel with 27 inch screen and FHD resolution. (+2 points)
2. No flaws in external hardware design, round corners, even level surface mat finish (yes i do check these things) (+2 points)
3. Multiple connectivity with vertical access (means connection ports parallels to screen) and Wall mount options available. (+2 Points)
4. Anti Glare coating, No dead pixel, Great color depth and contrast ratio, average thin Bessel, good response time. (+2 Points)
5. Cable management provided in table mount and separate button at bottom for screen config. (+2 points)
6. it has in-built speaker, expect only to play smooth music. (+1/2 point not considering in monitor category)
Cons: (total -5 points)
1. they provided auto bright adjust sensor in front side (mid bottom) but for me it was annoying for two reason. (-2 Points)
a. its not upto the mark.
b. i missed basic elegant rectangle design look (i would suggest to make it detachable)
2. external Power light at bottom right corner but since its not on front side and not a hard light and can be compensated by keeping dark object beneath it (-1 point)
3. Manual color and screen mode adjustment required to suit your viewing distance and content. Presets were not that helpful. (-2 point)

Overall (+5 points), Product Quality and offerings are really good and worth the price.
Thanks to Seller and Amazon for great delivery experience..",4

"1. The response time for screen turning on on wrist turn is slow.

Value for money just go for it",4
"1st day experience. Info page showing fail status and wifi password cannot be retrieved. Lines appearing in prints and not solve even after head cleaning twice and waste lots of costly original ink. Printing stops in middle and paper has to pulled manually. Though to replace the printer and Amazon told to contact epson. Epson once disconnected my call saying techical problem. After called them they gave complain number. This printer was not in my budget still somehow managed it and this happening. Very important exam after 3 days. Now should i study or stress my head this box which epson calls printer. Aaa thuu. Will amazon or epson compensate for the lost ink or my precious time or my cool of mind to study.

Update after 16 days usage.
Printer is good. Print quality is good. Fast. No auto duplex is sad. Ink is costly.
Advice: no screen so, installation was difficult. Better call technician for installtion. Will update later if any problem found",4
For the price it's good... But the detection is very basic..... Very much variable on the accuracy... But... If u r going for a smart band for first time and just started excersizing and recording health habits this is an entry level band... But if u have been a pro in keeping yourself healthy and doing it since an yr or two this is a low level product.... But for beginners it's perfect instead of going for a pricy smart band unless u know u gonna use it and get the feel for a smart band....... I give it a solid 7/10,4
"Nice on ear phone from Boat.

"Nice build quality with premium looking material. Quite sturdy design. Sound quality is also good for this price range. It works almost with every device like mobile, laptop, firetv.

The only con I came across was the mic. But I will update my review once I thoroughly test this for more couple of days to find out exactly what's wrong with the mic.",4
Good quality product.,4
Sensor is slow and watchfaces are not good,4
Sound quality rivals some flagship headphones. Adding to that is the great and interactive customer support. This is a great product to buy and own. It's also not bulky when worn as compared to many other headphones in the price range. Overall a good one!,4

Every thing is Good
5.1 splitting not up to the mark but ok
Only one thing i won't like this product its ""Made In China""🥺🥺. I expected as Made in Japan",4
Boat provides us with the best products at a reasonable rate. I bought them just for my evening walks but now i think I'm gonna switch to them. Only flaw is that the cushions are not much comfortable. I was confused between these and Skullcandy anti headphones. But i ended up buying them because of the microphone. I don't think this isn't worth it.,4
"This pair of earphones is just what I was looking for. I use them at home during bedtime, meaning there are many times I snag the cables and twine them in my sleep. However, this pair didn't give up on me yet.

Sound quality is average but clear enough. You get just one button for play/ pause OR Answer/ Reject Call. No volume control buttons on this wired in ear earphone. They sure are value for money!

Please share your opinions and reviews so that customers can make informed purchases. Use the tag #AGB for Amazon Genuine Buyer",4
Speakers are very long enough to be kept at distance. Clear music and sound. It has Bluetooth connection mode also.,4
Low quality and butter life,4
Good functional product. Mainly bought this thinking it will not hurt ears for long calls and the design and shape just takes care of this. Only problem is the rubber beeds come off. Spares provided are of not same colour,4
"The watch looks premium. It has nice collection of watch faces. Battery backup and screen brightness is also good. Thr magnetic charger makes the charging hassleless

Continues BP tracking and accuracy improvement should be made available and it will be true gem. Many Indians have BP issue this can be a life saver if improvements are made.

The BP is not accurate when compared with the Medical one. The watchface is lost if the battery drain out completely.",4
Battery life is awesome but camera quality is not up to the mark. Rest all is gud.,4
"After using for 20 days, i am here to write a review. This product is well packed and user manual is good. You cant connect with your smartphone directly with bluetooth. You need to download noisefit app for that and need to connect your watch. Connectivity is good. Fraction of seconds delay on notification. Display is good, feel is good. Looks is very good. SNS, like whats app, msg, facebook and other app notification you can see only. You can see the first line of each notification, but cant enter into the msg. To read the msg you need to use your phone(unless the msg is one liner).
Heart rate monitor is closely correct. Step count is good. Sports mode is great. Real count of a cumulative of 3 steps. Alarm works well. Truly water proof(follow the IP68 standard). Dont use in salt water, it can damage.
My usage is very high and still i get 4 days battery back up. Its pretty good.

According to the cost of the product, you cant expect more than that. Its recommended to use this product.",4

This is third HP printer that I have purchased. I had HP deskjet 1050. Only Rollers create problems may be due to more wear and tare. But company may take care of quality. Second big hurdle is the refill problem. Cartridge too small and costly and suddenly exhausted. In emergency unavailable immediately. Working hampers as nobody can count pages printed. Otherwise printer is awe sum.,4
I prefer the wore ones as blue tooth gives me head aches,4
Nice watch in a affordable price,4
nice...,4
The camera is great for beginners who have just stated to learn but the features are slightly complex for understanding. If you have ever used a Nikon camera..I would suggest you buy Nikon because the transition can be little uneasy. But the camera in itself is very good.

Not much to review. As usual good product from D-Link. Previously used 150 which was also good. Simply go for it.,4
"The watch is great in terms of features and everything But the battery backup is really bad. I tend to do workout twice a day with walking and weight lifting and to keep a track on it, I usually switch on the activities. With all these turned on, I get approximately 3-4 days of battery backup which is really very less. So if battery backup is not a deal breaker for you, then it's good to go.",4

Very good product and finding very easy to stay connected on internet without having those wires. The speed is as good as LAN cable connection that is very good point.,4
"It is a good laptop, but setimes it got stuck for about 2-3 mins bit that's not a major thing. If you'll disable low power mode. It will work fine because in low power mode it extends the battery and reduces the performance, So, if you do multitasking . First charge it to about 80-90% then disable low power mode, and then use it. Rest, It's a excellent laptop many good features, and the booting is blazing fast.",4

The product was good but the remote was broken in battery hump i thought it was due to shipping i guess other all the product was awesome,4
"Material quality is good but I can't say anything about it's durability. I feel that if you handle it carefully then it's good but if you just roughly use it then may be you broke the headphone from speaker folding side. Sound quality is good at this prizepoint don't expect to much. Although, I receive some day defective product as because right side of speaker is noisy. Some unnecessary noise comes from right side of speaker. I requested to Amazon for replacement hopefully it'll replaced by good product nor defective one.",4

Good product at this price..,4
Worth Buying quality is Good and I bought @1499 but after I bought Netgear N150 (2 less ethernet port) from flipkart for my home @799. compare with both I would suggest Netgear,4
I don't see the real benefit even after having four antennas..the range is just similar to the router with dual antennas. The only benefit seen is on the dual signals,4
its parfecty osome,4

"After using it for 10 days here is my review

1) Battery life 8 days max
2) Heart rate sensor- works well most of the time
3) So many customization options available in Mifit app and other feature like incoming call alter.

1) Battery life is 8 days. Xiomi should send OTA update to improve it. Its 60% of what Xiomi is claiming.
2)No dark mode",4

Other wise the product is great . The battery life is just 3-4 days that I got.",4
"I was a bit sceptic at first but after using it, I have no qualms. Fyi, I got this product at around 800 bucks, so I am quite happy with the performance. Decent enough sound, not like the BOAT ones but will provide an overall balance of sound quality.",4

Camera Quality Low,4
Look and alerts,4
"Simply speaking as a Budget phone. If you are looking for a good back camera and good battery life then this phone is for u.
Pros
1- Good battery life. Rough users who play games might get 12-14 hours of battery back up
2- Back cam 48 mp catches the picture perfectly
3- Quite smooth and handful in use.
4- Budget Buy

Cons
1- 8 mp selfie cam and Night photos (If you are selfieholic and loves to click selfie then definitely this phone is not recommend one)
2- Video Calling (Wifi video calling and the caller screen is disappointed one.",4
Product is Good but we can't connect TV Audio only DVD player is working,4
"Monitor is good, nice picture and colour however there is no tilt. Not a fan of the joy stick to change menu settings. Its a bit awkward to use. But once set no worries. The power button should have been a stand alone button and not interconnrcted with the menu settings joystick. The arc stand is quite sturdy, monitor stays steady. Got it at a good price. Delivery was good, well packaged, recieved brand new product. If it wasn't for the joy stick and power button I would have given it a 5.",4
"It's a good product, but Mi Router is better and cheaper. I Came to know about Mi Router one day later, but I had placed order. Still not very sorry for missed opportunity as this is also good and providing adequate services.",4

"Print quality is much better than my old printer(canon).low cost printing,easy to refill.A good printer for this price .
I liked this printer
Continuous printing more than 15 minutes makes some troubles.",4
"Sleek design with very good quality. However I personally did not like the quality and positioning of the music controlling buttons as three buttons are available for functions like Power ON & Off, Volume control and track control. So you have to hold buttons for different functioning.
Otherwise everything is up to the mark",4
"Excellent value for the price.
So the laptop arrived after 3 days and was inside 3 boxes. Coming to the review:
8GB ram is a bit less, should definitely upgrade to 16GB. However, it has warranty sticker om top of one of the screws, so I don't know if you can upgrade it yourself. Acer service center will charge you 8k for the ram upgrade (P.S. - I personally went there and checked).
Coming to the laptop the hinges of the laptop rotate 180°, but are on the lose side if you compare it with other laptops.
The audio quality is pathetic, will recommend to use a Bluetooth speaker or headphones for better audio quality.
Apart from this, performance is top notch, it does get noticeably hot while gaming, an external fan is required for keeping thermals low.
Overall if you ignore a few things here and there a great value for the price you are paying.",4
"The experience with this boat earphone is very good the in-built quality is wonderful.
But I personally was not satisfied with the material used . But overall it's a great product to buy. The packaging was not that great there were cramps all over the box .

It lacks fingerprint scanner. Camera quality is not so good. It is a very heavy phone, difficult to keep itnin hands id you are using it for long while lying in bed. But it is worth buying.

It has made in india sticker also, not sure if it is real.",4

But two big cons -
1. Horrible MIC, it captures all apart from your own voice. Definitely not suggested if you want to take your calls on this headphone mic
2. A bit bulky, so it is not that comfortable wearing for more than 2 hours.",4
boat basshead 100.Good product but expensive,4
"This is a must have for your daily wfh needs. During power disruption, the device does not let the WiFi signal go off. The only downside is the battery backup and the amount of time it takes to charge up.",4

"It is the best band for its price range and features , its definitely worth buying . It has many major improvements over the previous bands and for ₹2.3k its a good buy
Pros:
1.Color amoled display and has tons of customizability , custom watch faces (like my pip boy custom watch face) and 3rd party app support (some can even display google maps directions on the band).
2.can control media and volume (including videos)
3.has varying brightness options
4.alarms set through the app can be toggled on the band itself
5.can check weather for multiple days and also check upto 10 notifications
6.has a separate exercise mode for weightlifting
Cons:
1.strap although it fits snug , it is a bit on the tighter side and is mildly uncomfortable(could leave marks on the skin)
2.cannot switch to the music screen while on an active workout mode
3.Find device option doesn't ring on the phone speakers if headphones are connected to the phone
4.the packaging isnt as premium as mi band 2 and mi band 3",4
"N300 router with dual antenna for half the price of competitive brands made this the best choice..
Offering 300mbps speed on ethernet and around 35mbps on wifi for file transfer.
Sadly offering only 3.4 MBps speed on file downloads over internet although connection speed is 50mbps old N150 use to give 1.3mbps so still a noticeable bump.
The range is fair enough to cover every corner of our 1300sqft apartment. May offer little more if operating open doors.
Overall a bang for buck router",4
Mobile software is fine..... But need calling function via watch,4

Paper cross feeding happened and scanner also not good.,4
Sound is lovely with good bass,4
The answers to the question whether it’s made in India is NO. It's not made in India. It’s clearly stated on the package that it’s made in China. Some people have written that it’s made in India which misleading.,4
It is good product!?,4
"my first pair of these jbl worked over a year, never have any other earphones lasted that long ( i use them pretty much all the time)

"It's a powerhouse. Amazing bass, music quality is very good. A lot of options to connect with everything. I'm mainly using it through Bluetooth and connected with my TV. But FM is useless and there is no display, which station is playing. Basically it is missing multi information display. That's the only negative point. I'm using it as s sound bar but love the option that it can also be converted into 2 speakers. Also on the main console the circular volume button is really cool. Remote does what's expected. Overall really good product. Packaging was not great as they just polywrapped the box and there was no outer amazon box what you generally get. Delivery was fast.",4
good product.worth for the money,4
The look is very good just like higher end and very reasonable prise.,4
"Works well, setup is fairly simple using the CD supplied, though getting through to the ISP proved the toughest part. Good to involve the ISP in the set up though. Find that the internet connectivity at home is better with this device than with our previous beetel old router. On the whole, good product, we are happy.",4
This watch is excellent for the price. The accuracy of Spo2 & heart rate is almost 100%. The BP accuracy is almost 95%. All the exercise mode is also perfect. Go for it....!,4
Phone all features are good at this price but phone too hot..in some time using,4
Installation is like plug and play..built quality can be better.range is ok.not recommend for big house. Good product for the price.,4
Very Nice product...😊😊😊,4
Everything is good in this earphones but two things missing in the earphones is durability and the fitting in the ear. other than that if you have small ears and if you handle things really well means just go for it. one of the best brand in the platform.,4

If you want printer and save ,I definitely recommend it .
Great printer with good scanner
Good print quality.
Easy to setup for usb
Hogh speed printer which can print 14 pages per minute black and 9 pages per minute for colors
Cons
Wifi setup is hard
Great printer of setuup done by canon service center",4
This MI smart band is really cool..... except it is not showing accurate measurements for heart rates and sleep tracker as well..... but the rest features are bang on.,4
"Sound that comes from this earphones is good.
It's not super bass heavy, but gets the job done.
Got a defective earphones but was easily replaced by amazon.
The cable is a bit thin and might get damaged. hope jbl gives a braided cable in the future",4
Sound Quality Is Awesome In These Price But bill is not Recived,4
This product was priced lesser than local retailers we enquired. The product is good and running without any problem and I would recommend it to my friends.,4
Good but so lag in its battery life 4 hour,4
It really covers a good network area across the house cutting both the ground and first floor with farthest distance of 1100+sq feet..good signal coverage,4
"Bought for summer sale 599
Bass lovers will be fan for it
Amazing sound u will love it
Cons
Length of cable short and delicate",4
This is really cool to install and works well. Just the Wifi signal strength and speed in a more distant room of the house becomes very poor. Signal reach is not too good to all corners of the house,4
"nice product

it fullfils my neeed

Amazon is great in delivery like this product",4
"Best product in this price range and has good features inckuding SpO2 measurement. Comes with a amoled display which is a plus considering the price. Tracking seemed alright, nothing to complain about!",4

good built quality
its a v1 model so 5dbi antennas
how ever amazon packaging was not upto the mark",4
"This is my first experience with wireless earphones. Experience is great using these. Only one issue i felt with this - the volume up and down gesture should not have been single touch but slider or quick touches...it takes time to turn volume up and down using slow single touch...

Rest this item is good..
Sound quality is 5/5
Noise cancellation 4/5
Bass 4/5",4

Working fine..,4

Kind of satisfactory smart watch with good battery backup with this price. You can go ahead and try to have one,4
excellent product.,4
"I like the built quality and the battery backup, i bought this product for my fitness purpose and it's working fine",4
"It's good if we see it as basic/semi advanced router. Overall 6-7 pts out of 10. Looking at the cost, it's very good.
5 GHz coverage is very short, should have been better. 2.4 Ghz is decent. Wifi schedule is cool feature. Gig ports do justice. 4 external antenas (should have been replaceable). Sleek design.
Booting takes long time. Got V3.2. Sleek but I will ask TPLink for better design in terms of status lights size, position and visibility. If we plan to wall mount this model then almost no chance to get view of status lights. Coming to features, though list of options shows multiple advanced areas, they are much controlled by the firmware for effective configuration/utilization. like QoS....
Even a very basic router is having individual device bandwidth control option but this doesn't have. Not sure what challenge TPLink is having in providing such things in one go. I hope the hardware is capable and in coming updates TPLink provides full feature set utilization options considering the customer requests.",4
Well product & quality also. But one side stop working within 1 year. Bad customer service experience from JBL harman.,4
very good for home use and small office,4
There is some loss of data packets between the main router Nd this one.,4
Good product.Good product,4
Delivery was on time. Good packaging. Product is good. Setup was easy. Everything is working.,4
Good print quality but cartridge price is too high.,4
Good one. Better than mi band 4. But battery backup is less than band 4. Easily compatible with any device and is light weight. Count steps when you are driving also. Call alert notifications are fine. Works well. I was using band 4 from last two and half years and now ordered band 5 for my mother. Both works well. Worth buying.,4
I was loving them for he price I bought them and I one day my brother took it and gave it to some one for a day . This guy never returned me back. Most probably that idiot loved the product too .,4
"product worked excellent .but since it is an adsl router it worked excellent for BSNL internet, but later on i switched to other service providers who required a WAN router then i was required to purchase a new one. i tried to update this router's firmware with the middle eastern firmware which had the option for the WAN + ADSL connectivity but the hardware doesnt support. make sure you see these things when u buy these.

otherwise the product works excellently well and early delivery fom AMAZON!!!",4

"Great product. Chose 1 day delivery but was delivered late. Totally not cool of Amazon.
The product itself is awesome. There's been an incredible boost in signal and range. Earlier I barely used to get signals at the end of my house from where my other router was (about 35 feet with 3 walls in between) and now I have signals till at least a 50 feet from my house, from the exact same place I use to place my other router.
The additional settings provided on the router page are really helpful of you want to set up port forwarding, firewalls, ACLs etc.
Totally worth the money",4

Sound quality is great but build quality can be improved ... So far it's a great deal for what you pay.,4

Old review:
Every 8 or 10 seconds the data transfer stops for few seconds. due to this online class and meetings having issue bcos of this. No issue in old single band router and online classes works fine even in mobile tethering also. Monitored this for 2 days. Not sure if this is issue in this model itself. Pls share ur experience",4

As a whole within this budget well product for family members.",4
Better for use and battery but low storage,4
"Blutooth is good.
Sound quality is best.
Bass is enough.

But...
I have given 4 stars because the length of rear speakers(rear left & rear right) wires are not sufficient as both has 20feet lengths respectively.

If it is 15metres length, it will be enough to use this best sound system in (hall)Living room...

Because cutting speakers wire and extension is not adviceable as sound quality may decrease Or life of the sound system may decrease...
If all wires are lengthy, they can be easily Concealed in walls...

Best product in 15k rate...",4
I am satisfied with this product. People can go for it. It has good sound and bass.,4
"Very nice watch and realiable. Happy to use this.
Tracks sleep and calories very well and battery life is decent.",4

"In fact to have some basic surveillance this camera will be suitable. The coverage of area is decent but clarity of human faces or vehicle number plates cannot be viewed using it.
Alarm function is good. Night vision mode is also quite good.
We must have a strong wifi connection for the cam to operate at its optimal level.
To speak about the application the download of videos from or through the app is not possible still this application serves its purpose for what it is meant for.
Above all at this price it's a decent cam which can be relied upon",4
It's ok.product,4
Yea good phone I had a note 8 pro and this is a good phone also,4
"This product is really good, works well and I love the strong connectivity",4

Need to improve Wi-Fi signal quality. Rest all is working properly for more than 1 year.,4
"A good product , overall accuracy is good but the BP measurement maybe slight varying(needs a fix)
The entire ecosystem of GOQii is promising , fitness experts , doctors etc... helps to have everything in one place.
Is an alternative to the expensive Apple Watch or other wearables.
Battery lasts for about 3-4 days with each full charge.
Worth buying for a price of 3500-4500 k if u have discounts etc.",4
"Product arrived with Headset, Audio and Charging cable. Tested with and without Bluetooth.
Calls are very clear. Music is very good with decent Bass.
Product arrived early than expected.

Too good.Now satisfied with the product... its a lifetime transcend DDR2 RAM 2 gb perfect,4
Bass quality and sound effects are very good and the only problem is it'll make your ear painful after using it for long time.,4
Worth product in this price range. Good quality Stap.... Bright display... Esay to use... Would be more eye catchy if display screen is large,4

"Good ear phones with a low price. Sound quality is good, noise cancellation is also good enough and bass is nice. Sound is clear. Only down point is the plastic build and the regular cable (no flat cable). Over experience is good and value for money",4
Its good buy.Happy with this product can access BSNL broadband using this from every corner of my house in the ground floor or in the roof it is working fine.I can access internet via mobile or laptop. Also it is secured by encryption. But it is heated after 1 hour of continuous usage I think it is natural. So Overall good experience.,4
"HONEST REVIEW
what do I like about this monitor?
The split-screen function is awesome, audio output for speakers, matt finish screen, display quality is awesome, best in the budget, best in 22 inches without thinking twice.

The only net picking is the monitor does not tilt. so you need to use an aftermarket stand for it.
9/10 for this monitor.

NOTE- PLEASE ALWAYS SEE MANUFACTURING DATE OF PRODUCT, DON'T DECIDE JUST BY NUMBER OF REVIEWS",4
Best among this series👍👍👍,4
Good quality smart fitness watch in budget. SPO2 &temp MTR feature will make it more demanding. Magenetic charging base makes it more safe. Have all other functions which normally fitness band has in this budget. Good to have this product.,4
Well I am impressed with the product at this cost. Such a great base and sound quality. Only one problem so far i have faced is my ears starts paining after using long time say 1/2 hr.,4
Time,4
"There's no Earphones with Product ??
How ridiculous !!",4
"2 days before I purchase this product from croma on Rs.14250/-
Sound quality good no doubt but Volume level is very low u can't hear on 15 20 minimum sounds cum up on 25 and 30 majaor Subwoofer sound is less compare to other products. This is what I felt but in this budget is nice deal. 👍",4
"Vibrative Alarm( setting through phone but not directly), Physical fitness tracker (Running, Walking, Cycling etc), Herat rate, Music and Voice call Control (can be declined but not answered), Accurate Time, Breathing exercise, Timer and Stopwatch, Easly connected to phone but phone battery drains, Watch charge lasting for more than week.",4

I want to cancel the item. I don't want right now..i will purchase it later,4
Ok Ok,4
"Overall good one only bad is ear cup size, you will feel painin ur ears after 20 minutes",4
It's working fine till today -takes some time to get operational,4
Doesn't provide much noise cancellation and not suitable for long hours use. Design wise it is good and convenient for calling too.,4
I saw the Heart beat and cycling measures wrong data. Walking and sleep moniter works good.i haven't tried other workout modes.,4
Good for this price. Wire doesn't entangle when kept in pocket,4
"Value for money sound quality is best rich bass and good treble, mic quality is not much good,",4
Good picture quality for gaming and work. Doesn't have a usb port though,4
Low volume,4
It's good but app should be more interactive,4
Go for it...looks cool n works great❤,4
Earphones are of Good quality..Not that much sounds good as compared to other JBL products...10 out of 7....bass is quite good...needs to press earbuds inside the ear to hear clear bass sound...cable wire is very much thin so need to take care of that also need to handle properly to avoid damage...But if your getting JBL product in 450-500 rs range then go for it...Delivery and packing was all good...,4
Really nice product...,4
WiFi is not available but they says WiFi is available,4

"Good product, Good working sleep tracking and touch screen, but app is not connecting",4
"Good product for this price .large display,battery is good,but no finger print",4
"I am using this router as an extender for my router i.e a JIO router. Router is pretty great which is extending the signal pretty good also attaining speed close to the parent router.
Only con is I am facing issue with connection stability sometimes otherwise the router serves its purpose.",4
The phone is suitable for normal users. Camera quality is not upto the mark. Battery life is good. Not a gaming mobile,4

Touch screen is also good
Best accuracy",4
"The sound quality is really good and you can even use it for really long time, but the mic sometime creates distroted sound on other side.",4

Very good good product and app is very good.,4
"This product is good. The sturdiness is wonderful.
Good to use cameras (DSLR) with not so heavy lenses. The pod can bear the weight but your hands will start shaking. Using GOPRO will be a cake walk and fun.

network component no network droppings,4
Good and nice product,4
Superb like it with budget,4
Superb.... this is my first band..,4
Well every thing is good but the sound not much high,4
"Good signal strength and distribution. Works with ACT Fiber unlike some comments have seen that created some doubts. Believe Dlink also provides firmware only for hathway. 4 stars as modem does not have wireless on/off, wps and power buttons unlike the tele line model.",4
"Design and looks deserve appreciation… audio quality is fine, loud enough but lacks balance between bass and treble… default settings has a clear vocal and bass but unfortunately you CANT ADJUST TREBLE… and treble is suppressed a lot probably to highlight the vocals… hence the songs lacks sweetness…hope users of these speakers also have experienced the same…the much popular ""V"" shaped custom equaliser profile gives a buzzing sound of bass. FM clarity is praiseworthy… the grills of convertible speakers are delicate enough to catch dents easily…",4
"After using 1 month... In simple lines which every user wants to know... Quality is good, battery is min 5 days WID out charging, accuracy ..out door running is bit erratic, but walking and sleeping track is almost 98% accurate , touch screen is good, App is also good, bit unsatisfied WID belt",4
"Great value for money. Really liked the quality of sound and materials. Connects seamlessly to mobile bluetooth. Touch controls are very sensitive, it took a bit of time to get used to it. Once get used to it, it's very handy to control volume, play/pause, forward/rewind, etc. Overall liked the product and happy about the purchase",4
I like the look of watch but it does not have voice controller of music i didn't find SpO2 in it,4
"Good product ... easy to install and use ... wifi signal is good, only within 20 ft ... on a 100 mbps connection speed comes to 50 - 55 only ...",4

Good phone at this range...much better than samsung m01 and m11,4
Very satisfying.,4
"I had done quite a research before I bought this monitor and if you believe me this is the best monitor in this price range...
Cost varies from 11K to 11.5K, features and design are obviously mentioned in the product description and each of them stands true.

The speakers are good. I checked and there is no backlight bleed in my monitor...

The look kills it and it's worth every penny you buy it for...",4
Meeting expectations,4
Great product. Worked wonderful for 6 months then one side stopped working. Friends got same issues registered my complaint on boat customer service getting a replacement but service is too slow 15-20 days at least from the day you register complaint.,4
Its good and easy to set up...works gr8..if you feel any problem to set up you can contact customer service .They will help you to configure it.,4
"The headphones offer decent sound quality with emphasis on bass. Considering the price point the headphones are good. However if you can stretch your budget, I would recommend to go for some other headphone.",4
Worth of buying,4
"Value for money, very good gadget",4
It’s good but I don’t see a big difference with the WiFi signal or the coverage like the way the technical features have been provided about this product,4
Nice very good product,4
"product received in good condition, easy to install.",4

Good but finger print function is not better in this range I think it is good,4
This band is superb.,4
Amazon great... Delivered with in 16 hours... Sounds quality is good and more compatible connectivity.. but one issue is when changing the TV channels volume differs.. it's not keep fixed volume for all channels..,4
"Camera quality is poor. It's showing low light and low exposure. I compared it with other same mobile, but this handset has poor quality camera",4
Canon camera is good. It is for beginners to start with to learn photography or get knowledge how DSLR works.,4
"Range is not so great. Its not bad, just average. Feature set is really good. This is not returnable or refundable, you can only exchange it for the same model if defective, so buy this only after researching a little bit and making sure it meets all your requirements.",4
While driving it counts steps.,4
The product is great but durability is very less. This product stopped working within 2 months of purchasing date.,4
Product is good...the delivery system is pathetic...better to change the courier service agent..the product is good and very easy to use..,4
Sound quality is worth for money but bluetooth connectivity is very very nice 🤘and excellent,4

But this phone battery life it's not good just because this product not working for 24 hours after 100% charge
Camera features and functions as a good
All features are good but only for battery performance is low",4
"The camera works great and is good for amateurs, but the piece I got doesn’t have the 3.5mm mic jack working.. that’s a real downer :(

In the midst of this Covid situation it’s so difficult, now I have to visit the Sony centre to get it replaced",4
Sleep tracking is accurate. App sync is good. Steps tracking is fake. Should have always on screen option. Charging it is a big task.,4
A little distortion in deep bass.,4
I really liked the way Amazon delivered the product by securing end to end of the camera box but even though the cable which usually comes with cameras aren't present in the box (like HDMI cable ) the camera and lenses performed very well indeed the delivery was quick and trackable thus I conclude by saying Amazon did a great job,4
"Just got it today and already loving it. Nice looks, touch, weight. Seems lovely",4
"Sound quality is very good.
Bluetooth connectivity is also nice.
It could have been very good for those who love to listen FM but for myself it doesn't matter since I don't listen FM on speakers.",4
Easy to install via Tether app,4

good to choose thee product to avoid work disruptions,4
"Highly recomended,very good home threater bass is good,sound quality is good,look is great.",4
"Material doesn't seem much likely to hold for long duration, one year seems doable, the main drawback is that u have to push the earphones a bit too deep to get proper sound, and that's not good at all, otherwise the earphones are ok for their price",4
It is good and perfect but slow in printing,4
"Range Is Good! It Works Good! Does The Job DHCP doesn't work that good when using this router as a repeater but it does the job! properly!
I use MI 3C as my default router and use this as my repeater!",4
"Good earphones with clear sound .
It has enough amount of bass not too high like boat earphones.Mic is also good",4
One of the best phone at this price. It’s great for someone who knows very less about the smart phone world or less techy but wants to use it as smart phone has become a need now.,4
Watch is good but app needs lot of improvement..,4
This printer not supporting for mac. When checked google.it showing that will be support mac but couldn't support so don't buy this printer for mac,4

When it comes to battery backup I get 10-11 hours in normal sound. But in full sound I get almost 8 hours.",4
Best budget smart watch.,4
"Good quality build and output.
Sound seems to be slightly towards bass, so you might miss high freq notes a little.",4
"I have been using it for a couple of days now and here are my impressions about the product:

Pros:
1. Very comfortable. This over the ear headphones perfectly cover the ear completely (medium and large ears as well).
No discomfort is experienced even after prolonged usage ( 3-4 hours continuously).
2. Pretty good sound quality. The 40 mm driver does the job really well. All the frequencies can heard very well.
3. Battery life is quite good. Can easily last a couple of days.
4. Good cushioning is provided.
5. No Bluetooth disconnectivity issues observed.

Cons:
1. Noise cancellation could have been improved. At volume above 80% level, person next to us can listen the sound clearly.
2. They are quite big in size which might be an issue to a few people to carry while travelling.

Overall, the product has good value for money and I am quite satisfied with it.",4
Fingerprint reader is nice,4
Gud sound,4
WIFI STRENGTH and wifi direct option are working good. It comes with HP 803 BOTH BLACK AND TRI COLOUR CATRIDGE. VALUE FOR MONEY SURE.,4
Overall okay product,4
Bought this product after a recommendation from a friend and it works. What I liked the most was the ease of configuration. It has definitely improved connectivity within the house. The enhancement depends on what was the product you used earlier.,4
The speakers are good but it's bass is low,4
"printing quality is good
create sound while printing and print slowly.
supported by window xp,7,8,8.1,10..i am using it with windows 10.
setup is easy..and installation hardly takes 10 to 15 min.
small in size as compare to shown in the pic..so easily portalble.
1 star is less from my side is juz bcz of the sound and slow speed..
although printer in this price range is good..for home purpose.",4
Satisfactory product...,4
Perfect for flat/small apartment or for 2BHK Flats,4
"Finger prints, Battery life camera quality is good",4
"Pros: Strength is amazing for dual band for 10 meter radius.
The 5Ghz bandwidth ping(60ms average) is great for gaming Valotant and CSGO even at 10 meter distance through walls.

Cons: or rather downside with my setup, this router is connected to my access point modem/router. So once in 3 days I need to restart the this router to connect to access point which wasn't the case with my past routers. So yeah, that's a bummer.

Overall: Great router for gaming and mid-large homes.",4
excellent sound quality. but the wire portion near the jack gets cut off . not so durable. after few months one side stops working. and it takes almost a month to replace under warranty.,4
Useful to check on the vital primary parameters. Enables to keep a track on fitness. Accuracy is not to the brim since when I checked the BP there was a slight difference to the reading shown. Else everything is ok BUT if a velcro strap was provided it would have been a wrap around FIT to enable accurate MEASUREMENT.,4
"I would say seller needs to do work with packaging 📦 and. phone delivered to me in good condition but over all its good
About phone it is a mid range phone if you are avrage phone user so it is good choice for you 1.Camera is ok 2.Phone performance is ok according to this price 3.Build quality is ok its fully plastic material 4.about display do not expact supper hd displays its ok not so good not so bad
My opinion if are buying this for kid, mom , dad ,go for it",4
"Was in dilemma before purchasing, as I wanted something to work in sync with power outages and power reinstatements, gracefully. After reading the reviews and using the product for almost 6 months (as of date Aug 2020) I can confirm that there are no wifi signal disruptions during power outages and/or reinstatements. Max backup I have ever needed was for 2.5 hours at a stretch, so was never able to stress test the thing to its limit. Verdict: nifty product, go for it.",4
Nice product with good sound quality but bluetooth connectivity is not stable sometimes.,4
Nice product with economy price,4
Nice mobile. thanks to Amazon,4
Thek h,4
Nice headphones. Quality of sound is fine. Material also good. Light weight as claimed. You can hang it on ears for couple of hours without any trouble. I am going to order black color also. If you are thinking to buy it just have it.,4
Replay,4
Bought mainly because my old router wouldnt give me more than 1Mbps even though ISP was offering 8 Mbps. This one solved the problem now zooming at 7-8 Mbps. Also range is better than my older one.,4
nice product.Very good item,4
"guys the cable is a new type of hdmi which won't connect, you'll have to purchase a hdmi cable separately or a VGA cable for ur use",4
Nothing to dislike,4
Sleep track was not showing properly,4
Earbuds do not fit properly in my ears and keep falling out.,4
"The printer has a classy look , print quality is good , perfect scanning & copying , only a minor complain , it is a bit noisy , overall satisfied ,",4
Excellent product.but noise cancellation is not that much good,4
The signal strength not as expected but installation is very easy and the product is okay,4
Phone is good as per its performance but poor in camera and high heat resulation,4
"It's features are limited. It does the basic function of tracking steps and heart beats etc. But it doesn't differentiate between walking and running. Doesn't automatically detect cycling. These are features which google fit automatically detects. Syncing with phone is a little buggy. At times, if the phone syncs with the device at say, it is 10am, all the steps taken prior to that are erased. Can be better.",4
"Easy installation(didn't face any issues installing on MAC as well). Good quality print. Initial cost is high compared to other kind of printers. But it seems cheaper in the long run. I have used just for a few days, so can't comment on tech support yet. Rest it's working superb!!!",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Product is good , but received in damaged package",4
"Overall a good product and price wise affordable. Even for a senior citizen like me, I could install the App quite comfortably. Offcourse, not being Tech Savvy, I am yet to download or install all the features and at times I get stuck but that is not the Tracker's fault. While the temperature and HR are real time I feel the SpO2 could be real time also. I also suggest that the BP should be like in normal machines and not High, Low, Normal etc. I am using the Tracker now for five days only but am quite satisfied. Subhasish",4
My house is 2600 sqft and the signal is supreme in all parts or the house. I live on 4th floor and I can connect to mi wifi sitting in my car in Parking,4
Some time signel automatically goes off,4
"For 5k its worth it , so far so good.",4
Good product in this price range go for it,4
"I am really impressed with it's sound quality . It will not hurt your ears if played very loudly . The low , mids and high tones are impressed , you are definitely going to enjoy the sound quality , after all it's JBL .",4
Okk,4
Well it a good printer with a good print quality but the cartridge ran out of ink after printing just 100 pages,4

"Amazing 🤩 phone in buget
Nice battery life... Till now and screen is also good you may go with it! Buy it guys!!",4
"Screenshot not work through volume down and power button, direct power off and restart option came and if do 3 times phone restart",4
Camera is good at this price. Don't expect more than this in 9k. Overall good produ by Mi.,4
"Bought this product to use as an extender, and it has done a good job so far. The dedicated wifi-extenders are costly and they either have one or two small less powerful antennas compared to this device. The set-up was very easy, and never had any problems till now.",4
"Great product, must purchase.",4
Sound quality good...all over good product,4
Better quality but valium not high ... Aawag adik karne par not good sound .. kisi ko lena ho ya batter jankari leni ho to call me 9772110938,4
best router,4
best camera,4
Good for WFH purpose.. but no audio output means its use is very limited 😐😐,4
"After ten days of use. I honestly think that Camera picture quality, motion detection & night vision is very good but Tapo app not working properly. Apps went offline twice, despite everything being fine.",4
works great,4
The quality is good but the wire provided by them is very thin. Rest sound quality is very giod. The also vibrates on high bass songs. 4 stars just because of thin wire,4
"I am writing this review after 5 months. This product is absolutely good. Even at high sound I cannot hear any distortion or anything. So sound quality is the best. It is not a noise cancelling headphone so can't talk about it. Its noise isolation is good. Nothing from outside comes inside and nothing from inside goes outside. Its bass quality is amazing. It fits perfectly on the ear only in one position but when it does, its supercomfy. It is also compact so you can carry it when you are on a journey.
Sound clarity : 8/10
Mic : 9/10
Comfort: 9/10

This is an edition of the review after a year of rough use. Now It's been a year and I've been using it daily about 7 hours a day. The mic stopped working but I don't use the mic often. The soft fabric coating on the ear cushions literally ""shed"" and now the foam is only remaining. But even the foam is very soft for my use. Even now it is comfortable on the ears.
Sound clarity : 8/10
Mic : 0/10
Comfort : 9/10",4
All things are good except the data cable which is not present in the box. Seller need to mention all accessories list in the bill.,4
Good product for this rate. Good bass(not extreme ).. good quality sound..,4
"Stylish & useful. However, the volume needs to be raised for best sound quality. There are models which give sames effect in lower audio-volume settings.",4
"Good product for BSNL broadband. But you need to manually configure it if you want to use it for a BSNL connection. Don't let it get hot, else it shuts down, that is what the BSNL line man told me.",4
Nice base I like this product,4
"Packaging. Is disgusting it's worst . I always face that kind of problem with Amazon . The box is broken once I doubted on product originality but by checking the product is fit and fine that's why i didn't replaced it .
Now all about product
It's awesome .
Sound quality osmm
Base osmm
I got it for 999rs so price is osmm
Battery life is mind blowing I used it for 40 min and not a single % of battery drain I think it last for 6 to 7 hrs smoothly
Charging is fast
Connectivity is good with phone but I faced some issue in sound quality when I connected it with my Android tv .
Also I like recording songs the recording is not good
Also the quality is not that much cristal clear types like my boat 225 wired earphone , philips headphones , apple airpods 2 , and realme buds but it's decent I can say aux connectivity is also good it's amazing",4
Almost Everything is good about this product but the app to run this is not responsive.,4
"Received this item on 30/06/2020, the item is very good in terms of the monitor. The size is also adequate. Size greater than this like 24"" monitor or 27"" monitor becomes very big. This can not be used as TV because of two reasons. The first reason is inbuilt speakers are not of good quality and level is also quite low. The second reason is it is a monitor so it does come with a remote to change input source from HDMI1 to HDM2 or to VGA, so, you need to change the input source by clicking on buttons below the monitor.",4
"WiFi signal seems good, although takes around 4-5 mins to connect. Not rating on tech support or installation convenience, as didn't face any issue and the fiber connection technician installed it.",4
Sound quality is good but not sooo brilliant...noice cancellation is 100 percent and bass quality is also good,4
Quality also approx good....Aswm charger I loved it and great price ♥️,4
Low cost printer going to use it only for office work.,4
"It's giving good feedback with good accuracy and it has good features too ..but talking about battery life ... it is just draining out within 10 to 12 days which is disappointing ..
That's y I am giving it 4 stars ...",4
"C1200:- I was on 30mbps earlier. Was receiving full speed (sometimes a little more with nat boost) on both bands. Now, I am on 100mbps internet. Getting almost full speed on the 5GHz band. But the range of 5GHz is not that great (maybe similar compare to other same price range routers). It covers my home first floor around 1000sq.ft but there is no 5GHz signal on the 2nd floor. 2.4GHz band works well considering its range. I even receive enough signal to the second floor, in every corner. But I was getting around 50-60mbps only in this band. Disabling Nat boost did the trick- now it's going up to 85-90Mbps. Restarting router takes around a min. The cloud option works well. Also have not experienced any kind of lag or hang. Have not checked USB connectivity. So far, a good purchase.",4
Nice product.....variety for themes is very less... Watch face option should have more variety,4
"Good product, sound quality is very good, only it has thin wires. Overall product is awesome",4
"I have been using for 6 months. This is still working in good condition. It can be bought, product is worthwhile.",4
I have started using the product today. Overall looks good,4
"I ordered this phone just because it appeared ""made in India"" in Amazon. But the product which I got is ""Made in China"". This is unethical.",4
I am using this from last 3 months worth buying. In given cost .,4
Sound is good but bluetooth not good.sometime connect and leave.,4
Nice band in it class. Customizable watch faces (third-party) a bit tricky to apply. Battery life is great. Overall satisfactory product.,4
Camera quality is above decent but pics come out quite good.Fast charging is helpful in daily use.Design is good.Sd 439 works smooth if you are doing daily tasks.No lag.Gaming is not preferred but light gaming can be done easily.Better than realme c3 or c11.,4
Good fit,4
Average product suitable for above 60 years,4
Good Watch,4
Good Router for 800 bucks in sale. Easy to setup and use. Overall network strength is not too good even though it has 2 antennas specially in case of walls.,4
"I have used this watch for 1 month now. everything is fine, just the battery doesnt last as promise. i have to recharge this every 3 days.",4
Nice smart watch with activity tracker,4
It's all nice and good,4
Good product router featurs very well but it has only two lan ports range upto400sq feet,4
"Being JBL is JBL
Just the wire a short
And good Bass if you get the equilizer settings adjusted in the mobile",4
"Cons :
1. Lags a lots.
2. do not trust the battery life it is equal to 3000MAH not 5000Mah",4
It's tight to head. After using for 2 hours our ears will start paining. It's not over the ear headphones.,4
Best headphone at cost of 500.. bought it in a sale.. like it,4
"* Good WiFi Performance
* Low price good value
* All Gigabit ports
* No USB port
* Limited features",4
"been using for 3 months now .. is a good tracker ..
swim tracking is ok ..not super accurate ..
cycling tracking is the worst .. shows way too many KM's
turning off continuous heart tracking to enjoy 20+ days of battery life.

Getting it off the strap is very hard .. but looks like MI fixed the flaw with the 2nd gen strap which had an inner ring that kept coming off ..",4
Watch is good but rise to wake up response very poor,4
Battery is Not Up to The Mark,4
Bought it for a poor kid who needed to study during covid. Decent phone at a good price.,4
As per others sound quality was not good,4
I am using it for the BSNL broadband and instillation was super smooth. I am very happy with the performance - both wireless as well as Ethernet.,4
Good product ..,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Awesome product lovely",4
nice and easy,4
"Works smoothly, is sturdy also priced competitively. Range works great till 30 feet but starts to get weak after that; but still a great product.",4
A very good HD display with eye care technology which helps reduce eye stress. Would have been a perfect display with additional hdmi or a usb connector.,4
"Very nice product ,delivery on time and very comfortable to use for jogging ant running.",4
Again another great boat product for its price. Bass could be better (if you are looking more for that). But over great music output. Build quality could be more better I guess looks a bit fragile (like it might crack if dropped from a height or something) But I have had no complaints from boat so far😄😄😄.,4
"Printing quality is good
For small use we can buy this
Ink cartridge can be refilled by seeing YouTube video's",4
Great full HD monitor from samsung. But it is shaky with the stand if you dont have a sturdy table. Or else you could use wall mount. I use it with my laptop with a HDMI output. It is a good monitor for casual use. But it does not have an audio output port. Its the only drawback.,4
"It's a good product (only been 1 week though, will update later on).
Looks good.
Works well.
Sleek, light weight.

Following are some nit-picking from the initial experience:
Not easily accessible ports (These are behind screen; hidden).It could have been way better if these would have been on the side.
The stand is good looking, but not practical. It's not height adjustable.",4
Nice good achha hai 6 month bad thora Mora diktat aa rhi touch kabhi kaam nhi karta hai battery bhi tikta nhi hai,4
"It's a great earphone in terms of sound quality, bass and noise cancellation, build quality is really good, but there's a part I would like to call it earphone 'tang' where the left and right indication is remarked looks weak to me but that doesn't mean it'll break easily, other than that it's awesome.",4
Sleep tracking. Amazing,4
It's good but not that great,4
"Full touch, battery backup, connectivity good. We need to arrange the apps in our order wise. Mi band having this feature...",4
very good,4
Surprisingly good for the price.,4
Simply nice 🙂,4
"A great pair of earbuds in 2k. Bass is good, call quality is good. Noise cancellation could be slightly better but still good for this price range.",4
Overall it's a good printer.,4
"Good printer and it's picture quality, but it' cartige is not affordable ,very costly . only average 40black page and 8-9 colour print are printed and cartige is totally empty",4
Received the product 100% perfect condition. Thanks to the seller and The Amazon ❤️ Love you,4
Nice product in low range. I am satisfy.,4

Good product.Nice deal With Snap Deal,4
Good product for students and also for householders to measure their fitness.,4
Nice app,4
"It's my first router. So I had lil trouble configuring it for my BSNL dataone internet connection. But once I figured it out, everything is working fine. Tat incl my laptop and my family's 4 Android phones. At the end of the day, I am very happy with this device and Amazon's delivery service which seems to be on time everytime and is getting better than Flipkart and Snapdeal.",4
"Due to lock-down restrictions, I got the product late. Latter, after using it for 2 days I realized the step counter was not working properly. Amazon was quick to arrange the replacement. Now, the replaced watch is working fine. The look, feel and features of Endure is really good. I just hope that this lasts for long.",4
"Best product with Best price
Spo2 & BP checking is excellent feature",4
"I BOUGHT IT RS 2900/- ONLY ....
THIS IS VALUE FOR MONEY ...
WE CAN PRINT THE DOCUMENT THROUGH MOBILE PHONE ALSO WITH THE HELP OF OTG
TO CONNECT THIS PRINTER WITH MOBILE PHONE FIRST WE HAVE TO INSTALL HP SMART PRINTER APP AND HP PRINTER APP FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE THAN WE CAN EASILY PRINT PHOTOS & DOCUMENTS FROM MOBILE PHONE ETC.",4
"vary nice product . various activities are tracked.
light weight. unlimited face watches.",4
"I like this product. My daily routine is to walk a minimum of 4-5kms at least,so this product is very useful for me.",4
Good for listening but not for call and noise cancellation,4
"Best all in one printer, however the printing of photoes does appear to be a little bit of low in their quality comparitively to canon and the Gsm support could be higher,

Scanning part could be made a little bit fast, even for lowest quality scanning, it's takes around 1 min

Otherwise for Xerox, and printing B/w this is THE best in the competition
The print speed is takes around 25 second for one sheet on highest quality for B/W

Thus a good alrounder for home use, while i would not recommend for colour printing and mainly on higher gsm",4
Everything is ok...Nice....It getting slight delay to show display after hand twist.....And it doesn't contain more watch faces and customize faces option this is disadvantage,4
great deal in this price...,4
Really love the monitor,4
Very good &powerful performance and also very attractive,4
Screen should be 1080P,4
"Charger not working within a month of purchase.
The mobile is very good for its price.
The fingerprint & face recognition is not upto mark.
Camera & battery are good",4
"Nice product... At the very beginning it is a bit inconvenient... as it is tight, But it's perfectly fine now",4
I am using from 1 month and I got really nice results from this mobile . Battery backup is so better and also camera .,4
Printer is excellent.scanning also high quality. But black cartridge only comes for 200 pages.again more expensive for filling cartridges.good choose for purchase at this cost,4
Nice watch but the BP measurements are far from accurate.,4
Decent for the price.,4
"Cartridges are now empty.
Need one urgently.....",4
Very good buy.... This router is sufficient for my apartment.... good signal strength...... sometimes \need to restart to get a good signal...otherwise a good buy,4
4 कैमरा जैसा लगता है धोका है... फ्लेक्स light नही है camera quality अच्छी नही है.... Y2 का जैसा सब same है.... Not Good,4
With cell phone connection print out take much time. Some time it seems paper stuck in between,4
"You can buy this product but ensure that the folding of headphones is not 360 ,so one should avoid giving the headphones to other person ,and i suggest company should make changes in the 360 folding",4
No memory card,4
Good quality.. Value for money,4
"I have purchased in Diwali offer, good price range bank discount.",4
M pretty happy vth dis product.,4
"I am using it for a month now, and its a really good router at this price tag.
Range is good enough for a small house provided that you put it in open space.
It has 2 antennas helps to give you the same speed as that of wired connection.
I hardly see any fluctuation in speed as compared to my other router (Cisco) which has lot of issues.
Overall a nice product, I am happy with it.",4
I am writing this product on the day I received the product. I am using it with mac mini (2018) no issues. I have tested it for browsing and movies. I have not tested it for games as I am not into it. I really liked the reader mode and very wide range of adjustment features provided with the monitor. The button given for the feature adjustment however does not look long lasting. I have given four star because they could have given a button of better quality for adjustment. The clarity with mac mini is fantastic for 1080p and 720p. They additionally have 1920 x 1600 (very good for reading). The hdmi cable along with it is okay but I prefer my belkin cable which is more smooth in terms of plugging in or out with mac and monitor. Overall seems a nice monitor for the price let us now see how long it can perform at this rate.,4
There was a dent in one speaker,4
Battery backup is good and camera quality is not good as it shows,4
Product is costly then similar quality available at half it's price.,4
"I received the product on Saturday and I have been using the product since without needing to charge it a second time. The watch looks subtle on hand especially with the black strap.
I saw some reviews which talked about not consistent tracking of BP but I checked it for my satisfaction and I was happy that it was very true and consistent.
All the features work perfectly and the mobile app integration is nice too.

Overall, it's a good product and with body temperature tracking added in these covid times, it really comes in handy.

Update
Maybe the glass quality can be improved as my hand just hit a wall and it has 2-3 scratches over it.",4
"First of all delivery was on time & very quick.. Thanks amazon.. Band is nice good screen quality, great features.. Unlimited watch faces.. Screen size can be little bit big.. But at this price point it is worth it..",4
Very nice 👍,4
"Everything is working as expected only problem is with pedometer . It is registering steps even when i am sitting or driving even when i am sleeping and i am sure i don't sleep walk 😂 .. I don't know whether it's hardware realted issue or software if it's software realted issue please provide fix Xiaomi . So if you are buying it for because yiu want to count steps then it's not for you . Sleeping tracking accurate enought like 98% ,heart beat and stress accuracy is also btween 96 -98% overall accuracy is about 95% .Haven't tested battery life but so for it seem like it will not give battery backup of 2 week as claimed by Xiaomi it ll give max 7 days to 10 days of backup. They advertise battery saver mode but I can't find it anywhere if anyone know how to keep band on battery saver mode please tell me.",4
Very good poo phone in this price,4
It's good budget smart watch with good features....worth a try,4
Good product. Touch screen operation smooth and very responsive. Mobile app good. I am not aware whether I can log on to Mi fit website and see details of my workout in PC or Laptop,4
Just received... Review will follow soon,4
Very decent headphones for such price. I purchased the same model 2 years back and at that point in time it costed me 1999 bucks! Now it's price dropped and believe me it's a great deal now. Good bass and nice sound quality. Sony knows how to make audio video entertainment products with stylish and working design.,4
Nice phone in that price range,4
"Yes the product is amazing and genuine and again I would say Amazon has won the trust from the ones who find it hard to shop offline...so thank you Amazon, Jeff Bezos!",4
Good quality,4
"If you are looking for a good display and camera,don't go for this model.",4
"Many Function are still not working even after activating them like Call notification, SO2, sleep timer??",4
Some times touch screan issues occure. S9me time watch get hang. But overally its a good product in this price segment.,4
"The watch is quite good , worth its price.",4
This product is best for teenagers and adult too .Its better for sports men .,4
Good out-of-the-box experience. Easy to setup and working flawlessly for the past 3 months. Speed and coverage are good.,4
Tracking data is good just want to mention about the app which I have encountered while using once or twice application was not working completely so I need to reinstall the app again so there is a scope of improvement in mobile application,4
"It's a good phone under 5000k , value for money.",4
Happy with product ...SpO2 and stress measures are not accurate but heart rate and other workout its accurate..,4
"Works as discriped. Bit time taken for setting up. Don't waste time buying 64gb and above memory Card. Supports only upto 32gb.
Rest all fine",4
"Nice easy to install, good product",4
"Awesome product but battery needs to be more mah
Much better than mi smart band 3
Nice display
Heart rate is not quite accurate but it's fine
So buy this product",4
"Sound is flowing outside from the headphone , even the clarity can be improve , overall good product.
Super fast delivery",4
Good product. Can be priced better.,4
"Sound quality is good but sometimes I find treble is irritating me but overall good and bass is too good.
I got headphone with logo fire boltt while on Amazon it is showing only boltt on product image.
Second there is no gold plated Jack in headphone instead of this it is silver plated.
And I got the box which is completely damaged but product was ok.",4
Good product value for money 💰,4
"The product is good,it's not that heavy as it looks in the picture,very lite and small. But I noticed a problem,when I keep that headphone in neck,it got a sharp edge which hurts your neck continuasly,other than this if you don't have a habit of headphones you ear can start pain,as the placement of the earkhushans..bit small for regular ears..other than this a normal nd simple product to use..",4
bass is good sound quality is good noise cancellation not there overall good but cost is more,4
I need Data Cable ASAP,4
Its a combine product and very helpful for new users,4
Watch is Accurate for steps and km but sometimes App stops when we clear cache of mobile. Also heart sensor not kinda good,4
Ram should be 4gb,4
"awesome product ..its very portable and have tested in a closed 2 bed room house (like 1200 sqft overall) and got good signal coverage

worth for the cost..forget about the branding and costly ones..this serves your purpose

and also they are very genuine ..on back side of the product box, they have mentioned which model supports more range

the next versions which costs like 900 rs range would support more coverage area",4
"IT'S GREAT ITEM
I ORDERED 2 ITEMS
BUT I RECEIVED 1 ITEM ONLY
&
NO REFUNDS MY MISSING ITEM BY SELLER",4
Good cam for beginners,4
"on off button missing,

overall good product,",4
"Really loved the new version in terms of:
1. Screen quality is very rich and bright
2. Health related features are accurate
3. Customisable and very user friendly firmware

Dislike:
'Package'. Mi Band 5 box design gives very cheap look. Would really love if they would've maintained the overseas design, since that gives the premium look and feels better when gifted to someone. That's where it lost 1 star.",4
Signal is a little bit weak but allover considering the features router is damn good.,4
"Very convenient and reliable product. Though it suffered some problem after 5 month use, the same was replaced by manufacturer instantly. Very good customer service.",4
"Product is good, bur delivery person didnt come to deliver at home, he call to come on half way for delivery(veru bad experience).",4
"The range is not as long as I expected but long enough. Also the transfer rate over WLAN is miserable and when USB connected to the modem the speed doesn't exceed 800 kbps which is way below the expected speed. I mentioned the above to slink, they told me to get it replaced. Everything else not mentioned are pros. Still priced very reasonable and feature filled.",4
"The sound from headphones is good, but the microphone creates a constant noise when using it in audio or video calls.",4
This item is very nice. Camera quality is also good . I think this product is the best for this price . Delivery is very fast on this product.,4
"Hardware received is V3.2. Description and pictures in listing are of V2.
WiFi signal coverage is decent enough for 2bhk. WiFi link speeds are good at 5ghz and easy to install. Few smart features are value add on to this device.
Booting time is almost 2mins, which is considerable delay compared to other WiFi routers.",4
It is a good product just a oroblem with irritation of ears if you wear goggles or specs. It can also cause irritation if used for time more than 30 min.,4
मेरा मो. बिल send करें,4
Nice products,4
Good Connectivity,4
"1. BP monitor is absolutely far away from accuracy.
2. Pulse, Oxymeter, Pulse etc are fantastic
3. Exercise mode, display features fabulous

5. Additional features like health video, health shopping etc are of great help and no other product provides you such features.",4
👌🏻,4
Its really good,4
Ok..,4
print qoulity is good,4
Product seems to good quality,4
Touch screen and battery backup is very good....... over all build quality is also very good,4
Very good phn camera not good as expect,4
Perfect,4
One of the best in the market,4
"Looks are good , specs are good for budget good for light or heavy user",4
"Accuracy is good in case of heart rate or stress and workout but pedometer is not counting the number of steps properly
while walking rather counting the movement of hands and counting the steps while riding in any vehicle.",4
Configuring was somewhat difficult but it is good router. Area coverage was really good. Delivery was fast though. Thumb's up.,4
"Excellent product for the price. i use it as universal repeater. just plug and play. range is very good. highly recommended.
light weight. no problem
using past two weeks.",4
Very good sounds and nice working spakar,4
I like the phone build quality and its good value pack for midrange mobiles.,4
Easy to handle for beginners,4
It's a great band with almost all features but don't forget to put a screen protector as soon as you buy it as my screen had a little scratch when I crashed with a bench. The screen is little popped out.,4
Product is good at this budget.. camera is good ..battery stays for long.. but gets a litte hot.... And the charger too..,4
"BEST BAND UNDER THIS PRICE RANGE . ONLY PROBLEM IS WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE WATCH FROM THE BAND WHILE CHARGING, BUT ITS OK BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CHARGE AFTER 15 TO 20 DAYS. GO FOR IT I HAVE PURCHASED FOR ₹2298 THE BEST BAND .",4
Tripod.Nice one.. Good product to use,4
running is not that accurate i would say but its ok,4
"I was originally using deco E 4 route and was fully satisfied However after upgrading broadband speed to 200 Mbps realised the limitations of E4.It can only provide speed upto 100 mbps
So had to upgrade the mesh router. This time I decided to keep myself future ready.Opted for This router as it can support over 500 mbps on 2.4 GHz and over 1Gbps at 5.0 GHz and at same time can accommodate my existing E 4 deco routers in same mesh network .
Performance wise it is good and a set of 2 is enough to cover 2500 sq feet of single storied house but you will need at least 3 for larger area.",4
Print yeild is low.,4
Best product at this price point ... the vocals aare good and the bass is also good !!! You can bye this for your small or medium type of rooms ... !! The best feature in this speaker system is the fully functional remote control with bass/trable control and 5.1/2.1 modes !! You are able to control the each speakers output with the remote !! And the second best feature is the 5.1 DVD input !!,4
overall okay with respect to price,4
ITS SOUND PERFORMANCE IS GOOD. BUT FM RADIO SIGNAL RECEIVED POOR.,4
"Boats is the best. Budget able prices and good quality products.
In this price you won't get such a good headphone.",4
All good affordable prices,4
"First of all satisfied with the early scheduled delivery.
It makes very difficult to configure and identify that the LAN cable is damaged. It cost me additional 500/- to ask a technician to help me out to setup my this modem router.",4
A high quality product,4
"The router is good , having good range and able to handle multiple devices well",4
"Fit band is good, needed more accuracy for foot step count and screen size little smaller then expected, battery is good Only problem I found if u sync to ur phone then by using watch only unlock ur phone or need try hard without it...",4
Thanx amazon for this product .i had tried to lots of time to bought this but many time it shows out of stock .but when i checked it out its available i immediate bought it.we eagerly waited for this product and we got it thanx amazon,4
"There is a connectivity issue in the watch . Whenever if a off the bluetooth , the watch took too much time to connect and the battery also draijing very fast . Otherwise the product is good .",4
Buy the second lens also.,4
"I had purchased this Last month end after searching in vain for an Indian made fitness tracker. Alhough the GOQii Vital is made in China, the Design / development of the device is claimed to be Indian and American.
The features in the tracker are quite good, but it takes time to get familiar with the product. I had issues with navigating through the menu in the GOQii App, but the support team were quite prompt and hand held me to help me with each one of my issues. I could see that the heart rate measurement, temperature and steps counting are verifiable and apparently good. The Oxygen saturation level in blood is also ok. I could not confirm the BP measurement. The battery life could be however still better then seven days.
There is also “Tracking HbA1c” But this apparently has to be recorded manually.
Overall a good product.",4
"Overall a wonderful product in this price, would suggest to add a feature for music volume control “increase/decreae”. Rest all working smoothly.",4
Best one to start with.,4
The sound is amazing. Just the touch control is somewhat bad,4
"Oxygen level not so accurate, Battery Life is good, BPM as said not so accurate, Sleep monitor works but not sure how good and you cannot wear the watch always as the Strap make's me feel uncomfortable and sticky, need a cotton strap, looks great, Stress level is a good add-on as I can control my self if I get hypertension,
As of now I am loving it, 👍👍👍",4
"I've bought two watches for wife and me. Applications and info it collect is good. How ever nothing to measure for precise info. Look wise awesome. It gives premium feel. However I was expecting belt should have a little better quality wise, they have used same quality of belt for all models.

I've also bought 2 more watches ⌚ amazfit BIP U they are almost same considering features however size wise a little small screen and battery. This could be a better option if you don't want more money.

There are four users in my family and we all are very happy with our smar watches.",4
Having High sound quality with microphone. Love this,4
this is a very good product and it does what it promise to do. very convenient and hassle free power back up.,4
Value for money got at a good deal good screen size decent storage and ram but needs to improve on volume,4
"The sponge quality is not good ,used it for 15 days , the sponge is becoming wet with in 20 mins ,",4
Hello guys. I have been using this speaker like 5 months and its works very nice and i like its sub woofer too. Worth of money don't think much just go for it guys👍👍,4
Nice product. Really helpful. Using from couple of months. Pls check your wifi router voltage parameters before buying the product.,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Pros : Good build quality, Excellent Battery backup experienced already, several options, excellent display, Band to App connectivity is seamless, fast Sync and MI App is very user friendly.
Cons : Removal of battery is not at ease, charging port is loose on all MI 4 band. ( I used a rubber to grip it properly )
I see on some forums that the issue with charging port has been already complained to MI.",4
"The product was well packaged. It was fully protected. I found the product easy to install. You can use the given CD. But if you have some information about modem setup, then you can directly set it up after connection it from the modem page (192.168.1.1). The range of the modem is tooooooooooo good. I have two floored house and even at the ground floor it shows 4 bars. So in my opinion range the more than enough if you are living in a flat or single story house. There was no connection drop what so ever if you talk about modem (don't consider it as modem's fault if problem is with your ISP. Mine is BSNL so you can imagine the rest). By far the best modem.",4
Giving 4 stars because range is not that great than other Dlink router at this budget,4
"In this price range ,this is best player 👍good bass but there is no bass and terible control but there are various equaliser presets mods ..light effect in subwoofer is too good in dark
Fm, pendrive, card , and bluetooth and 3.5 mm support",4
"Worth price and with Dual band it is good to seperate the connectivity speeds and ranges
Need to make use of One_Mesh technology",4
The technician had visit and explained the product very well.,4
LIKE LOW QUALITY SPEAKER SUPER SUBWOOFER,4
"It's good in quality and the delivery was done with no damage to the packaging or the product itself.
Thanks,",4
Screen quality and battery quality is quite decent but camera is not so impressive.,4
Absolutely VFM product. It works very well but costs much less than many other famous brands. I have been using it for an year. Recommended.,4
"Just simply Super, equal to Apple Watch. Nice look, nice design and nice style, good features. Thanks to Amazfit and Amazon.",4
The copy quality is very bad with a line cutting across the page.....,4
Go ahead,4
"So after much hue and cry for the made in India products .. I was forced to buy this with the rating !
To the review ..
Pros :
1.Hassle free installation ...super smooth
2. Coverage is good....not great
3.improvwd use of my internet speed with MIMO tech
4. Good built and design
Cons:
1.Signal drops by 2 points with 2 walls within 5m distance.
2. Erratic signals sometimes",4
Good product for office meetings and listening music..,4
"Nice product
Good seller
Awesome packing",4

Sleep tracking is not much good....touch screen and other applications are good...mobile app also nicely working.,4
Good one !!,4
Very good 👍,4
Good Product 👍 but WiFi Signal is not Good 🥺,4
Works really well. But even with 2 5dbi antennas I couldn't get good range. Had to buy a repeater to extend the range. Would have gave another star if the range was good enough. But overall it can be a good choice.,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Very good looking , nice display, close to accurate reading.",4
I have purchased tp link archer c6 from amazon surprised to see the design has changed it looks like archer a6. Need to find out if it still works as old c6 model.,4
"Day 2:
This is the cheapest deskjet/inkjet printer available. Good for home / student use only.
Convenient for printing pages which you don't want to share at a photocopying/printing shop from privacy/confidentiality perspective. Printing at such shops is much cheaper than home printer.
This is lightweight and doesn't take lot of space.

This is not having scan/copy functions. (that is the reason why it is cheap and lightweight)
This printer doesn't have Wireless connectivity etc. This connects only using USB with Windows OS based computer.
Print clarity and quality is satisfactory. Yet to explore further.

Right now, I'm yet to check how long cartridge goes on. will post based on experience further.",4
"Using it for fifteen days.
Good phone in this range.
Camara is okay okay
Battery runs for full day but it takes 4 hour to get it fully charged.",4
Configuration and price is good along with Amazon discount but not received as promised delivery date...delayed by 1 day...I got one problem - notification centre when dragged down shows no option for a while than I have to restart it. Then it worked,4
"Stop stop 😬
First of all don't be too confused I did a research on fitness tracking watch.
If you love accuracy don't go for anything other than apple or fitbit(high end model)
Other than accuracy everything was fine in this .app seems to be nice after one week of use.
For low budget guys like me I'll suggest this one .
The problem I noticed is accuracy when I compared spo2 with oxymeter ( that to 2 to 3% variation).
So over all review is good.",4
They do the job. But cannot handle full volume. Full volume becomes noise since the headphone doesnt handle high treble well!,4
"I have been using tplink A6 router since 2 months, it's working absolutely fine. I have got c3 version of this router, it's signal strength is also very good I have kept it in ground floor and getting good connectivity on 1st floor also gets connected with just 1 signal strength on 2nd floor, I am also getting good speed and installation and initial settings are also very simple, 2.4/5Ghz both so definitely for me this is good product specially with 4 antennas at given price.",4
"Product is good, original, well built and looks sturdy. The 2.4 GHz signal range is great. It reached all the corners of my 1600 Sq feet house without a drop in strength. The 5 Ghz is fine too, though it won’t survive the bends and edges of a typical house with concrete walls. The smart connect is not very smart. Once it latches to the 2.4 GHz signal when you move a bit away from the router, it doesn’t switch back to the faster 5Ghz signal when you move closer to the router. It stays on 2.4 GHz.

Speeds- With ACT 200 Mbps plan I get 190 Mbps on 5 GHz and 90-100 GHz on 2.4 GHz. I found the LED control feature very handy wherein you could set the LED indicators on the router to go off during a particular time period. So far so good.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Sleep tracking is not up to the expectations. When your are awake In middle of night to attend nature call or some other issue. It closes sleep cycle.",4
Nice One.,4
"Budget phone,",4
"brought the phone for my mother for its form factor, good louder sound. decent buy",4
"I am not writing pros & cons here !
Bass is okay you shouldn't expect best at this price though highs and mid tunes are also good ..If you get it under 600 grab it !",4
Good sound. ..quality is best. .,4
"Price increased with time. It must cost around 1300.
If price is sane then why not people should buy actual ups supply for computer which could be used for router.",4
"Finger print reader is great
Battery 🔋 life is also great
For camera quality,I share a photo",4
"This is a very good product under this price range. Having said that, it is bit backwards when it comes to communication especially via Skype. Rest assured movies n music all good.",4
"Print is good but here r the some small issues
1) Wifi print is too slow
2) USB data cable is too small Inshort it just 3 ft
3) installing software for wifi is so difficult but little tricky for 1st timer
4) u need to have the bigger data cable to connect the cpu which is most uncomfortable thing to connect.
5) usb connected prints r awesome & fast
6) over all it’s good printer but 2 way print is bit confusing...still don’t know how to print both sides automatically...",4
Value for the money we spent.,4
Overall very good,4
Very nice phone. Battery backup too good.,4
Everything is good but takes a little time to be active.,4
Nice product... Good sound quality,4
"Amazing finishing, great speed worth for money.",4
Printer is good. Scan and print quality also good. But setup takes more time to understand the product and installation. I did myself and it's working fine. Thank you Amazon for the good product.,4
Very good product from sony.. but sound quality a littile bit poor.. in this range of price a fantatic headset for all...,4
Good watch but touch screen improve,4
"Smart but not so smart, not able to do multitasking.
Else built quality is good and easy to wear for longer durations.",4
"Bluetooth connectivity is very bad pls do not buy this product.
It automatically connects to another device while already connected to one device.
So your music flow will be interrupted and you will be frustrated.",4
"Battery life is good as mentioned.
Camera quality is good as compared to the brand.",4
"Good Quality Sound.. I liked it very much..
Bass quality is awesome...
Crystal Clear sound...
But...

Surrounding was missing Little bit....",4
REally good product but there is no bass and treble control,4
Battery life is not good,4
"Configuration was quite easy.
Having some trouble getting to use the parental contraols - that don't seem to work too well",4
Coverage is very less.Some issues are there.Sometimes it requires power off to get wifi. Don't know why.Otherwise nice product for very small house.,4
It is good but does not always cover all rooms of a two story house.,4
I have always preferred Redmi phones just only because of very good battery back up over a long time hope it doesn't disappoint me.,4
Love the product... Happy to buy it.. using for 4-5 months n no issue faced till date. Very useful for while driving.. Apart from that using while running n cycling for measuring distance....,4
I like this product most. It's a one of great and amazing product,4
Liked the display of watch. Battery life is 1/3rd of promised 14 hours by company.,4
"This is slightly costly but still a good product.
1. Clear installation guidance
2. easy to install
3. Good wifi range
4. you even may not require 5GHz (dual band) if your internet connection is good/consistent.",4
"80-85% accuracy.
Best apps
Can read whole Notifications from all apps,
Heath tracking data all on watch, no need to use aap.

Cons
3 to 4 days battery back-up only
Strap quality is not good, itchy",4
"Phone is looking good and the features are also good. Camera has features like panorama(motion images) and macro( which shows near objects very clearly as our eye and shows distinct objects not clear) which helps in taking pictures of our documents etc.. and coming to battery it is giving good battery life if we use less it comes nearly 2days I use it vigorously it comes a whole a day to me .

And disadvantages are weight it weights more than 200g so if we take a call for more time holding it in your hand it will pain. And another point they should give screen guard and outer cover for phone as it is new model these are not available outside. All the major companies are giving these.",4
Everything is good... But it has no other verities of watch straps...,4
"When we place an order for any product online and even after watching a million unboxing videos & reviews - we are always curious about ""what is inside the box"". I thought my sharing the pictures, everyone gets an idea of the same.

My experience in the first 48 hours has been a mixed bag but primarily positive. The configuration is not that easy as some Youtube reviewers make it to be. Some of the features are buried deep in the UI and the UI is very easy to understand & navigate so finding these features is easy.

Coming to accuracy, it is almost 90-95% accurate. SPO2 reading might not work on every execution but when it works it is also 90-95% accurate. The sports modes are useful and I compared the treadmill mode with the actual reading on my treadmill and they were almost the same.

In short, I am liking it for the price point and if you look at some of the features in the app - you will notice that some are disabled which for me is a hope that a lot of features can be included or activated using OTA updates.

Looking forward to the experience and at least it is a good change from all the heavy smartwatches I am using now.",4
Amazing Value for money phone.,4
"good,",4
"Overall a good product ....the signal is quite stable with bsnl connection.
Easy to install.
Bought it only for 1169 in the Diwali Dhamaka offer.",4
"This printer is good for home usage. While the look and design is good, print quality is better. There is just one issue that i have faced that, printer at times doesn't turn on and you have to wait for a while for the same.",4
"The only problem is....... It sounds out side the ear also.
Otherwise it's awesome product
After 6 month of use every thing is going good",4
You can trust on amazfit products,4

good router easy to configure...small size but network area is good,4
"I got my headphone replaced yesterday. I am satisfied, my warranty claim wad approved. It could be the same one repaired or new one for it. Anyhow I am happy and changing my review.

Call the customer service no first and raise your complaint. They will send someone to pickup the damaged product. Then they check the damage and replace it.

Old review: Its wire got damaged after 2 months of purchase. I wrote an email to claim a warranty and it had been 2 and half week now. There is no response from Boat. After sales customer service seems to be pathatic. It appears, they don't value a customer at all. If I don't get any response within a month from a warranty claim request. I will share my experience on all the social media platform to make sure others know how much they value their customers. In total I have like more than 10000 people listed with me on all the platforms.",4
Great Bass but microphone stopped working no damage to product not even a scratch but out of thin air it stopped working.,4
The audio quality is very good and noise reduction improves sound quality further. The cable used is too thin and not sure how long it lasts in Indian weather condition and handling. I really liked my Samsung and Motorola ear phones as the the cables were rugged. It is a good product which can be made better to last long.,4
Application hang many times..,4
Everything nice but little more disappointed this product but money worth for this product,4
Battery backup Is less,4
Good features for the price of comes in,4
"I suggest mi band to introduce the feature of knowing oxygen percentage in our bloid(saturation), since at same offer price some other companies are havibg it.And I think that it can't track the sleep during day time, bcoz I did n't find that and I suggest all buyers to purchase screenguard also...along with it any hiw nice product from MI",4
So good so far. Sound quality is great. Found it as expected. Cannot expect more at this price.,4

"Sound quality is just ok (No Bass), not at par with MI basic earphone, available at the equal price. But yes it comes with good build quality and 1 year warranty which MI doesn't offer. Bought because it is a Indian company.",4
Problem with syncing with app,4
"Very good in quality nice camera

Did not find the cable organiser as shown on the package,4

Easy to install using the wizard option. Good signal.,4

It's looks good but once after using a 2 days I had noticed that my menu screen is not scrooling and some of the apps are not opening i thought there is a problem and I just switch off and turn on then it is working good.

Reasonable price.",4
It was a gift for my hubby and he loved it. Screen was awesome. Many features for reasonable price. Tq....,4
Littlebit over priced but overall good product,4
Not worthy of money 💰,4
Sleep tracking works fine it even tracks my naps(during the daytime) battery life is approximately 5-6 days in full fledge use... Few software updates and it would be the best band to buy at this price..!! :),4
"Very nice product, it was stopped working after 3months. Replaced the product with tp link service Center",4
the watch is good features are ok . However the msg notification not working for other social app other than whatsapp. Mobile app could include more screen designs and also include self customise option. Touch screen is flawless. Battery backup is good. Loved the product.,4
Poor pictures and videos. Very slow and hangs.,4
The product is good but the features are less and the touch sensitivity is not upto to the mark. I expected a better product at this price range.,4
"I have been using TPlink 300 Mbps Router for more than 5 years. Recently it started to give inconsistent connectivity and considered Archer C6 as an upgrade. Installation was pretty much straight forward and easy. Just keep your internet service provider account details and password ready before commencing the installation.
# Awesome speed if it is in line-of-sight at about 20 to 30 feet. I could get 144 Mbps Upload and 124 Mbps Down load speed. I use ACT direct FTH link.
# Speed drops by 75% to 85% for devices located just a floor above. Hence, landed up using TP-Link repeaters. Yet could not see much improvement.
# Dual channel setup works fine
# Lots of You tube content available to catch up any specific configurations. Like I used the old Router to setup as a WDS bridge.
# Happy with the purchase and price paid for it.
# 3 stars as it did not really meet the requirements for extended connectivity between floors. If I consider for a single floor connectivity - it deserves 5 stars and more!",4
The mobile is cool,4
They are really comfortable.,4
Best product in this price 😅.,4
"Good product.Excellent product ,

No more already dead",4

"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 As you can see in the video, the screen of the watch is lighting up on its own after every few seconds, even after resetting it a couple of times. This is very irritating. How can this be rectified?",4
Absolutely perfect. Worth enough to buy at this price. Mic is the only issue. Have to speak much louder.,4
Best headphone 🎧 in 800 good ..but more than 30 mins listening in headphones 🎧 burning ears..this item..,4
Good product but just after I bought the price reduced. So you may wait see the price variations and buy based on that.,4
"My broadband plan's bandwidth is 200 mbps. I have a Mi router whose output was 30 mbps only. I heard about gigabit routers and purchased this TPLink one. Installation and configuration is quite easy. Configured dual wifi networks separately as my FireTV isn't working on 5GHz. The 2GHz continues to give 30 mbps and 5GHz is giving 90 mbps. This 5GHz network is better than my previous router's output. The experience with this bandwidth is close to what you experience in office while attending online meetings. However, I expected even better speeds being a gigabit router.",4
"Normal there have no loud bass. But if manually control the sound quality, then it gives better bass...",4
Good so far and meets purpose for supply change over with no interuption,4
"First of all, Samsung Smart phone with decent features for 5k is worth purchasing. Mostly suits for elders who uses less number of apps. Phone became dead in just 1 day but replaced with a new phone with amazon's return policy. Overall satisfied with the performance & phone look and feel.",4
"Speakers are good, sound quality is clear and good, subwoofer bass is also average, can't compare with good bass level like sony
BT connectivity is good
Negative feedback is: 1st wires are small for all speakers, 2nd while woofer is totally powerd of and turned on again, need to re select the mode like aux,dvd ,bt every time. and also volume configuration need to do every time.",4
Awesome product..if u r a bass lover then .. undoubtedly go for it...I gave it 4star coz...if u ware it for 1½ to 2 hrs...then it..can Couse pain in the ears...for this range of price...it is negligible,4
Felt a bit heavy,4
"These are a decent pair of earphones that come at such a low price point. There are few pro's and con's.
---PRO'S---
1.Stylish looking
2.Good audio quality
3.Cable has decent length
4.Good microphone

---CON'S---
1.Earbuds are kind of small (Even the extra buds are not big enough). Due to this they feel loose but doesn't fall out.
2.Build quality is of cheap plastic as expected at this price range.
3.The bass is a little weak.
4.The cable feels thin and fragile.

Conclusion: Good pair of earphones for price range, but much better earphones are available at slightly higher price range. 7/10",4
Good product from Amazon giving more band width even at time connected to multiple devices,4
Battery hitting,4
The ink gets dry if doesn't used for more than a week. Please take at least 2-3 pages print .,4

It's works perfect loud music with clear sound",4
Nice sounds,4
Been using this for almost 1 year. Found no problems with it. The only issue is that when it is turned off from the main power source you need to restart it from the power button given in the back of router otherwise this product is good to use.,4
I received it And got a small issue in its right side volume rocker. But its ok. Now about 4 months running but I got no further issues. But the,4

Build quality is as not as expected. Sound is average too. I think mi basic would a better choice.,4
Very nice 👌,4
Not working absolutely,4

"Can't ask for more in this price range. It does its job, sleep tracking is extremely useful.
Battery goes way too long, 2months for me. You may get addicted to it, putting it for 24hrs.",4
price was lower than what i visited all online market,4
"The product came on time and it is okay and prints good but the only issue I have is it show printer is offline sometimes when connected through WiFi
The scan quality could improve , I have been using the printer for a month now and ink is still at just below full capacity. Overall a good product but I think there is room for improvement 😊",4
superb sound,4
Nice phone and battery back up is good but its 6000mah battry thats y mobile thickness is more then of normal phone and its bulky also otherwise phone is good and durable,4
"It does it's job pretty good for it's price, 2.4ghz works amazingly good, 5ghz is ok, it has less range as expected, as 5ghz dense waves don't cross obstacles properly, there was a slight connectivity issue on 80mhz with my OnePlus 6, so I had to use 5g at 40mhz channel width, and it's working like a charm.",4
"Product quality is very good, value for money...hope this will give better experience in future...",4
"As a monitor, have nothing to complain at all. Looks elegant and have nice picture quality.

The only thing I did not like are the in-built speakers which are very poor quality and also too low in volume. I did not expect deep bass, but at least the voice/treble should have been louder. We can watch news or likewise on youtube, when sitting within 3 feet of monitor, but not further. And not suitable at all for music or movies. I take one star off for the poor speakers.

The brightness intelligence feature: The sensor captures direct/directional light falling on it, and not room ambient light. My room is such that the room light (LED tube light) is directly behind me, and a slight shadow falls on the monitor's light sensor, such that the monitor thinks the room is darker than it really is, and dims the brightness. So finally, had to keep the sensor auto brightness feature off.",4
"Speed obtained in 5Ghz mode is 89mbps download and 98mbps upload. In 2.4Ghz, Upload-53Mbps/ Download-48.8Mbps. This is on a 100mbps connection. Customer support is excellent.
Have given 4 star only because of range. While my earlier router D Link 605L used to cover most of the parts of the 1100sqft Appt, the range with this router hardly goes beyond 20m from the area where it is placed. Earlier router was placed in exactly the same location. I had to buy a range extender additionally.",4
"Review using after three months ..
Good working ,but not replace remote",4
Good product and quality is very best .but attache to mobile in app..,4
very good above my expectation,4
"But i had return it because i had purchase Creative too,
I had to choose one in between, I wanted to retain INFINITY that, but other people said me to return and retain Creative, But Truly i say both was good but INFINITY was little bit better that creative, in that particular 2.1 speakers. in that 4000/- around range. it is very difficult to find what was better in both but experts, and sound lover can observe the true quality of speakers. I would say INFINITY is good, in that range 2.1 speakers around 4000/- range.",4
It's bass quality is very nice and Bluetooth device is very powerful.,4
"I was looking for a backup due to frequent power cuts, even i have power backup in society but every time router was disconnecting and reconnecting which was causing issue in my work and that got resolved with this device, I haven’t tested the full backup yet but it works well and the installation is pretty simple, thanks",4
"Cam is not as expected.overall 3 out of 5
Good for only medium users.finger print aslo average.bettery life is not as expected",4
"It has been 5 months of using this phone so I will suggest you to read my review carefully. At first when I got this from amazon I thought that it was a wrong decision of choosing this phone as it was little bit slow in opening apps and all but after 1-2 updates it became really good, if want a phone on the perspective of camera then this is not for you because you doesn't get awesome but a decent camera, it is very highly recommended for students as it's battery life and charging is awesome you will also get a good audio quality dual speaker and full hd screen big display the thing which I hated the most in this phone is the fingerprint reader which rarely get unlock in the very first attempt that's why I use password and face lock in my phone.",4
This is a good printer,4
"I received this watch as a gift from my Dad and i am loving it. It has a large enough screen unlike most of the other watches in this price range.

I liked it's cool AMOLEDdisplay,4
"Camera controls should be added
All in all its is a satisfactory products
And I recommend that people should buy it
But by update watch app user interface should be made better",4
Have been using this for a month now. It very easy to setup using the tether app. Signal strength is very good within the same floor. Strength decrease significantly on different floor(like in a duplex house and zero signal if it has to pass more than 2 walls on the other floor) . Extender is necessary to get full signal in a duplex house.,4
Call Ring not available only vibration.. And answering isnt possible.. Wrist wakeup is liitle late,4
"Awesome product
I'm using this product since one month. No complain. Rich look and this grey color feels like an apple watch. Straps are really smooth and of great quality. You can use it while swimming too as the company claims it has IP68 water proofing.
Overall the watch is great. Loving it. 😊",4
"Installation is not an easy task, Driver provided by HP is not supported in PC having windows 8.1, additionally it required Microsoft.NET framework for fully operational. After that again having some issue of USB port.",4
At times this product gives static sound but overall value for money..,4
Please note this doesnot have any USB port as some of the reviews suggest. This is a downgrade from the previous version of c20.,4
Thank you amozon. Nice product,4
Product is genuine and in good condition,4
"The charger is so cheap. What's the purpose of it being a charger if it can't even hold the device properly? Previous Mi Bands had great chargers, but this is one is just ridiculous. The band looks great with all its features, but what use is it if you can't even charge your device like it's supposed to be?

I'd advise anyone against this band, just because of its charger.",4
Sounds quality is average,4
They are very Good.. It's been almost a year since my purchase and the sound quality is still the same.. I loved them ❤❤,4
Good Router but the signal level differs from place to place or else everything is fine.,4
"Bass lovers Wil simply love it
Superb bass
Bluetooth pairing and playing is flawless
The Equalizer work only in pendrive mode and FM mode
Would have been great if it had a treble switch on the remote
Clarity is a little bit on the lower side..however we can always adjust with the Equalizer of smartphone or laptop or the in built Equalizer depending on the source input.....I really love the product...under 4000 not much of complaints",4

Good quality. Value for money. Printing cost too high due to cartridges.,4

Easy to install but signal is low,4
Quite nice product. Good sound quality and material . It gets a bit warm if used for a longer period of time. Overall good product u should buy it if u have no problems with wires.,4
"Im going to give a small comparison of this product with two of the headphones i have been using recently.
This includes Samsung level u ( rs 2249/) and the ant audio w56 in ear wired earphone ( rs 599/)
Pros
Decent build quality
Excellent sound quality
Apt for watching movies.
Soft cushioning
Mic
Good quality cable
Cons
External noices creeps in a lot ( less noice cancellation effect).
Jack is not gold plated, but I won't complain about it because the gold plating on most of the jacks of headphones in this price range will wear off after a months usage.

On comparing the boat bass heads 900 with the ones mentioned above, I noticed that the bass levels were pretty much equal between the ant audio w56 and boat bass heads 900. Samsung level u has the least bass compared to the other 2
In terms of audio quality, the boat bass heads and Samsung level u are in the same level, the clarity of sound is a bit less in the ant audio w56 compared to the boat .
For outdoor use, I would prefer the ant audio w56 as it has better noice cancellation compared to the boat.
Comfort
I have read some reviews complaining about the boat bass heads 900 that it pains in the ears after a few minutes of usage. But I have not experienced such problems.
Build quality
The plastics used is not the best, but acceptable. Ear pads are well cushioned.
Summary
Overall a really decent product from boat, excellent sound clarity and good bass makes it good for watching movies. Most suitable for indoor usage, good value for money ( bought it for 799 but will be available for 599 at certain times.)
Audio quality 4/5
Bass 3.8/5
Value for money 4/5
Comfort 4/5
Build quality 3.7/5
Thank you for your time.",4

Very nice product...got it delivered in under 20 hours... scarlet red colour is just awesome..compared to note 8..it should have been a glass back...but the provided quality is also very good.. consumer who has not used glass back would definitely find it awesome..camera and other things are good..got miui 12 update just after setting up the phone,4

"Easy to configure , best feature we can block users in the wifi through the mobile app. But the range is as normal router",4
Of course very easy to install and use . Pls buy this only if you print around 100 pages per year . If you print more then go for laser jet or any other printer which dont use ink cartridges like this printer which costs you more than the printers MRP.,4
Good sound quality and battery but bass is not good,4
In this phone note a fingerprint scanner,4
"It's a nice watch with all the features one can need.

It keeps you updated with all you need.

"I was using a Belkin G series router for home DSL internet. But, becuase of slow wireless speed(54MBPS), the playing recorded videos in my phone through Google Chromecast was not possible(buffering was very slow).
This router has solved the problem as the network speed is exceptionally high. Also, the coverage area of wireless is almost as good as my previous Belkin router. Plus, this router can act as a repeater if you need.
The drawback I see is that it does not have a guest Wifi password option.
But within the specified price range, this is a good router.",4
The monitor is great. Very accurate colours. Do note that the product has a 16 A plug instead of a 6 A plug. I had to get a 16A socket installed in my room because I didn't know this earlier. But not a big deal. It's totally worth it.,4
Best phone for this money,4
"Getting Little noise at peak sounds and beats, but feels light when put on and bass is at right level for the ears for long time of usage. The jbl signature can be experienced.",4
I gifted it to my Dad and he loved it !,4

Superb..,4
Boat bass heads earphones.Aggressively price expensive product not wortfull found much better sound in this price dont buy this earphone,4
if any looking for Budget Band this is best band. Tons of watchfaces and 3rd party apps support for google maps navigation. only drawback is Sleep tracking in not that accurate compared with Honor Band 5 else this was fantastic choisce.,4
"The quantity of the band is good.
But the charger is of very poor quality.
Disappointed ☹️☹️☹️",4
"Vivo v11 pro phone .
app is not working properly
Band is when app closing then discounted the band",4
"The watch is fine for the price; but, to get the accessories of this brand is a real task. Have faced the same problem for the noise color fit pro and pro 2. The charger of the previous watch had stopped working after a year; so I needed a new charger but it wasn't available anywhere however hard I tried; and the watch without a charger is useless. The same goes with the noise color-fit pro 2 after I purchased it after the previous watch. The charger is so small that it got misplaced in the house work. I cannot buy another ""original charger"" since noise doesn't keep their accessories easily available. So in this case, I got to use my watch only for 6 months since I do not want to risk my watch battery by using a duplicate charger available. Noise needs to keep their accessories as well, easily available on their website. It only shows sold out every time you visit their website and is never available once the product is more than a year old. What is the point of buying from this brand in that case? NOISE PLEASE FIX THIS! At least request you to keep your chargers and important accessories available!!",4
I used that the product was quite good. There are at affordable price. I like RAM and ROM it was nice 4-64 quality of display is quite poor than the other samsung galaxy phone. There no compass option in this phone. I thought it was bigest feedback of this product. And the quality of camera is poor,4
"Finger print is super easy useable
battery life is super
camera quality is super",4
"I bought this for my mother and I would say its a good one. My mother uses it only for making calls and playing games and the battery is excellent. She uses it the whole day and by the end of the day the battery remains in 75%.

If you are a light user or planing to buy it for your parents or someone who doesn't spend all their time in mobiles, then its a go to mobile.",4
This mobile phone is very osm and value of money but camera pixel size is normal and camera shooting pic is not good.,4

Good.,4
The plastic broke after using fourth time and the company representatives mention that it is normal wear and tear. Communicated with the company and awaiting for their answer to decide whether I can throw it or will they provide the plastic case for extra money.,4
Sleep tracking is not working at all. Even if you sleep for more than 3 hours it shows no nap data. Its been 3 days and my data is 0. Is there any way I can get it replaced.,4
"Some-times Display blinks/comes lines, why it happens can't judge that it's display have problem or Motherboard have problem..",4
A great product and a good price,4
Good one. Does the job well. No problems so far after 1 month of usage.,4

Selfie camera is not good,4
"Product is value for money. But it takes almost 2.30 hours to fully charge though we are all expecting technology that technology is advancing and there should be quick charging feature, which is not but same, similar like the old ones.",4
Bass is very high.. mids and highs are not upto the mark. But for the price it is good . Value for money.,4
Great product.enjoy using it.good battery life .water proof .easy to use with android mobile app.go for it.heart beat monitoring quite accurate,4
"Zero star worthy!!
No support from Amazon or from Mi.. check your product activation date as soon as you got delivery of any Mi product. Go to Mi official website register for a appointment with nearby Mi service center and go there on said date and time and ask them to check product activation date. If it is before ur billing date then u hav received already used and activated product. Return immediately and give Amazon a nice lecture!! Because I am writing this review as I got directly affected by those issues!! My smart band is dead.. No YouTube idea also worked!!",4
"Everything is okay.
But the Amazonians have given the cartridges which are almost empty and which were open i had to buy those things new",4
Good prodoct....,4
"So far having good experience.. superb camera,
But why redmi not providing a headset",4
WiFi signal is good,4
Good product.Sound quality is like local made earphones not worth full brand to buy,4
"The sleek router UPS is very useful and an very easy DIY to install. Very much helpful, if only your area has frequent powercuts while working or have important client meetings. The UPS seemlessly allow you to continue work even after power failure. Initial testing gave me around 4 hours as described.
Long term raliability is bit concern (as read some reviews, but will add more after my personal experience - after 6 month use )
It could have been much cheaper, around 1000 to 1500; but it is only product that you can see on amazon with good review..",4
"Nice watch, color, and good battery backup",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Very improved version compare to HRX edition (I have previously)
Also a reasonable upgrade compare to MiBand 3
If you compare with Hinor band 5 both are almost same. But battery life is better in Mi Band 4.
Honor band 5 has feature of remote photo clicking which is not available in Mi Band 4.",4
GOOD PRODUCT. I LIKE IT.,4

Camera need update...",4
Good one. But expected better Range.,4
The watch is good with decent features and build quality but touch response is bad.,4
"Based on the price tag, this mobile is a good choice. Except the quality of pictures, other features are good and worth buying. Especially suitable for the age bracket more than 50....",4
Value for money around 26-27k,4
I liked the features of this watch and charging part like it remains for a week then we also get a notification of messages and calls.,4
Watch is very nice and tracking all the data properly.you can go fro this if you are looking for low price smart watch with all the tacking features.,4
"Got it just for 450, sound and bass quality is great but the built quality is not that good, but yes this the best anyone can get @ Rs.450 . i think its the best budget earphone anyone can get and if you are planning to buy one, just go for it.",4
"Simple superb quality, working well, looking good",4
Quality is good in the price range below Rs 7000 battery does not last long and camera captured quality will be ok if you are looking for high quality camera or high battery back up you need to buy higher version model in higher price segment,4
Must have to purchase screen protector for this band.. otherwise it's risky.,4
"A VERY GOOD PRODUCT.
THE SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD
THE BATTERY LIFE IS FANTASTIC",4
I ordered these because my bass heads 225 stopped working and honestly i was worried because this says baas heads 100 but other than the build quality i didn't feel any difference the bass is a bit less when compared to the 225 but you will get used to it. I'm pretty impressed.,4

"It's very good product, I using every day sound quality is good noise cancellation is above average bass quality is good",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Good product .. but still having a doubt as per the details given in the box we should charge it with 5v250ma charger but it's not provided with the box nor the mobile phone charger is above 1 A usually. And it's not available in the Amazon. Could have given the specified charger along with the smart band.I don't know whether it is harmful for the device by charging it with 1 A Charger. Otherwise the smart band is so nice good display ,nice features, and so much.",4
Easy to install our end..Good for 2 BHK area wide ..Range..,4
Battery life gud,4
Superb kwality,4
"I'm very satisfied with this product. It fits comfortably, the sound quality is exquisite for this price range. Definitely worth buying, thanks to Amazon for highlighting this headphone in the suggestion pane. Cheers!!",4
Good router. Was able to set it up in a jiffy but the network signal is not as strong as I was expecting. Its definitely better than the earlier single antenna Netgear router that I was using but not as good as would have liked it to be. I dont get all 5 bars even in next room. Still not completely dissatisfied as I am getting decent network in my entire 2 BHK flat and price for this product was very low.,4

"This router Tp c1200 is very good in terms of speed and range, but its old now. Within same price point we can get upgraded model ""TP link MR 3620"" from same seller itself. MR 3620 has more speed in addition you can use 4g/3g dongle as well as normal cable internet. Look and wifi range wise both model are same. Make sure you take from Appario seller.",4

Nic smart look .,4
"at this price range this is the best option. So,go for it!!!!",4
I product was good but I feel like i made a mistake becoz at Same price of 100 series thier was 162 at same price but meanwhile this product was also good but quality of earphone can not justify it's price and if you want to buy this earphone plz check out some higher varients as 152 or 162 or 225 at the time of sale the prices of all these product came to same price.,4
"Its totally seller's fault i got a broken seal and used product,

"Slim, classic and elegant watch",4
"Product is very nice...its not too loud which after some time starts shooting pain in ears....but build quality of wire is lil bit not as expected..should have been better.
All n all soundwise...very nice product",4
Value for money. Nice fit and finish,4
Its comfortable and nice,4
"Even though at my home the generator kicks in after few min, the product stopped working exactly after 18months. The battery charging unit should be little more intelligent to avoid overcharging individual cells. There is no replacement option to change the batteries.",4
Damn its good,4
Ihih,4

Range is good",4
"1. Easy to setup.
2. I got it replaced quickly as the first product bought was deemed corrupt by the TPlink tech. had no problems with replacing and tracking.
3. Comes in tidy non damaged packing than before. Amazon India has finally made amends.
4. Can control a lot and monitor from the app which is good.
5. Serves the purpose of dual bandwidth though I still find 5Ghz band connecting to only certain smartphones.
6. Very minuscule loss of speed in wifi (15mbps/6devices all playing HD video at once no latency issues in wifi connected gaming). No loss though ethernet RJ cable to PC.

But yes need better clarity on how to connect the devices which do not recognise 5Ghz Bandwidth.
Pls, lemme know if any of you know how to.",4
I am using it as a repeater and performance so far has been stable. It was easy to setup and coverage also decent. The antenna is not removable .,4
"at this price this is a superb printer ordinary nothing exceptional , but at this price this is the best you can get. quality is good, colours are vibrant, and the size is very egronomical. the only downside is that it seems to use up too much ink. if you are looking for home use and you are on a budget, go for it",4
I won’t say the Best Buy but probably a good one in this price range. The accuracy of monitoring is great. If your budget is 2500 then this is a great watch to buy.,4
Noise fit mobile application got hanged in the last update not able to retrieve the previous data and newly installed again. Sleep tracking is good. If Temperature sensor is also installaed then it would have been great.,4
I really impressed with the build quality of the mi band 5. But I have given it 4 stars because as the company promise that the band has 14 days of battery capacity but it just 7-8 days of battery life hardly. I really very dissatisfied with this.☹️,4
Working is gud but belt/strap quality is very bad and when i connected to mobile it's accuracy is slitly decreased.. They should look after better quality of display.,4
Sleep tracking is nice but not buy band 4 buy band 5,4
Wi-Fi speed super,4

1. Face watch degital screen is not much good.",4
Product is really amazing its look nice and work well good product is good cost,4
Good product bit model is obselete in the market is what I came to know. Very easy to install & it’s plug and play type. There is no CD along with for installation & ths drivers could be downloaded online. Depends on the system config is takkrion process becomes easy. For windows 10 it takes few minutes but other system it might take a few minutes. But print & product quality is excellent & worth buy for a house. Reccomend this product for sure.,4
"Amazing speakers, wish it came with treble and bass control though",4
Good Item compared to other headphone.,4
"Quality of sound is Quite good. Noise cancellation is also good. Battery life is amazing. It should have been over ear, its not that comfortable to listen to music long time with this headsets. The ears start paining after some time.",4
Its Very Good Product.,4
Very nice product..go for it,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Excellent picture quality @6300. Comes with AMD FREESYNC for tearing free gaming. I'm satisfied with 60Hz.",4

Well function.,4
Laptop is decent but adapter is getting heated up abruptly in 5 minutes.,4
Its a good watch at this price range. The bluetooth connectivity is not that amazing and sometimes disconnects. And I do not get a notification when it disconnects.,4
Overall good product And comfortable in ears,4
"Read a lot of reviews about its strong wireless coverage but the coverage takes a back seat once there is a wall in between. The more the number of walls the less will be the coverage. Apart from that, there is nothing much to talk about this modem. Its a regular modem & router.",4
"It is average headphone , the wire is very thin so you have to be very careful, I would suggest jbl c150i than buying this .",4
Very good ....very easy to configure and ready to use,4

3. Functional watch have 60+ sports mode,

4. Battery is average upto 7 day (depends on your usage)",4
Package was received on time and the item was well packaged. It is easy to install and looks good. I did have a wifi modem (Asianet D2 wifi modem) without antenna and idea behind the purchase was to increase the range. After connecting this router I don't see any change in the signal strength which is a bit disappointing. It is worth if you are buying it in a lightning deal. 3 star for the product + 1 star to Amazon for prompt delivery.,4
I think its value for money!!,4
"Good product, but wire quality is slight different from my old hade phone same model.",4
Nice printer,4
"Works well, it's a good piece, battery lasts 9-11 days for me. Good to manage notifications. Could have done a better job by improving the accuracy of the steps counter. Other than that it's worth the money.",4
It's an amazing product. Jbl Hatsoff.,4
Good phone for those who are moving from feature phones. Display is perfect size and easy to hold as well. Battery life could've been slightly better. Thanks!,4

Good... Basic model,4
Not something extraordinary as advertise. But it's a good product within this price range.,4
"Best in class battery life
It is a little bigger than I expected but it can be folded which is useful to carry along in my backpack. It has good noise cancellation and soft cushions help with isolation as well.
Good bass and sound clarity even at full volume doesn't sound tinny or sound doesn't distort.
Has similar performance and even better performance that some of the other expensive brands that cost 8-10K.",4
Best phone in this budget but screen is not so smooth for touch.,4
Good for regular use,4
"Bluetooth connectivity- good
Volume controls- good
Aux- good
Controls- average
Comfort- below average (it felt extremely tight. And after long use ear hurts)
Built - average",4

"Like:
1. The phone size is handy.
2. The light sensor is good and fast.
3. Camera quality is good.

Dislike:
1. The battery port and headphone port are provided at the bottom, so I have to hold the mobile in hand, in case it is charging and google meet call is going on.
2. The 'do not disturb' tab is missing.",4
"This was a gift for my mother who wanted something that would fit her lifestyle and help monitor everyday health information. She loved that it's light weight and packed with features, especially that it is iOS compatible and has SPO2 tracking. It has worked well so far however suddenly stopped last night. I'm in the process of registering for warranty and would update here how this pans out. She really loves it and wishes we can get it fixed or replaced asap.",4
"Cartridge ha to be changed timely and is costly, ink dries up within 2 days",4
The incoming calls notification doesn't always work. It's bothersome while traveling. Don't know whether it's application issue or the band's. Please do fix it. ( FYI I've checked all the possible setting and configuration to rule out problem from my side),4
Video quality is not so good as expected overall experience is great,4
"One of the best product, sound quality is excellent 👌👌 ,best price 799",4
Good product for the pricing,4
Not more comfortable for ears,4
Nice product but hanging issues,4
Mobile app: very less watch faces,4
When video mode is on camera have no push option to push the video recording,4
"The watch is really nice. Built quality is decent, Dafit app works perfectly and gives you option for good watch faces. The best part is its accuracy and battery life. The vitals measurement is good along with SpO2 monitor. Battery lasts for 20 days atleast when you use it constantly. I recommend to get this and its value for money.",4
"The brand is Sony so quality is impeccable. But sound output is less, lesser than earphones. Well cushioned n extendable fit but not snug fit at ears. My son liked them.... Just worth the price.",4
worth the prize though there are cons too.,4
"Over all the phone is ok but the catching power of network and internet is little bit lees ,some problem were faced in low strength areas",4
"Its very loud, bass is good at mid level of volume. Good at listening at mid volume level. All in all good at 1500 K",4
Amazing display. Love the view angles and price point,4
They want to improve camera and display.,4
"Sleep tracking is absolutely accurate, I like it.",4
The band is good as expected but i don't understand why Xiaomi keeps REDUCING THE VIBRATION LEVEL .... that's disappointing and also it is a color display and still NOT showing EMOJIS....... I DIDN'T LIKE THESE,4
Good but can be better,4
This is the best smartwatch in this price..you cannot expect more than this.. go on,4
Nice feature and value for money,4
"Packaging is Not good.
No Double Box Covered.
Received little scratches on box.
Product is Fine Quality.

Being a Prime Member..I feel disappointed.

I think, Now a Days Amazon not giving importance to Packaging. I received last few products from Amazon with poor Packaging.
In the beginning all the products from Amazon were recieved with well Package. (With double boxes) but now is a question mark.

When i received the product (Last Few Products) i have doubt on myself, am i Prime member of Amazon?

I trust Amazon..
With the hope of receive product with good Packaging in future.",4
So far running awesome. Clear sound and useful for single room,4
"Pros:
Display
Detection

Stress and spO2 works but take it with pinch of salt

Cons:
I had a weird issue , i had 45% and when i restarted watch it became 52%
Can be fixed with OTA update
Nothing else",4

Music player next and previous not working...and BP measurements are incorrent,4
Viewing angles are good...it's so bright and great quality...,4
"Display is great.

Battery backup is quite low and the noise fit app really need improvement. Also pls include microsoft teams app in notification list. If GPS feature is added in feature, to track the excercise that will be a will be a great value.",4

Screen quality nd battery life is good,4
Colour print is averagr,4
"Bass and beats is average in by mode ,otherwise during wired it's better.No active noise cancellation,not even passive,😂",4
Good one at best price.......,4
"I have said it time and again in my 30+ reviews of earphones and headsets, all this Extra Bass, Deep Bass and True Bass is a CAPACITY and not a Feature. You need a good media device to get that quality sound from the headset. It is like have a wifi router with a long range, it doesn't matter how far away from the router you can access the wifi if you have trash internet. This product is really good for the price, you get overall great sounds from this, I would recommend it to anyone with a tight budget.",4
👌,4
Awesome display looks like premium phone 6mb Ram is fast no heating issues faced. Over all a good phone for this price. Little heavy and camera is just normal,4
"Happy with sound quality, but the plastic body puts me in doubt how long it may lost. The bulkey size irks. Bought mainly for the built-in radio. Feels bad for reading micro SD card you have to remove and reinsert in the slot every time. Chances for loosing the card on is high.",4
Sleep tracking not functioning properly,4
"I charged it fully on March 4th and tbe battery ran out on March 13th. It was running on full stretch with heart rate monihor on always etc.
I think its good battery backup. 9 days is pretty good.",4
Sound Quality is good. Adjusting volume through the air buds is tricky and can mislead as if the buds are malfunctioning.,4
"No Screen Guard & Phone Cover With The Phone.
You Get Both These Items With The Phone, But Someone Took Them From The Box",4
Nice sound clarity and worth the price,4
No hd display. But ok,4
Airbuds sound quality is very good,4
"I got these in September , but recently it stopped working properly .
The sound from right earbud has completely stopped. Since these are in warranty , can i get a replacement for this product.",4
Fit and finish can be a bit better. But accuracy of tracking is good.,4

Super.Good product,4
I have been using since Oct 2017. Still this headphone works fine. Sound quality is good and comes with good quality and tangle free cable. I can see that other users are complaining for low sound but in my opinion sound volume is sufficient and satisfactory for listening music.,4
Good product. Very nice and sleek looking.,4
Its very nice its result also good I just like ...,4
Great.good quality with excellent work and good price,4
Sound slightly improved but..,4
Low price and best Bass quality Remote has more functions can also control the subwoofer bass fm is too good,4

Avista smart watch.Dont buy this it has low volume speaker and microphone and battery was getting  completed in 2 hours,4
"I bought it in Dec2018. Product is good. But after 8 months One Ear stop functioning. If such things happen then what is the difference between branded product and local product available @ just Rs 50/-
There is one year warranty but there is no adequate guidance given to process the request.
Please help.",4
It is worth the cost at which the product is being offered.,4
"For gaming, Bluetooth is causing a little delay of 70ms , which is ok.But we can use aux Cable send by them, with no delay. Good for causal listening. Soft, comfortable design.

The problem is with aux Cable. It is little damaged from inside, causing turning off of left speaker. This happens rarely and can be correct just by pulling out aux from device and putting it in again.

Aux Cable is cheaper",4
Nice product but stress monitor is not working,4
I loved it,4
"Good product as per the price
Very good phone a middle class",4
"Fast connection and pairing. Stable connection (I tested it at about 5 meters). Sound is clear and well balanced. Bass is not too high nor too low. Audiophiles and bass freaks (like myself) may not like it.

But overall a fairly good pair of headphones.",4
Good product but speaker wire so short,4
Sometimes need to restart the router to get internet connection.,4
Worth spending. Fullfill all smart watch needs. The battery life is excellent.,4

"Bought this produce couple of months ago. Still works as new. I almost keep this thing turn on for a day straight. Nothing changes with its capability, performance etc.., Thank You Amazon.",4
"The new Mi Band 4 is really amazing. Although it gives all the features with other bands give such as heart rate tracking, sleep tracking, steps counter, waterproofing till 50 m, coloured display, etc, the features I most liked is the 20 days battery backup, multiple and customised watch faces, and an integrated music player.
The UI is really good and the gives a seamless motion in operating. The band comes with a comfortable and premium quality rubber band which doesn't itches on the skin. Also, the band is really light and doesn't feels that it's there on the hand most of the times. The accuracy is good too.
The Mi Fit app is also good and gives you the control on the band such notification display, watch face, etc but I personally believe that the UI of the could have been better.
The another good thing which I also liked about the band is that you can have customised vibration pattern for notifications, alarm, call, etc.
Overall the band is really good for the given price and gives a worth of it.",4
Very good product from sony but sound not soo loud everage sound but very crystal clear and bass also very good 👌👌,4
"Awesome product in that prise range.. Battery back 10 out of 11 and over all product will be 8 outof 10
Really awesome product.. Thanks amazon..",4
I had gifted to someone he said to me this is awesome handfree with nice bass & sound quality.,4
"Could have given 5 start but the router doesn't have mesh routing.. if this router gets firmware update and mesh routing comes along I will definitely give 5 star , but overall nice product . I thought of replacing with mesh router because I already have one but no return available in this .",4
It is good for money,4
The product is decent but accuracy is not that good,4
Nice the boat,4
Good earphones with nice sound quality. Bass and treble optimized. Good for listening music / watching movies for an hour or so. There after the pressure on the ears makes it difficult to use.,4

I can't get my money back....... I been using sony and LG... First time tried Acer and I have to suffer for this monitor.,4
Value for money... stays put... doesn't plop out of the ears!,4
This is worth for money and working fine..,4
"After using it for more than
4-5 months; it is still the same!
Very good sound quality, bass, it is also foladable
Value for money! But is hurts after wearing it for more than 1 hour",4
Amazing headphones... They have some really nice sound quality. They are simply amazing and not too expensive as well as compared to the high end ones. They were for around ₹500,4
"After reading many negative reviews was a bit worried whether the selection of this model was good or bad.
But after getting in hand, I can say really 100% that it's a worth for those who don't use smartphones much in detail like camera and all,
Feature wise it's a good phone at a nominal price.
Operating is good, camera a bit ok ok.

Overall rating will be ""Good""",4
"Touch quality not bad need better quality
apart from that everything ok",4
Like this product very much,4

Very easy to install and use,4
"Easy to Install but Signal strength has to be improved. I have installed this in my Ground floor but signals are not coming on First floor.
This is little bit disappointing.
Rest all good",4
"Product is very easy to install. If you print on glossy paper you will get as per your expectations. But if you print on normal paper, it will print average. But it is a great thing right? So that only it has gotten the name 'Eco Tank' printer. Scanner is awesome. With this scanner you can get readable pdf file (not as photo), photo and normal pdf file (as a photo). It supports various types of papers. Overall, it's really good to have the printer like this at low cost compared to others in market.",4
"Nice product value for money
Perfect for CCTV",4
Best value price but some camera quality according the lens is not so good,4
"Very good quality sound. But I got right side’s ear padding detached, when received. This was first time for us to understand your procedure. Nobody advised us to send photographs. Any way please collect this defective boAt head phone and refund the full amount on priority. I would like to order fresh on receiving the refund amount",4
The product is awesome at its price range . I'm using this earphone since 7months there is no issue with anything. But there is only one problem the earbuds come out easily so you need to be careful when u are carrying it .,4

"After long search I ordered Archer C 6 during lock down.
Pros.
1.It gives good coverage in flat area abt 1850sqft with 2.4Ghz.
2.For android mi tv bok 4k gives good connection at 5Ghz.
No problem in 2 months.
3.No need of any technical support as its quite use friendly setup.

Cons.
1.As most reviewer mentioned it could not be distantly monitered using app.
2.No auto On/off.
3.long search for desi Modem but no good quality made in India product was found so ordered China made.",4
"Terrific band with tonnes of features. Absolute worth the money. The display is amazing...touch is sensitive with quick response time and the capsule feels premium in build quality.

However the strap feels ordinary and the charging unit doesn't hold the capsule well....I had to use a crocodile clip to keep it clasped to the unit.

As for the rest am not sure if you can get a better fitness band for the money.",4
Sound quality is good.. noise cancelation not that much but ok.. so 4/5 star,4
"I operate the function easily without Manual Book but bluetooth connectivity is not good because the bluetooth disconnect automatically and bluetooth range is also not good. I use this watch within 4-5 meters and I saw the bluetooth automatically disconnected. Touch is also not good, I think touch should be like a smartphone touch.",4
Printer is good and quality is same also but here is a disappointing point that its consuming so much ink for printing and wipe out the cartridge nearly for 20 to 40 pages.,4
"In this price range it's a best quality mobile. It's ok about camera and battery life is very nice
But it doesn't have finger scanner. It has face lock",4
A bit upset as the main seal on the box was already cut and VGA cable was missing. Other wise the rest of the product looks untouched. Video quality is also nice,4
"It contains almost all the feature that smart watch should have, only thing i don't like is touch, sometime it need to be pressed gently to open apps.",4
"The product is totally worth the money Built quality is also good
Active noice cancellation is not there as mentioned",4
The product is good and worth the price!,4
1ghante se jyda nhi pehn skte.its so uncomfortable.,4

"Budgeted head phone where you get good quality sound and bass, though the bass isn’t that strong still you like what you hear!!! It’s good headphone to go on.",4
"Better Look
Better performance
For Normal usage",4
Jabardast sound,4
The sound quality is very good on thses speakers. There is one thing that is really missing on thses speakers is HDMI arc connectivity you cannot connect these speakers to TV with HDMI. the aux output from the Tv is on that great. So beaware if you are buying these for TV and your tv doesn't have Bluetooth connectivity.,4
Boat earphones.Clear voice and base,4
"Very good product, loved it. Only thing is you need to buy additional connector, as the power plug(3 pin plug) doesn't fit into normal switchboard.",4
Very nice product!! Value for money,4
"I think it is a good choice , Bluetooth connectivity is very nice ,I'm reviewing after using them for 2 months ,#Really a nice product.",4
"Allover, nice product in this price range.
Giving Review after a week of use:
1. Bluetooth connectivity good, range 5 to 10metres in open place.
2. Battery backup is very nice, can't say how many hours but I'm using it from 3 day for daily 1 to 3 hours and till not needed to charge.
3. Sound Quality not good as mentioned in product. No Bass. But it's good for normal music listner.
4. Build Quality is also fair.
5. Call connects well.
6. Go for it, if u hv Less budget and no experience of high quality sound.",4
"It is a very good fitness band.
Tracking is just ok not the best but you can't expect much for 2000.

Very gud,4
"The product is awesome and should be given a try. The noise cancelling is ok the sound quality is amazing and the bluetooth connectivity is also great. I used the product to listen to songs, to do gaming.",4
Like it it have some good bass sound clarity also good. It has also noise cancellation if you have low budget then you go for it.Totally worth it. Between Sennheizer X-180 and JBL 100SI of course you will pickup Sennheizer for great Bass..Both comes with same Cost.,4
"Easy to install, great for small spaces",4
"The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the first three pages that I printed, the ink smudged across the page. That apart, I am well-satisfied with this product. My usage is not heavy but I generally end up printing between 5-10 pages per week, and this is good enough for my purpose. Linked up well with the android phone also. I don't understand why the latest app was not available in the given HP page, but as soon as I installed the printer app, it blanked out my phone and asked me to install the ""new"" plugin. I mean, where's the point of having two different plugins for the same purpose. Would have been much better to update the main app, rather than force the users to install multiple plugins.",4
Looks cool.,4
"SETUP PROCESS IS REALLY HARD & FRUSTRATING.
QUALITY IS GOOD.
PRINT QUALITY IS GREAT.
COLOUR FILLING IS EASY AND NOT MESSY.
GREAT FOR HOME USE",4
My fifth speaker not working i want replacement plz help. Overall product is excellent go for it,4

"Parcel received with nice packaging
Home theatre show Good performance .",4
Product is good. But it's charger is very loose. Band doesn't fit into charger. I get it charged by using rubber band. Charger is poor which makes it negative point of mi band 4,4
"The audio clarity is there but it has very averagw bass. The built is decent, the wires look average.",4
Camera quality better with this range,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 It's a good smart watch, worth for money",4
"Zeb thunder is the best headphones in this price range , got in only 599, you can use in dual mode wireless/ wired, sound and bass is decent, good for calling also ,2 hours charging gives 9 hours talktime

As compare with zeb zoom build quality is is better than Zeb zoom headphones

but Zeb zoom have 50 hours talktime in 2 hours of charge but compromise in term of build quality",4
It's remote is not working.. Before packing product must be checked twice..What they are doing.,4
"First thing the delivery was really fast even on the holiday (dussehra), packing was nice and secure, smart watch sleep tracking quality is good and accurate, mobile app is user friendly and covers lot of activity.
over all the quality and accuracy is good.",4

"Excellent, service from Amazon was prompt.
Product is one of the best for home use. Easy to search through Amazon helps the buyer to select the right product.",4
Touch screen is nice,4
I am using it since last 2 months. Works perfect. Not sure if the ink would last for 6000+ pages as advertised. I see already 1/4th ink used for few 100 pages. Photo print quality on glossy paper is not that great. Also no calls from Canon customer support for installation. Self installation is not easy with the given printed instruction. I did it watching some YouTube videos but it took 2-3 hours for complete setup.,4
Good quality monitor,4
Sound quality not up to the level,4
"Packing is excellent, very easy to install",4
Battery is good. Camera is not that good .. little big in size,4

I would have to buy a new card not knowing if that would work.",4
"The product was good.....

Sound quality was superb......👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

Bass was so nice....

Battery life is too good........

But only one problem..... When we use it wirelessly, the sound quality are nice as said above but if we use the aux cable, the sound was so low...... The volume is soo low compared to bluetooth.....

So I suggest to provide a good quality aux cable",4
"I always wanted an over ear headphones like this. It is very comfortable on the head, ears and also despite having a big bass system it hardly hurts the ear. Enjoying the rock classic bands from early 70s to early 90s and it's awesome. Although have used this for just few days it feels to be promising. Let's come back after few months of use for it's genuine review.",4
Good product. But charging is too slow and battery life is short. Camera quality is good.,4
"This router works well for the most of time, though we experience network drop once in a while. Good choice overall.",4
"After researching for 10 days I bought TP Link Archer C20 as it has dual band mechanism & Easy to use Application(TP-Link Teather app). After buying it i would suggest you to buy single band router to same some money.

1. SPEED :
No need of Dual Band Router if you use a broadband Plan 100mbps or less because Upto 100mbps the speed & Ping is Same to same in 2.4 & 5 GHz signal. I use Alliance 590/- Plan that is 60mbps & i get 7 mb/s in general avg speed every time I download something from Youtube,Prime videos, Netflix etc. Though is shows 56mbps in Speed test by Ookla's website.

2. PUBG Ping :
I get 30-40 ms in avg Asia server using Wifi. with my 60mbps alliance plan(rs. 590 per month) .
Coming from Jio connection PUBG runs way tooo smooth now with the basic plan.

3. Heating Issue : In the summer days it gets hot with default settings. But this heat is very acceptable as per the Room temperature.
A quick tip : Temporarily disable the 5GHz signal to reduce the heat issue. as you get same speed & Ping in both the Signal upto 100mbps plan..

If your ISP doesn't give you PPPOe username & Password use static IP as it is best for Home based router. You can easily get the details from your Computer it self by just going to Network settings , search the process on YouTube.
As some ISP charge 300 rs to install it But you can do it on your own. remember after successfully setting up the router it may not start the internet service. don't be upset just call your Internet service provider (ISP) ask them to enable the Router connection from their office.

Total cost i spend : 1000(cable installation) + 590(basic plan)+ 1599(router) + 300(router setup). i gave you tips to save (300+599) by getting a Single band router & Set up on your own.",4
Looking wise sexy like son of witch but working wise little bit worrying becouse it work fine. But low wi di range,4
on time delivery. godd product. so far no issues.,4
"Works for me. 5gz ""band"" needs newer devices though. May not work on older devices. YMMV",4
Good Performing Product,4
Worth the money. But packaging could have been little more safer in a box instead of cover.,4
I like this smart vital watch Features is Accuracy.......And I like sleep tracking also....,4
sound is best,4
All functions are working and I like this product.i am using all functions..,4
Sleep tracking is good but step recording is not accurate,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 This is a nice watch but if you want something less expensive take the boat smart watch",4
Good product but not better than Dell s2216h. I bought this monitor for 7600 from lamington road. It's brightness level cannot be adjusted to very low as Dell 21.5.,4
Good printing and scan copy,4
The earphone is quiet nice produces great sound and bass which is needed . Sound clarity is quiet good. The only problem is with its build quality which is not too good and the wire gets tangled.try to use a pouch for your earphone which makes it last longer.,4
Good for home usage and small quantity. B&W prints are good.,4
Good phone under 10k,4
The range is an issue with 5Ghz frequency... but it provides really good speed if you are in range,4
The product once set up is excellent.,4
Overall it's a good phone at economic price..,4
Good not the bestt...,4
"I m writing this review after 2 weeks of intense use of this amazing mobile.
I work online full time & have some heavy apps running for 18 hrs a day & I have found no issues with performance of this mobile.
No heating issues,
No hangups,
Full day battery backup in heavy use & 2 days under normal use.
Camera is decent.
Stereo sound is good for listening music.
Satisfied with the purchase!!!",4
Nice but improve noise cancellation,4
One of the best smart watch in this price segment.,4
Doesnt slipfrom ears like the boat bass 220. But a lower bass then that if you compare both. Sound clarity is better then many other in this price range and the noise cancellation is also apt.,4
The product is good and the print quality was superb.,4
Printer is very good and easy to install print quality also very good,4
Everything good,4
Battery is awsome and with great features 👍👍,4

My d-link router was not affected but this device blew up with small voltage fluctuation.",4
"Ithink this is the best headphone in this price category...
No bulky sound....
Clear sound,,,, go for it",4
Value for money. Be sure the check the router power rating before choosing the variant for this router backup. Haven’t had any issues.,4

"Giving approx 90% of bandwidth provided by ISP. One cannot place it on a wall. Only table top router.

To get max output, I turned of 2.4 ghz band and using only 5ghz band.
And also using dhcp rather than PPPoE connection to avoid additional overhead and logging into ISP via browser everytime.

It is a ""Made In China"" product.",4

Boat rockers headphone are excellent,4
Very good modem for normal use. Even though it is not 'ac',4
Good product.Nyc very good product,4
Dislike is... That when ever I restart my watch it takes 10 to 15 minutes to connect with mobile. Battery Backup is also not so good you have to charge once in two days.

We should not expect 100% accuracy at this price point.

Battery life is awesome- charges to full in 20 mins since I do it every weekend eventhough it's at 45-50%
Breathing excercise assistant is awesome.

Watch faces are little funky but you could add ur own photos

"The product is good, i bought it for my father and it is really good and he likes it.",4
Good smart watch with SpO2 and body temperature 🌡️ measurements very useful information to take precautions for COVID-19. Vitals like heart rate and BP are really beneficial for hypertensive patients. This watch also serves as a fitness tracker. Overall value for money.,4

"I am writing this review after 22 days

First of all the battery life
It takes about 2 hrs to fully charge it
When u charge for 💯 percent of battery it easily long for min of 1 day on high usage
I used to attend online class for continuously for 7 hrs starting from 9 am morning to 4pm evening
In between i use whatsapp and Instagram often and also used to play PUBG for 1 hr in between break in evening after 4 i used to listen to music the @ 8 pm the battery will be nearly 15 percent..
So battery life good .

Next camera quality of it is good
Next fro playing pubg
It works flawlessly in HD graphics when went above i have very slight lag
Otherwise it's good

Display quality is very good
Also when continuously playing pubg i have abslight heating issue which is common in redmi phone
But nonthat extent

Conclusion : worth for money in this money segment .",4
Watch has some amazing features. Interface is really nice. App needs some work for which feedback has already been shared with the company.,4
nice product with nice sound quality at reasonable price,4
For this price it is an excellent phone. Works really great. Looks stylish. I bought it for my neighbour. He has given good feedback.,4
Very good.Very nice quality,4
"This sea blue smartphone looking is too good and fast working .
Battery life is too good as compare by 4000 MAH battery
. Front camera is awesome but rear camera little desopoint .
Redmi note 3 rear camera is good as compare to Redmi 8a dual",4
"The phone is alright. The screen quality is bad. Can't set up any image as wallpaper, as most just make the screen look distorted/pixelated. Sometimes I can't take a call by swiping up and alternatively receive it from the notification panel. Apart from the screen issues, the phone has been working fine so far. I had no camera requirements, so the poor camera isn't a problem for me. If someone just wants to keep a secondary phone or a phone for rough use, can buy it (with no high expectations in mind).",4
"Specification good enough
Bought for attending online classes and it is very smooth. Have tried streaming videos, MS office files and I have not seen any lags.
Not much of a gamer so haven't utilized 100% of HW.
Charging time is about 3 hours and lasts more than a day.
Camera quality average.
1 major concern for me is the display when the phone is operated outdoor. The brightness level is so low we can barely see anything under the sun light",4
"Good sound quality. Wires are a bit thin, so worried about durability. Satisfied at this price. Buy when it's on discount.",4
"Has a bug, only a limited connected device get internet access and remaining devices gets connected to router but says no internet, eveytime after a router reboot the internet works on the remaining devices,",4

"I am someone who is switching from Sennheiser Momentum series, and after using these for such a low price I don't miss them at all. These earphones are really nice, tho it's wire make a lot of noise but irritates a lot but it can easily be looked over seeming the price we are getting tjis for.",4
Very usefull,4
"Features mentioned in mi band 5 is working good. Screen quality is superb.quality of strap is also good.Acurracy of heart rate sensor ,step counter and stress monitor is good.i didn't expect this much accuracy.it does the job very mobile app(mi fit app) also compliments the performance of mi band 5. sleep monitor works perfectly well and it gives the complete information of sleep activity. Battery is also good. with one full charge it gives u 14 days of battery life .if you use the activities lesser then it will last up to 24days (depends on the usage). overall battery performance and accuracy is much good than expected. If someone need budget smartband then you can buy it. It's definitely value for money.",4
Good but if touches any hard thing get scratches,4
"nice product signal strength is ok ok enough ,amzonpackage was not good delivery in time.5ghz is very fast",4
Overall performance is good but camera quality is not up to the mark and can be enhanced little more. Sometimes WiFi calling makes it difficult to call and it shows out of coverage so it's advisable not to use WiFi calling. Overall performance is nice.,4
"I am using this Router from last 1 month and it is really good..
Installation is prity simple and straight forward.
Wifi signal is also very good.
I have kept it in my bed room and accessing from my drawing room which having 3 walls in between but the signal strength is full.
Internet Speed is also good.
You can go for it.
I have not yet availed Tech support so can't comment on that.",4

Like the clouds .touch is not perfect,4
Looks good.... easy to use......but could have been sturdier,4
3/5,4
A very good product with great sound quality and fits in just right but has an unclear mic. So for those who don't need to use the mic constantly and just need it for listening it's a very good product.,4

"Good product, i used with canon 200d ii

It has a good battery life. And quality,4
Good product liked it,4
"I had a huawai router before this, and I could not access the connections in my whole house. I thought taking a duo antena router would solve this problem, but what I thought did not happen. And even its connectivity is a bit problematic as my tab would never scan and find its network. Finally I called the service centre and the problem was solved. Amazon offers a good price for this product (just 2000) In the markets of Pune this product is being sold for 2650.",4
the router is nice but sometimes has connectivity problems this can be easily handled by pressing the rest button,4
"very good product,i am very pleased with it",4
A nice product,4
"Blood pressure measurement is wrong. Otherwise very useful.

With so many complaints/reviews about BP measurement, company is obliged to revert a correction.",4
Awesome and cool smart watch,4
Sleep tracking is awesome but issue in opening third party app notification that should also be in next update...,4
All things good but the drawback is only ports it is having only 2 ports.,4
"After 7days of use I'm writing this review for Redmi note 9 Aqua Green 4gb/64gb

1) Battery is very good for high & minimal use it will last long for 1 ½day after a full charge.
2) Sound quality is very good as well as loud enough.
3) Very stylish and decent look not so much heavy.
4) Fingerprint and unlock sensors are fast.
5) Display is very smooth and clear.
6) Front Camera is very good with nice picture quality.
7) Selfie camera picture quality is very bad, after selfie the picture seems like smoky dust.
8) Speed and processor are good for not a gaming phone..

My rate for this phone is 4/5
As I'm quite unsatisfied with the selfie camera and mainly the charging takes around 2hr from 10% to get fully charged

My opinion for this phone is good but not the best as I have thought before buying it.",4
"Nice, budget phone",4
"Good phone, camera not upto the mark",4
"Very useful for home or small office/ Business center. As per my point of view, print quality is a slight difference from other printers. But ok for me.",4
Easy to set up and range booster,4
"Good looking watch in budget. Has some good features, tracking is satisfactory.

Cons
Battery back up is max 4-5 days on full charge
Although screen has protection u need screen guard to protect from scratches",4
"Seeing price ,its a good choice for average user.",4
Good Print Quality,4
Good... nice speakers☺ I satisfied about this product ..but I didn't get warranty card ...,4

"Sound can be better..
Mate Finnish gives it a classy look.",4
Very nice watch...till no problem,4
"Good value for money.. Strap feels comfortable on wrist. Display bright and vibrant. Notifications works well and looks great on this small and elegant display. Steps counter seems to be some inaccuracy, can ignore if one isn't looking for precision.. And to be reasonable can't come the accuracy to more costlier ones.",4
"Excellent product
Images are sharp and clear
Best for beginners
Click nice photos even in low light
Only conc. Is that it doesn’t have autofocus in Video mode",4
Value for money can't say much but according to brand it can be a OKAY deal. Small size and dum processing speed. You can get better device at this price of any other brand. Samsung can do better,4
app is not working properly,4
Product is good but should come with height adjustable stand,4
"I purchased this phone without thinking twice because of the brand Samsung and as expected the phone is very good, battery back up is nice, j could say it is worth the amount spent.",4
"It is not suitable to any camera dvr. Cameras are lagging when we use the camera application which is available in your phone, when you are connected to any other Internet.",4
This watch is worth the penny spent on this. It has pretty descent features including Spo2 monitoring which will give you a fair idea of your oxygen levels. The app is good enough and supports most of the essential features that you look for in a smart watch. You really can't ask for more from a watch priced below 3k.,4
"The product is all over very nice ,trusted brand ,good signal and high range....",4
"Good features, though I never used App support, but its good as used by my friend. Using since past 4 months, no issues.

Very easy to install and it's really worth for that price point and for a small house as a repeater iam using. TNX to Amazon..,4
Better than expected!!,4
Works well with mobile app. Just got it today and it completes all the functions mentioned. Good value for money.,4
It's good for basic monitoring of your health but it doesn't have temp and heart calibrate facility where we can add doc. Input,4
"The Product is very easy to install. Signal is very good all the time. Full on deal.
🤘🤘
Thanks to seller I got it on time. Very good product service.",4
Everything is perfect. One cons I have to mention here is there is no bass control. But the sound is perfect.,4
"Good normal,sri mobiles service person installation and demo is best",4
Its really little complicated to install all the setup,4
Worth buying.,4

"Amazing headphones, perfect for high bass songs and casual gaming.",4
Good product with low price,4
Good product but camera quality poor,4
"This Goqii smart watch is very useful for me...i m very satisfied with this product, thank you amazon",4
A well refined product with best sound quality and bass is just awesome. Loved this but the problem lies with the bluetooth connectivity and its body.,4
NICE SMART WATCH,4
The range of the product is minimal. I get disconnected at 13mtrs from the router and this is where my previous MTNL provided router would also get disconnected. Not a major upgrade whatsoever. But ya does its job of keeping me wireless and was easy to setup. Would not recommend for long range and signal significantly drops beyond doors and walls.,4
"Nice product - body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and most important SPO2 monitor in one smart watch. Smart watch Looks amazing and very stylish. The GOQii app is nice and informative. Must buy for your self and family.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Good for gaming. Not so loud(appropriate for gaming only). Absolute bang for the buck. Best one you can get in this budget",4

"The amazfit bip u is a perfect product with all the required features..
Pros-
-Large screen size and resolution
-value for Money

Cons
-Battery life could have been more better",4
the product is of good build quality great for home use. If you have good open space at home then try these out. Since due to obstacles its range is limiting.,4
So far everything going good,4
Liked it. Good look and feel with bigger screen than other watches. Works smoothly. Sensor accuracy is good. Only thing missing is GPS.,4
"I love Sony Products, using MDR-XB400 from past 6+ years, got MDR-ZX110A recently haven't expected it to be so good, Sound Quality is more than average for this price of Rs.400. Built Quality is Best. I will keep updates as i use it more.",4

Good looking watch but disconnecting problem,4
"unit is nice . I have one question about the functioning of this unit , pl advise me suitably

Immediately on power switch on the power point on this unit RED mark is coming and after a short while it gets normal . Is it OK or otherwise",4
"Ink guzzler. But great value for money as initial cost is less.

Great product for SOHO setups.

If used extensively it will turn out to be an expensive option.",4
"Only irritating thing is it starts says ""battery low please charge"" at 30%. Sound quality is pretty decent. Really loud, base is good too. I don't think you can find anything better at this range it's pretty cheap.",4
"I am not a fan of music , so for the price I think it does justice. It works fine . I can make my calls and listen to music. I dint have high expectations and it fits my needs",4
"Delivery was as promised in safe packaging. Router setup was quite easy. Line to modem splitter provided with router did not work, so using my old one. There is a step during installation when a question related to ""network shell"" is asked 5 times continuously (said OK each time). Apart from this installation was smooth. The new router replaces my old Beetel ADSL modem + D-Link DIR-650 combo. And I get stronger network through my 1400+ sq ft apartment incl balconies.",4
"About Demo Cartridge:
COLOR: (STANDARD PRINT: 5 PAGES approx & DRAFT PRINT: 15 approx)
BLACK: (STANDARD PRINT: 8 PAGES approx& DRAFT PRINT: 20 approx)

About Printer:
1. Takes 2-3 minutes to initialize on first startup i.e. every-time you switch it on.
2. Print quality Good. (8/10)
3. White Plastic Body Part of Printer Attract dust very much.
4. Scanner Shutter is not heavy it means to scan clearly you have to put some weight on it.
Solution: Put main document to scan on ""Scanner Glass Surface"" then put some more A4 Unused White Papers on the main document then close the scanner shutter and put some heavy book on it.
5. Scan Quality is Good and Preview Quality is Poor so don't get stunned to see blur preview just complete the scan and see the quality of the output, its really good. SCAN QUALITY: (8/10).
6. Printing Time: STANDARD QUALITY PRINT: 10-17 SECONDS & DRAFT QUALITY PRINT: 5-12 SECONDS.

**EVERYTHING IS WORKING GOOD I WISH THE SCANNER SHUTTER WAS HEAVY ENOUGH LIKE OTHER PRINTERS JUST BECAUSE OF THAT SCANNING PROCESS GONE INTO MULTIPLE STEPS.**",4
Woofer wire length is very short.,4
🤩,4
"I actually purchased it as a replacement for my JBL BT500 which stopped working after a drop from 5 feet height. If i compare with the JBL bt500 it not close to it. but yeah for this price its really decent.

Bass is not that high but good.
Sound quality good
Battery life is decent.
Noise cancellation average with this price you can't expect this",4
Perfection at its best,4
"Nice product, Matched the expectations. Good battery life, other features are up to the mark.",4
Good router! works perfectly fine. As with any router you've to place it strategically for max. coverage. Dual antenna helps. If your place does not have many obstacles like wall and magnetic field then go for a single antenna. If you want to cover larger area this should be your choice.,4
Nice sounds feels comfortable no extra base no noise cancellation the sound like theatre effect,4
"Pros:
1. Display is really good.
2. It's compact and Lightweight
3. It's better for Programming and development work in this price range (37 K)

5. Booting start within 4-6 sec.
6. Restart within 12-18 sec.
7. Genuine Windows with Microsoft Office
8. Battery back-up is descent
9. Perfect for student

Cons:
1. Fan position is very bad. Display get warm by hot air flow (Who's the architect???)
2. Camera quality is not so good
3. Voice recording is also little bit noisy
4. Internal storage is only upgradable by replacing. no extra slot
5. Not for gaming",4
The product is good. Screen quality and battery life is good. The accuracy of the distance is a bit compromised though. Not that bad but just a tiny bit.,4
Printing speed is very slow,4
Product is good and print quality is also good its value for money,4

Ok to used in dailly usase no hard gaming uses,4
The router is pretty bulky. Signal strength across walls and doors is a little concern. Signal drops at times especially on 5GHz band. Installation of router is dead simple. Managing through tether app is super simple. Overall this budget router does its job decently.,4
Fire boltt smart watch a grt product at an economical price. If u are health conscious then I will tell u that bp accuracy is not gud just shows some random numbers but heart rate and oxygen saturation are to the point..Touch is gud and app connectivity is also gud..,4

The watch is nice. Heartrate and the spot measures makes it more worth.,4
"There are cheap 200 rupee earphones, there are the premium AirPod-like branded spin-offs that set you back by a few thousands and then there are these pTrons. Under a thousand, solid functionality, OK sound, decent build quality, fast pairing - you get a bit more than you paid for. Don't expect too much, and you won't be disappointed.",4

My battery is still 38% after 10 days
Pros-
1- nice design
2- good battery life
3- sleep tracking ( I love it 😍😍😍)
4- value for money
5- accuracy(not much sure🙄🙄🙄)
6- display is cool
7- comfortable and easy to wear
8- waterproof

Cons-
1- 3rd class packaging (no proper care ever its value is 2.5k)
2- interfare with my Bluetooth gamepad and i lag alote while playing games. Hate this as i can't disconnect this band. If i disconnect, it automatically pairs and if i unpair band all of my data get erase.
Hate this thing so much. Mi must allow us to disconnect band from phone even my bluetooth is on.
I hate this hate this hate this sssooo much
3- no response to my complaint made in mi fit app. They don't care about our complaint.😤😤😤
4- paying rs 500 more than Chinese users even for less features than chinese version☹️☹️
5- not made in india",4
"the step counter is not accurate, heart rate sensing is late, raise to on display is delayed or somtimea doesn't work at all.
With my experience from honor band and mi band i can say that step counter is more accurate in honor band and also the raise to on the display is better in honor band.

But mi band is more customisable and even the accessories are cheaper than that for honor band

Overall i can say it is the best choice if you are looking for a more customisable band with similar features as that of the other bands in the market",4
Gud one. Though wondering about how long it will work. The sound quality and bass are gud too.,4
"Best in it's range.

As battery mentioned 5000mah but not upto mark compare to Samsung phones 500mah Battery charging takes upto 3hrs full charge from 0-100%.
overall performance good 24gb user available.
6"" inch display best in this price range.

OTHERWISE IT IS A BEST EARPHONE WITH GOOD BASS AND SOUND QUALITY",4
"Orderd on 23 dec 20.
Delivered 25 decide 20.
Reviewed on 4 Jan 20.
It is a good budget 2k (1440p) monitor. Received both dp and hdmi cable. Make sure while connecting your dp port don't have any part of cabinate coming out as obstacle for connection. Because the dp cable has larger connector part, otherwise you will see no display. Refresh rate is 75hz on 1440p resolution through dp cable, did not try on hdmi cable. Thankfully no dead pixel, no ips glow even in dark room. Also stand is not thay wobbly. Enjoying old games at 2k with dual core (pentium g4500) and r7 260x 1gb. Even crysis 2 is running good and 2k with highest setting. It has Freesync2 version and working great. No real hdr, it is just increasing brightness and adjusting the other parameter.
Try contrast 60-70, brightness 50-57 to enjoy good colour and to protect eyes.
Final verdict it is good to enjoy 2k gaming, watching movies for regular and casual user/ gamer.",4
"Like:- Decent camera quality, great multi tasking ability without being delay or any lag, best battery performance of almost 1 & half days with moderate to heavy users.

Dislike:- UI is not clean & full of bloat wares. I came from Stock UI which is clean & have a smooth functioning comparatively.",4
Best monitor under this price. No inbuilt speaker. Picture quality is good.,4
I am happy as i gifted my most preferred mobile i acquired at in good condition and it's work still without any hasitation and hassle free,4
Dual mic provide the better sound to the person other side making it good for calls,4
Nice camera. Picture quality ok not the best but acceptable. Have been using it since last 2 months. Only con is it does not have software to control and see recording on pc or laptop Although it does support rtsp protocol so we can see live feed but no recording or cannot manage camera using computer to manage camera and to see recordings one need to use mobile or tablet running android or ios. Otherwise it's good and can is worth the money.,4
"This is awesome.. The sound quality is very good. Its clear and and loud as well. It can shake your room and the neighbors will go crazy.
The bluetooth connectivity is very fast and connects within seconds. But the volume adjustment, when on bluetooth is little bit strange with some devices(Mobile phones). It will be very loud and when you reduce the volume it will become very low but with some adjustments it will be fine.
Work pretty well with aux cable.
The Blue LED looks very nice with all the lights out and room is dark.
Remot control is samll and cute, but working is nice.
Only con is that there are no knob or button, to control bass and eco, on the speakers. You will have to adjust it in your devices. Go to equalizer setting and fix it. And you will have perfect sound. Actually i dont like too much bass so i felt the issue. For many it wont even matter.
Over all the producy is great. Value for money. I simply loved it.",4
"Overall Product is good.
Please add new features like realtime blood pressure monitoring etc.",4
"Awesome product, the sound quality is awesome. The bass and treble is quite impressive. With price range like this, go for this product blindly. The one thing which amazon missed this time was the packaging.",4

Bass thoda or hota to .. (5star )...",4
"This product is apt for listening to good quality music, as it provides good bass and clear notes.

Only shortcoming of this product is while taking the call other person can not get your voice clearly.. That means weak reception by microphone

Otherwise its a good product.. the knob can be bit of issues if you wear under a helmet.",4
Nice printer scanning and printing quality is very good,4
Excellent product satisfiedbut mic is not too good but enough and not satisfied with bass of this headphone,4
Only point is that there is no notification light setting on phone otherwise awesome,4

"Everything is perfect, just mic has some stability and voice issues when on bluetooth connection",4
It's just been less than a month since I bought it and the material and the sound quality is good. Right now I can't comment or rate this product for its durability since it's too early to make a call. But will do it after some months,4

Blutooth litl bit poor,4
BEST BUDGET MONITOR BUT BRIGHTNESS IS NOT THAT GOOD REST IT IS A COMPLETE PACKAGE NO COMPLAINTS FOR THIS PRICE RANGE.,4
"I am using this product for step tracking mostly.And monitoring my BPM during exercises. Must say that the tracking is vey much accurate. Display wise the display is vivid and looks very nice with the Amoled screen. The product build itself looks premium. Light weight. Coming to the spo2 measurements, it does a good job. But do cross-check with an oximeter for better accuracy. Tracks the sleep data as well. Battery wise it lasts 5-6 days. Maximum battery consumption happens during sleep when it constantly monitors the BPM and sleep quality is what I observed.",4
Disappointed to see scratches on display after unboxing. Highly Disappointed. Please do not repeat this.,4
On time. As expected,4
The product is quite good but didn't last long. It has not been even five months that it has been damaged. I handle it with good care and still it is now only audible from one side. I didn't expect a product from a renowned company will turn out to be like this.,4
Really awesome colour and design in the price,4
Nice router with good range in the segment with best price. Only problem is unavailability of service centers and their contact information. But what I want to mention is I have never experienced any issues with this router.,4

"Sleep tracking poor
Mobile app more watch face required
Touch screen too good",4
The design and dialpad is as expected and especially it can check your Bloodpressure and SPO2 which is rare in other smart watches,4
It is a good mobile for normal use but if we do some heavy work so it starts to lag and by the company its given 3 gb ram but the performance is not up to the mark,4
Good budget headphone,4
The watch is decent and it is value for me. No complaints till date.,4
The noisefit app can't able to connect with the device and it gives lots of anr issues. Otherwise the product is good.,4

"I bought 2 different model(Hp/benq)27"" monitors and both had some serious light bleeding issues so I returned it.and seller refunded immediately. it that was great. after I bought this one. this one surprised me. No light bleeding. Picture quality is great. Minimum light reflection. Auto brightness works perfectly. 1080p is good.. 2k would be perfect if they launch it in future with reasonable price.",4
"It is a very good product. Thanks to Amazon for quick delivery. Device is has good range and working soothly, due to double atennae, there is full single in all corner of my flat of more than 1300 sq ft. I live on 5th floor, however, i have observe that i can connect to this router from ground floor with slightly weak single.",4
Excellent at this price segment,4
"Over all the mobile is pretty good at that cost but the mobile takes nearly 5 hrs for full charge & 30 minutes nearly for 10% of charge, it's little weight except these the mobile performance is nice.......",4
So far ... experience is good. Let's see after using some .. how the mobile processor behaves,4
Good product but cannot use it for more than 1 hrs as it does not feel comfort,4
Overall satisfying experience,4
"I returned it bcoz i use headphones 4-5 hours,
This headphone does not fit my head and my ears start pain after 1 hour,

This is best,,...
But only prblm is pain in ears after an hour...",4
Good but price is high by mi.,4
Battery life is awesome,4
Didnot received aux cable with this,4
Small home or business application it's good.,4
Every facilities are usable and having good look watch,4
"The product is very good for the price paid. However, the touch screen leaves something to be desired.",4
"See guys there is always a confusion while going to buy a new set of earphones ..I have used mi basic,mi,boat bassheads 225,etc .So at the price range <700 this is worth buying compared to mi basic and mi and boat ..boat can also be a good choice as it has a L shape connector ..but Jbl has some extra loudness and bass..but it is your luck upto how many days you won't get any problem in the earbuds ..as i have usually seen the main problem with budget earphones is that one of the earbuds stop working within some weeks of buying ..So mi basic is worst in this case..Go for this if you are getting confusion over mi,boat,senheiser etc..",4
Good product.Good quality bass super im full satisfied...,4

"Nice product and good in audio quality.
But not comfortable on ears for a longer time.",4
Sound output is very good but mic quality is not good at all.,4
Best print quality,4
"Cons

As we all know that Samsung isn’t very good in implementing optical fingerprint sensor & that’s why unlocking with fingerprint takes more than one attempt.

It takes 2.30 hours to full charge because of it’s 15Watt charging support.

Video stabilisation needs improvement

Pros

Battery life is very impressive.

5G connectivity with more than 3 bands.

Crisp Display as it’s Amoled (HD+ only).

Cameras performance are good enough in daylight.",4
Auto focus is not good for videography also the auto focus of face detection is slow. Overall the camera is superb,4
Liked,4
Excelellent,4
It's a great camera for biggnier. Only drawback no option for connecting external mic.,4
Like a Normal phone,4
"Love the sound quality and make......noise cancelling is also pretty good. Worth the money

when Bluetooth is turned off in headphones without disconnecting from the laptop and turned back on only the voice is gets connected, to get the music I have to reconnect it that is the only issue I have.

The above said issue only happens with laptops that too just initial connecting process.....................there are no connectivity issues during playtime.",4
Nice product but its just a stereo and not a 5.1 like effect ... Everything is working fine and bass is good..,4
"Best band in the price range, also easy to use, specially liked the belt. Battery is also lasting as committed by the company.",4
"Amazing Headphone from Sony. At this price, it is the best Headphone to buy. Only deducted a star because of its packing and delivery service. It was a bit late than I expected it.

Nice Product. It is not very loud but the quality of sound is quite good.,4
Good product for home usage,4
No headphones only charger and mobile there,4
Gud products,4
"Brought the product on a 50%sale, making it a great deal. The product claims to have strong and sturdy wires but however doesn't seem to. Though the quality of the wires is much better it looks like they would break off by a not so strong pull. The product is literally the best in all other segments be it noise cancellation, bass or sound quality.",4
Everything is Good. Don't change the Design as there is a separate catagory for watches. Band should be like Band only. Please add inbuilt GPS and SpO2 sensor in coming versions of the Band to enhace the accuracy.,4
"It's been a day since I used this router. Previously I had tp link wr840n which was a basic model and this is acctually a pretty good upgrade compared to that... The range is quite good and the 5Ghz channel is working faster and covers decent distance...

Overall this is a best product to buy if u need to upgrade from basic router and u need unitrupted usage....

Go for it...",4
"Good product but the size of ear matters.if you have a big ear you should think about it..
Better for ear phonea then",4

The quality of the headphone is Excellent at this price bracket,the sound is crystal clear with adequate Bass Effect.

The only complain is getting vga cable in box.
Update 2 speakers are very low quality.",4
The headphone is good sound quality is also good the material is good and may be duarable,4
"It has a good sound compared to its price. The only low about this product is that, there is a certain part of the speaker that rattles and in audible in the ears. I hope its not the case with all the headphones. Probably a small defect in mine. Nevertheless, it doesn't bother me much. Its worth the price of the product.",4
"Nikons latest one of the D series.

"Pretty Good stuff from p tron.
The sound quality has been compromised at the low cost. Bass quality is poor and sound quality is not good as promised in the description. Useful for calls... Not recommened for playing songs or watching movies. Battery life is amazing, as promised a prolonged battery life of around 6 to 7 hours on continuous use. Around 3 hrs for full charge. Good and fast connectivity. Overall worth the money.
Note: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PLAYING SONGS. (If music is the sole puropse of purchase, please dont go for it. U will be disappointed. )
I personally use it for calling purposes and it served useful to me! :)",4

The playback in mobile app is bit confusing.",4
"Nice product, makes the music more better. Everyone should try it once.",4
Very good printer at such cost by hp but the ink is somewhat costly as per printing cost.also if printer is not used for some days then paper jams occur.,4
Camera quality and battery life are good. I have not used fingerprint reader as the user manual was missing in the box. If you can guide me about finger reader i can use it.,4
Excellent features at this cost... Except that it lacks a fingerprint sensor.,4
Sound quality is good and value for money hi bass only one problem he is preses ear hardly,4
Everything is very good sound build qulity in this price range...Wire is tick no tension abut pullimg out metal jack holds very good but only problem is its not very good sweat resistance form gets bubbly due to wear in gym,4

The right side earphone is losted. You mentioned that these as 1 year warranty . how can i calm the warranty.bad service for warranty.,4
All good except the step accuracy,4
only catridge issue,4
It shows severely mis-accurate steps. It does not have gyroscope that allows for accurate motion sensing that can determine whether you are walking or not. I was really disappointed with this since it was my main focus. Other than that i don't have any problem with the watch.,4
"Good camera but not a perfect camera.
Slightly over priced and image stabilization is not good. If you want to see full review with video samples,you can see on
Dr Kalpana singh YouTube channel.",4

"Giving this review after 1 year of Purchase and Usage..
Since I am a low budget user i came across this product searching for good quality 5.1 speakers . I searched several speakers and roamed shopping malls to check thier quality(i literally did this :P).. I personally liked this product and compared the prices here on amazon..
Believe me you wont get this sound quality on any low budget home theatres..

Pros:

1- Awesome Sound Quality
2- Total 6 speakers which makes us feel really surrounding
3- Powerful sub woofer
4- Attractive Design with powerful LEDs
5- Bluetooth 3.0 support with dedicated controls (Which you won't get in this Price range , it's my guarantee;)
6- FM receiver with an antenna
7- Separate remote to control each speaker , equalizer and subwoofer controls
8- Long wires to set it up on corners
9- Sturdy and strong cabinets
10- Free AUX wire :D (doesnt come with any other product)
9- Super Attractive price

Cons :

1- BlueTooth range is about 15 metres, so limited to single , or maximum two rooms

Horrible packaging😂. The fittings is not perfect but that does not cause compromising of the sound quality. Also u get microphone for the same price as MDRZX110A. Anyways a satisfactory product and something u can look forward to,4
"Received Today. Seems to be good product overall. I found the older model weighs about 700 gram more and build quality is better. Samsung says this is a T35F IPS 75Hz Panel. I don't know if performance wise this is better than the LS24R350FH Model. But feature wise I find no difference. The stand is made of plastic with no aluminium shield, which is available with the older model.

If you buy the newer T35F model please verify if it is really better than the older one.

Another thing the Model I have received is Made in Vietnam.",4
Driver not available to install printer,4
European Great earphones.Good quality,4
Hazzle free charging is one of the best fearures... PAI monitoring made me realize how less my activity was... Using it for 2 days and i am happy with it,4
"Watch is nice, the interface is good but the battery is decent. I used it from the day it arrived with full charged and after 15hours it is 60% battery. Calculation of steps is fine and the watch faces are amazing brightness is good to see in sunlight. It calculates exact hours of sleep and the time you sleep and you wake up. Remember you didn't reliable on heart rate and stress monitor. This is not a medical device. The overall watch is value for money.",4
"I'm using GOQii smart watch for last 15 days and can it is one of the good device in use. HR, SPo2, steps count are accurate and also loved the Excercise feature. Overall happy with the product.
GOQii mobile app still needs improvement, there is sort of latency and also not user friendly. Hope the team will and work on this.",4

If possible kindly help with troubleshooting steps otherwise I'll go for return/refund,4
Driver cd not included,4
Easy print and to use.,4
If you are going to buy this headphone for your regular 2-3hours gaming then its not a great choice..this headphone is for listing music watching movies..if you keep the headphone at neck and work around then it hurts the nech it is the only issue with its build quality and its really light weight..sound quality is great and bass is Op..go for it if you are a casual user..,4
"Everything is so good😍 about the earphones in quality, noise cancellation, and bass. Simplicity at its best, jus go for it 👍",4
Covering well inside all my rooms. Not good for above my floor.,4
Awesome Phone in this price range 😍,4
"Connected to Airtel's Binatone 5v modem.
1. It's as easy as a piece of cake to get it installed.
2. Since a month, its working like a charm.
3. No disconnectivty or outage issues.

As much as I believed reading other reviews, before buying it, so as is I'm I telling to the interested ones to buy it blindfold.
An absolute saver for me during intermittent power outages. Check your modem ratings before buying though.",4
"Best in budget, battery life is good, screen is good",4
The phone is very good .Nice battery backup with 18watt fast charge support .Nice and smooth gaming performance .Camara was good.But not suitable for high end games and while playing free fire kept at ultra high fps phones start heating and battery draining fast .,4

Great Phone for this Price.,4
Value for money battery backup is very good.,4
Good sound quality in this budget..,4
"The device is light and ergonomically designed for ease of placement and use. Wi-fi coverage is similar like anyother device (10-15m), notable is the strength of network on 5Ghz band is praiseworthy. The Qualcomm chipset is well in place for this performance.
The model is an year old, but at this price point it's a must buy, can smoothly handle bandwith speed upto 867 mpbs which is sufficient for home and office use considering the present range offered by different ISPs. Update the latest framework version to get the best out of it.
The utility of this device is worthy for a buy.",4
Takes a little time to connect,4
"only works for 100mbps.
dont buy is your internet connection is above 100 mbps.

Good Quality..,4
"This laptop is only for light usage and don't install heavy softwares. Handle this laptop with care because it is very fragile and light weight.

Screen clarity is poor but I don't want because of price for which I purchased after replacing my 10 year old laptop.

Battery seems to be okay but check it performs after 3~4 months.

No heating issue reported for basic usage.

Overall it is value for money for me.",4
"Such a Wonderful Sound Quality,Noise Cancellation & Bass Quality...",4
"I have used it for about a month now and it is working fine. The setup/configuration instructions are tailored for a PC running Windows. If you have Mac, it can be a bit confusing: however, a call to Airtel technical desk helped get id done within minutes.",4

"A nice decent product, useful and easy to use.
It did take some help to set up WiFi but once done it's super easy to operate the printer.
Print quality is good, haven't yet tried on photo paper but color documents have good prints. One can scan and copy too from the mobile app and directly save the scanned documents on mobile, which I feel is an added advantage. Print speed isn't that slow either, I would certainly recommend this product. Only thing I am not sure is whether the printer will deliver 7000 colour pages with the ink that is given with it .....time will tell. But in all a good purchase....even for parents who need prints for school projects.....",4
"The high tones and mid tones, vicals are good. Bass comes when it's there though it can be bettered. Well can't complaint considering its price. Overall for a price of 599/- one can totally go for this.",4

2. some of area in my house not get wifi signal so i planned to relocate modem. if i relocate it will be disconnected from UPS. so i planned to purchase it

Best smartphone in low price rate.,5
"Ultimate... You wish for little more range but again, even at far distance it gets connected at 48 mbps. Enough for N300 router.. USB sharing works easily with SAMBA function.. Additional feature which i realized after using it is good broadband speed. Before this i used utstar BSNL provided type -1 modem and Belkin G Wireless router. After switching to this, i received good range and connectivity (as expected) but i started receiving good broadband speed too.. Really happy with this device..

Advice for new buyers: Do not think about updating firmware version just because its mentioned as 1.10 on dlink site and you have received 1.02. It is already updated version than one mentioned on Dlink website. Also, for good wifi range, placement of router is important. Place it as much as you could near the roof.

Thank you!",5
The quality of products is really very good and durability is also very good. the most important things is sounds quality is really impressive and deep base gives to feel with real D.j like music..i love the product,5

"It is good dual band router for home at
this price. I am using it for past few months and have not seen any issues with it yet.",5
"I am writing this review after using the product for 6 hours. When I had ordered this, I did not have much idea about routers and I bought it because it fit my budget. The broadband guy said that I should have purchased a different one with a better configuration - gigabytes router or something. Then I got confused and asked him to try using this router first and if this doesn’t work we’d get a different one. When he installed this, the router worked just fine. I have taken a 60 mbps plan and I have checked my internet speed multiple times which is always coming to somewhere in between 45~52 mbps. Quite satisfied with this speed to be honest. Also I have installed the router in the second floor and when I use any device in the ground floor I get a speed of around 35~40 or even more. If this continues then this router is definitely worth keeping. Affordable price and good service.",5
I love the product. It is as just expected. I will recommend this to all my friends.,5
Nice product. But it has some configuration issues in windows 8,5
Super and outstanding performance,5
A very good product 👌,5

This awesome by Philips. I never thought this kind of quality @this price. Great work for small flat room. But make sure this is not for >300sqft room size.,5
I am using it for 2 months and it is really superb giving very good speed.,5
Nice mobile use,5

"Probably the best 300mbps router you can find in this price bracket.
Range: don't expect double the coverage compared to 150mbps single antenna routers but definitely better, If you're having trouble with signal quality with your old 150mbps router at one room at the other corner of your house this could be a cheap solution.

Repeater function : It supports repeater function out of the box through WDS bridging, although TP Links states WDS bridging between routers of different make may not be possible i got it done with my Asus DSL N10E. Another method to use it as a repeater is to flash DD-WRT firmware which is available nd it also unlocks a vareity of other features but remember it voids warranty.
(note: WDS bridging limits bandwidth of router according to base router's so if its bridged with 150mbps router you get only that)

UI : simple UI with standard options and features that you could find in any router in the range, and TP link provides an android app - TP Link tether - which enables basic control of router from android device like managing connected clients.

The one thing i could complain is its white color, which looks actually good now but since routers are bound to be spending most of its life in a corner or on walls and eating dust the white would soon turn into something else.",5

First of all it's very very light.

Screen : 4.5/5
Vibration :4.5/5
Build quality : 3.9/5
Heart rate accuracy : 4.5/5 (measured with oxymeter)
SpO2 accuracy : 3.7/5 (difference of 2 to 3 percent with oxymeter)

Steps and activities I haven't measured yet. I will update regarding that later.

I was suspicious regarding screen quality and build quality but It was impressive. Best in price point and it is lot better than Noise colorfit pro 2 if anyone has doubts.

You should go for it.

ALSO ON AMAZFIT WEBSITE YOU CAN SEE IN DESCRIPTION THERE WILL BE AMAZFIT BIP U PRO WITH MIC. I HAVE ATTACHED IMAGE ALSO.

Easy access to all features like screenshot screen order etc. Even you need not have to download screen recorder too. It's already present in this version. For me it's really a great option and hope my review will help you too.,5

"Initial Comments - Needed a printer that could support both windows and Mac. This one fits the bill.
Pretty smooth installation for Windows - picked up my home wifi router without any issue, and the printer
's own wi fi works fine as well
Installation on mac was a bit longer - for both Mac OS 10 and Mac OS 11 - the drivers are not pre installed. You need to go to the L3150 series page on epson website and download the driver. Once installed - it picks up the printer smoothly. In less than 30 minutes - i was able to print from 2 windows laptops, 2 Macs and 3 Android mobile phones.
Epson iPrint app is fairly smooth on the mobile phone. You could choose the page layouts, number of pages, etc with simple swipes.
Filling in the ink is easy enough, the ink bottles are spillproof.
All in all - fairly utility printer, smooth installation, and importantly worked smooth across devices.
Would get to know the longevity of ink and per page cost over the usage, and would update the review later.",5

"Amazing printer at reasonable price

Although i don't think it can print as claimed, I'll try to update review after a month or two

😉 You can print with otg also just download nakoprint or printersharer app from play store

Installation in just 10 min

Scanner is 700dpi (at least that's what max showing in custom scan option)
Stitching of scanned files also available (though its manual)

Photo print will consume more ink but it will give avg studio like prints ; )

It uses ink pumps so no risk of ink clogging, dont try to get cheaper printer to install CISS, it's bad idea CISS will cost 1000 with no pump, no service from company, cartridge will leak after some prints... Its just mess...

This is best at 8.3k (2 additional black ink bottles)",5

"I'm actually downgrading myself from Gear S2 to this one. Except for the size and style, everything else works great (except HR). Sleep and sedentary tracking actually works great. I love it. And the wrist band is an added convenience when compared to S2. You can wear this 24/7. Only major con for me is that It does tend to show heart rate even when it's not worn. Slightly lesser inconvenience could be the app's interface. When compared with Samsung its not so user friendly...",5

"First Things First:

You need to activate the Eye Care feature in the monitor. It is not ""ON"" by default. I realised it after 3-4 months of usage! :/

Replacement under warranty:

My initial monitor developed a vertical line after 3 months of usage. No particular reasons for the line. Raised a complain with the BenQ customer care in their prescribed format. They immediately accepted the fault and agreed to replace the monitor under warranty.

Got the replacement of the monitor in 4-5 working days. No hassles, no paperwork. Appreciate the quick and professional response.

Coming to the monitor:
My usage is extensively for work purpose and seldom for watching movies.

This monitor meets both my requirement. The Anti-glare feature is particularly impressive. I also work late at night, with the lights switched off. The monitor auto adjusts the display brightness according to the light in the room. However, this feature has to be activated from the menu in the monitor.

Overall - Go for it if you are looking to buy for work purpose and little bit of videos/multimedia.",5

"Such an amazing headphone at a very good price point, when u start listening, u Just go with songs there is so stress in your head, like other bass headphones.
It's a pleasure, listening any songs, its having good amount of bass and most important the separation between bass and the lyrics, because in bass headphones, the bass kills the lyrics..

On the second day of purchase, I was on a webex meeting with my remote team and the power went off. Due to this, the meeting went smoothly. I highly recommend this product if you don't have UPS or inverter in your home. If you play online games, this can be very handy too.

UPDATE:
October 1st 2018 - Still working as a charm. No problems so far. Probably the best thing I have purchased in Amazon till now.",5

"Copy pasting this as I am also having the same problem! please do not purchase this printer, initially it works smoothly. I purchased it in 2019.i also printout only 10-15 copies. Now its not working as shows continuously light blink and did not take print from computer. I have checked it various OS, other laptops,desktop also. But it wont print, only continuously blinking light. I asked to my friend who purchase same printer before 1 year. He is also facing the same problem. Even he exchanged new printer from thana office becaz his printer is in warranty. The new printer also shows same problem after 3-4 months. And this problem is not repaired, we also given for repaired but it doesnt solve.",5
"It's been almost a decade since I bought a monitor and am extremely happy I bought this one.

The bezels are minimal and the matte is really effective.

The monitor pops a little bit front from the stand and requires a little space at the back because the HDMI jack's pop out.",5
"Nice product.
At my place ppower cut is not for longer time. But it is more frequent. I am been using it for last 5 months, working absolutely fine with no power lag.",5

Great product. Senders take care to ensure that it is compatible with your router. I can peacefully join conference calls thanks to this. The power on/ off button somehow doesn't seem to work for me. But it's probably a quirk in the piece I got.,5
At this price it is a nice product,5

Printer is very good. Easy to install especially with ink tank system very easy to refill the ink.,5
"Firstly, I have been using this earphones for about two months, and I haven't seen one single problem. The length is a little too long, but it's okay. Noise cancellation is just mind blowing. Even if you just put them on and not play anything also, you can't hear people talking around you. But if it's at full volume, even if battles are going on around you, you can't hear them(a little exaggeration, haha) If you are an extreme basshead, please go for boAt. The bass in this earphones is basically non existent, but hey, you don't buy JBL for the bass, but for the pure sound(which is wonderful, by the way) Even if you are a person who likes the Apple model of earphones, and not the shove in the ear type(like me), you won't find any problem with the comfort, thanks to the angled design. Finally, definitely buy this product, but wait until the price becomes 549 Indian rupees(about 7.45 US Dollars, 6.09 Euros) , because Amazon sometimes makes it 700 Indian Rupees(9.5 US Dollars, 7.78 Euros). Whatever type of person you are, you will find these earphones an absolute delight. I loved them, and I have given them a 5 star rating on everything except the bass. I recommend the white version(ONLY CAUSE IT LOOKS BETTER). Hope this review helps a lot of people. If it helped anyone, please say so. I will feel happy.",5
"Very easy to instal and excellent connectivity.
Very happy with the product.",5
Fantastic for any place with power fluctuations.,5
Loudly watch,5
"The control panel needs more visibility. Every time a button is pressed for a function, a page gets printed related to the function, which is redundant, waste. The paper feed tray could have been placed forward, below the printout tray. Otherwise very compact design and good quality prints and scan. After 6 months usage. can say very finnicky printer, paper gets stuck too often. Even if catridges are not empty, printing stops.need to replace catridges.",5
"Router is performing really well, no issues whatsoever in a month usage. Speed and signal quality is very good. Can use it in my garden and at rooftop. Loving it...",5
Best WiFi router so much easy to setup and customise definitely recommended,5

These are actually nice if you're confused which one to buy for office purpose you can definitely go for it. Bass is 4/5 coz I've seen more better but as I said these are good for office and regular use. Voice is clear and sweet to ears. Would recommend if you're looking for good earphones in less expense.,5

Awesome voice. Easy to connect. Gets connected with every device easily. Comfortably fits on ears. Connects with every device that connects with bluetooth.,5
"It’s quite better than the mi band 3, but the thing is it’s battery life is not good when automatic heart rate detection is turned on. I had turned automatic heart rate on and it lost 40% charging in 3 days. So, I had to turn it off. Byt, when it is turned off, the battery life is way better. Sometimes it reaches 30 days without recharge. It is worth the money. I love the colour display of the band and it’s features. It has various new features then those which the mi band 3 has, and also has AMOLED display but still the price difference is very low. You should go for it!",5
Ok not good,5
Everything abot this watch is great but spo2 have little bit accuracy problem and everything is just great i will only say 'just buy it' damn it!,5

"Yes after 2 days I am doing this review specially, for all and I just want to say about these speakers just one word, awesome. Don't think guys it's Philips, just place the speakers correctly at the right place at right distance and you will listen the fabulous surrounding sound in your room at only volume 1 and bass 1(in the night at the silence) pure bass and pure sound. I am just listing arijit singh songs through bluetooth and at the same time I am typing also. I am not bluffing I am posting a pic also while listing just see yourself I am listing music on just volume-1. Right now the time is 1:10 am. I am telling the time because I am telling about the volume. The 2nd speaker is on the right side can't cime in the pic. Any way so, just don't think it too much just buy it. Philips to have a service center in Kanpur. So just go for it. A big thumsup for this product👍",5

"Its 4k with HDR.
well until n unless u have a bluray player .u willnot be able to see the HDR cuz windows hdr support is crappy ..just doesnt work.

The SDR to HDR upscaling is great ..i mean even a sdr picture looks damn great in SDR to HDR upsclaing mode.

for gaming. the 60fps .u need to have a pc which can pump out 70+ fps ..othrwise ..the AMD freesync wont do its job. It will be crappy . two frames colliding with each other.

for content creation. coding .its a really great monitor with the added rotation feature with which u can rotate it and keep the monitor vertical",5
good product battry camera all very good,5
Nice and working as expected,5
"We been using this for 2 weeks almost. Connectivity is a very big problem. The wifi is never smooth. Every time it needs to be kind of reset. Very disappointed as this looks to be not so well tested product. I think I made mistake to choose this.
Update: revising rating from 3 star to 5 star. The real issue in connectivity was faulty router which caused printer to not work with Wifi. When I changed my old router with new device printer started working as expected. So as of now I don't see any issue and happy with the product so far. The ink seems consumed more but will revise the review in case ink is the issue. Will update further in the interest of potential buyers.",5
"The Best of segment. lightweight ...long range...great design..

If You are looking for a budget big screen monitor so you can choose it without any doubt.
I have purchased many monitors import segments higher prices and lower prices. And as my experience I think it's best budget monitor.

Happy With the Purchase. Thanks To Flipkart.",5
"I used to have an old ADSL2 Modem and Netgear wi-fi router. There was increasing amount of signal to noise ratio due to 2 boxes as wi-fi technology has changed. so I decided to buy this device and use it. The internet access has become much smoother and also 1 box is much cleaner with fewer wires and single power supply. The range of this device is at least 50 metres in all directions which is nearly double of my previous single antenna router.

Installation was easy . Customer need to know their PPOE Login and password from ISP to configure it successfully. After that it is smooth and fast.

This device is easily recommended for multi floor houses , villas and 4 BHK apartments . Just install and forget about it after that :)",5

"Product came very good. Sound quality is up to the point. I actually ordered two one in black & one in blue for my younger brother and we both tend to love it. Bluetooth connection very fast i would after when you would connect for the first time. However, their is a draw back is the headphones are very heavy and you can't wear it for very long time. Even the cusion of the ear - pads could have been more comfortable. I wouldn't recommend this for long hours of gaming but to watch videos on YouTube or listen music.😊",5

1. Sound quality GOOD (10/10)
2. You don't need any equaliser, just plug it in and play. Turn off all your equalisers for the pure sound. (Your songs quality also matter)
3. Price GOOD (10/10)
4. Looks & style - 7/10, because thy feel very delicate, if you pull it strongly, the earbuds may come off because thy have little no space other than the buds themselves. So handle with care. The one year warranty covers, internal damage, only, without water damage*.

It has multiple exercise options which makes it a unique in itself. Battery life is good, it lasts for good 4 days and the charger is convenient to carry.

"Amazing equipment for a beginner. Very easy to figure out the settings, even without the guide.",5
"Am writing this review after one week of usage. Got this on prime day sale for 13500.

Pros:
1) Best Home theatre System below 15K.
2) Sound quality is too good in this price range.
3) Accurate connectivity via Bluetooth.
4) System gives the best Sound quality even with Aux connectivity.
5) You will get the best Sound quality with Bluetooth,HDMI ARC,Optical and AUX respectively.
6) USB input to play mp3 files.
7) HDMI ARC Support.

Cons:
1) Lot of Wire Management required.
2) Provides only AUX cable with the box. Optical cable and HDMI cable to be buy separately.

Overall Verdict:
Guys just go for it if you are looking for a home theatre system below 15K. It gives best sound output with all inputs. Bluetooth or HDMI ARC are first choice of connectivity. Even Aux won’t disappoints you. Do not go for any 2.1 channel setup if you have the budget of 15K. I even tried JBL SB 160 in this range but this is cool. This is SONY Boss it will never disappoints you.

Note: Make sure your HDMI cable version is 2.0. Then only ARC will work.",5

At my first use I ordered black one this was good. Colour doesn't matter but feature is still good.previous one I use almost 19 months after it's one ear not work properly may be because of issue in wire still I think

Delivery is on time and I m happy with that. Thanks Amazon.",5
"I am a vfx artist and color accuracy matters to me. When I was ordering LG 32QN600, I was a bit skeptical because of its cheap price for its size, resolution and features, and the fact that the panel is actually made by BOE (Chinese company). But the reviews were good so I took the leap of faith. And now that I have it, I am blown away. It has put my old Dell Ultrasharp to shame. As you can see in the image attached, the colors of this monitor are much closer to my iPad Air 3 compared to my old Dell. I am very satisfied with the picture quality. IPS glow is minimal, white/grey/blacks are perfectly neutral. No tint whatsoever to the naked eye. Don't expect amazing HDR at this price point. However this is just an initial reaction. I am yet to see how reliable is it for long working hours.",5
"Very Good product.Gives accurate readings.In present senario very helpful to monitor temp,heart rate , blood pressure and saturation within one gadget.Excersize and sleep tracking is good.with additive advantage of smart watch",5

"Review posted when i didn't have power backup:
After 1 month of use, not even giving 1 hr backup. Initial days backup was 4-5 hrs (highest I got)

Update after few years when I have power backup now:
Changed ratings from 3 star to 5 star.
I have power backup at my home, however there is few secs of gap when power goes and the backup starts. In this sec interval the wifi will go off too. But the product is a life saver when you work from home. You will never be disconnected from wifi and no worry of getting dropped during meetings. Do not know about the backup time now. But it serves my purpose.",5
"Amazing headphone, Excellent quality, Great sound, Bass is adequately loud you can feel the vibration on your ears, if you are looking for thumping bass it will go for you, Vocals are clear and you and even hear every single detail in the song and the best of it,s battery backup. Build quality is great and these headphones are quite comfortable. And you get 3.5mm jack and 6.5mm jack on it. Perfect for music lovers and gamers.l strongly recommend this product.",5
"One word for this speakers ""BEAST""
One of the best 4.1 speakers you will get under this range.
Go for it guys anytime.
Cheers Zebronics 🍻👍",5
"Overall: I have purchased it for ACT broadband (connection is via RJ45 aka LAN from ACT). It was very easy to configure. I like the dashboard (home page) of the router, because it summarises all info (like how many clients connected- via LAN, via Wifi, other info, etc.). I already have other TPLink modem-routers but it's dashboard is very good.

Speed: I shall add the review about the offered high-speed transfer (5 GHz) from device to device. I have to try it with two Laptops and to check the speed & distance/obstacles/walls between the devices/router.",5
"Awesome
Camera quality is good
Good battery life
After using it from one month I'm giving this review
Awesome product 👍",5
"Product is very good and compatible with BSNL. Setting is also easy, but it is not as per attached catalogue. Dlink should modify steps of configuration so that common man can easily configure the product.",5

"Yes it has fulfilled my requirements. It's not for big 🏠 , The best part is I had called up Linksys help desk for guidance to install and pair with my Jio Fibre router. At that time I am not able to complete the process due to my Laptop hangup. The technician from Linksys has taken my next available time and she has helped me beyond her official closing time. Five star for Linksys helpdesk.",5

I expected a small printer but it is some what bigger than they illustrate and the printer gives best quality printing than the laser printer and it is easy to setup initially I don't know anything about the product installation but they give a nice explanation how to do installation that's a added advantage. It looks pretty good and there are many other good also but it's enough here.,5

"I am really fully content with the product. It reached me within two days with everything content in it and no doubt in a very good condition. It may be somewhat difficult for the beginners but it will not take a long to learn. If you are choosing between canon and Nikon I will suggest you canon because of its real colour capturing and fine focus of its lenses. You can get more slightly more features in Nikon than canon at the same price but that doesn't mean that will surely better than canon. You can look for contrast between canon and Nikon in the internet. I think it will suggest you the same""canon"".",5

"Canon Pixma 3000,print quality is excellent ,mobile printing by Redmi 4 good quality only thing is that it prints a small photograph size,not very easy to install ,I had asked the installation through Khandwa customer care who came within 24hrs after the request was sent ,despite hot summers in Khargone he came by bus to the village changing two buses and installed the printer,but it needs a better version of Windows to install on desktop but my version is if 2013,Easy to use by push of buttons.Ink supplement in good quantity 2extra bottles of black .Manufactured in Vietnam with MRP of Rs 15455/-but after the full discount was made value for money by Amazon and the final value was Rs 9261/- only.

"I purchased it in October. It's amazingly working. I faced no issue till now. There are plenty of wallpapers which you can select according to your mood. I don't know how accurate the heart rate/stress monitor is, but I realized I'm turning a bit bad due to my laziness. But now I can keep track of everything and this can be a must add-on to anyone's lifestyle. If you're looking for a good Fitbit then I would say you to go for this with a blind fold. I hoped for more features on this price mark but I feel it is worth buying.",5

All description matches the product delivered.",5

"If your budget is strictly restricted up to Rs.15K and you're not willing to buy any Chinese brand, then M11 is unanimously a smart choice. Build and aesthetics are really impressive, none less than a higher end model. Battery supports fast charging giving you 100% charge in 2.5hrs.
Picture clarity and sharpness is quite good as well. Although Samsung could have provided bigger camera in the price range like other smartphones does, but still 13MP is more than sufficient unless you're into professional photography. Response and Touch-Sensitivity is amazing, no lag or hang problem till now. Packaging was really good, no damage to the box as well",5
Good sound quality and good design,5
Product is very good could give more fancy watch faces,5
Superb product.. must buy.Compared to the picture the item is very small in size .,5

Anyway a fantastic product by tp-link",5
Look is awesome,5
"Thoroughly satisfied in the 2 days I've been using the router. Every inch of my 1200sqft home is fully covered when I place the router in a central room.

The setup took a few hours of trial and error since I wasn't fully sure about the configuration of my local Internet provider, but I finally managed to get it working by just following the configuration wizard that comes with the CD. Serves me right for ignoring the glaring red warning label imploring me run the wizard from the CD before attempting to connect to the router.",5
It's good best but one thing I didn't like that it came without earphones and tempered glass,5
Handy to new users. But sometimes auto focus not work properly.,5
Purpose served,5
"One of the good options when it comes to buying monitors. The price might seem a bit high but the product is of top quality. Monitor can be customized to one's preferences using the menu options present. It's a proper FHD 1080p. The bezel less borders make it better. All features described are present.

Only bad thing for me is that there is only 1 HDMI port. Would've preferred another one instead of the DVI. Also the screen can't be adjusted too much vertically but that's not really an issue for me.",5
"One of best ear phone i used in my life. I used this for more than 1.5 years but i lost this so I ordered same earphone , nice fitting to ear and noise cancelationon, excellent bass.
Go through this",5
Very happy with the product Good packing On time delivery,5
Very good monitor. Don't know about too many technical details. But eyes and neck don't feel the pain even after long days of work. Adjustable stand and light filters are really good.,5
"Build quality is very good. Cushions are very soft so it is comfortable for long time usage. Bettery is also good. Bluetooth is also very good. And also u will get Aux cable although it isn't mentioned in accessories. And most important thing sound and bass quality which very very good. U can buy this product. Trust me
u won't regret.",5

"I bought this offline for 12990/-. I had to replace it as it was defective.
As for the sound quality, it delivers beyond my expectations. Before buying this, I had a JBL BAR 3.1 which I sold online on ""___ pe bech de"" app😜.
I had to sell the jbl one because the mids were not audible at all so we were not able to enjoy r.d. burman songs which have generous use of bass guitar.
The sound quality is amazing! The entire frequency spectrum can be heard clearly without the bass being offensive. This is a great system for such a low price tag. Plus my mother wanted fm which it has with great reception and quality.
Pros:
1. Great sound quality. Very soothing and relaxing with a punchy bass.
2. Low price
3. Able.to play via bluetooth, optical cable, auxiliary cable, fm, usb.
4. Can be used as tower speakers or as a 2.1 sound bar.

Cons:
1. Build quality could have been better. Not the materials used but the assembly. Even with the replaced piece, the woofer front cover is loose which vibrates when bass is increased.
2. Remote is fairly responsive.

Overall this piece is good. Just check it after unboxing for operational defects because the build quality is so-so. At such a low price you get fm, bt, usb, optical, aux! What more do you want...!",5
Nice Headphone with good sound quality...,5
"Good overall,",5
"Easy setup to configure your broadband settings into this tp link router.

"The installation was not at all easy. Even I tried myself but needed assistance. The WiFi range is not too much

"I have attached 2 pictures that reflect the picture quality of the camera. as you can see 1 of the picture is from daylight and the second one is from night view. though night vision is not up to mark well I can understand they mentioned about night vision range they mentioned that this is a camera is for indoor security purposes...

3 Connectivity: 5 out of 5

Super excited to see,5
Pic Quality is Fine but not that much Awwful..but any way happy with quality and you to keep colour backup specially black..it consuming a lot #PaisaVasool,5
"I got this router (Tenda AC5) mainly to address the WiFi 4 (2.4GHz) network congestion in my area (there are many WiFi networks in my area on 2.4GHz which adversely used to affect my network range and stability). To say the least, it has exceeded my expectations. Both the WiFi 4 & 5 signals cover our entire flat (1000 sq.ft.) seamlessly. I have a 60 mbps connection and get the full speed (58-59mbps) on both bands. For the LAN part, it has Fast Ethernet ports and there is no loss of speed in that part either. The router can easily manage 10+ devices of mine without breaking a sweat, thanks to the 1 GHz processor and 64 MB RAM.

Coming to the Web UI, it's easy to use but powerful at the same time. There are options like PPTP server, DMZ, Virtual Server, sleeping mode, DDNS,a basic firewall for flood attack defense, LED on/off function (for turning off the router LED's manually/automatically), Guest network, and a lot more. An awesome feature of this router is that it can be linked to a Tenda cloud account and can then be managed via the Tenda mobile app locally/remotely over any internet connection. TP-Link also provides a similar app but the Tenda app is much more functional.

Bottom line - if you have an internet connection of 100mbps or less, this router is well worth the price. Many people will say that the 867mbps 5GHz band is useless since all the LAN/WAN ports are 100mbps, but in reality, since the 2.4GHz band is generally congested, you'll probably never get the full 100mbps unless you're on the 5GHz band. Also, the connection is going to be far more stable on 5GHz.",5
As the antenna's are 5db and there 2 of them so the connectivity is superior. Works like a charm with multiple devices. It also offers MAC ID duplication which can be used to mimic your earlier router MAC ID to run your connection in case your ISP has locked the service to the MAC ID of your old router.,5
Very good product for me.And very easy to install also.Very much usefull product,5
Best wifi in this budget. Works as charm. Value for money .Go for it,5

1. Samsung screens doesn't need a intro. Even other mobile manufacturer's are buying screens from samsung only. So screen quality is top notch😍.

2. It is a IPS panel, viewing angles good. Inky black. Good contrast. Great brightness. No backlight issue most important to choose this.

3. Comes with hdmi cable and power cable. No VGA anyhow I don't need that, but if you need you have to buy it separately.

4. Installation is easy and wall mountable. Planning to make it as a second tv after WFH over 😝

Cons.
Price again it is not a cons. Would have been great if it is little cheaper.

Overall great purchase and good Monitor",5

Along with this, the coaches support us constantly for our fitness. Doctors are also available for support. At this time when almost all are moving towards obesity and heart attacks. You should buy Goqii Watch for your fitness.",5
"I still has a working TP-Link router but that sucks in the range. I was getting the range even in 2 BHK flat. I choose Tenda because of excellent reviews on its range and it has really wide and strong range. Setup is really easy.
Tip : To get perfect range you need to adjust the antenna position optimally. Use any network speed app and try with different antenna position and you will able to get perfect range. You can also read some articles about setting up router antenna in optimal position.",5

No backlight bleeding. ( 1080p ips display)
Highly height, angle and rotation adjustable.
4 usb ports ( 2 usb 3.0 on left side )
Chosen this monitor after lot of comparisons, reviews and the risks
Bought for Rs 13,990. Compared to other 24 inch monitor, this is little expensive because of the quality and brand value.
I'm sure this monitor will run for 10 years :)
I promise you love this if you have budget of 14000 .",5
Received the product on 2nd June and it's been 3 days since. Charged up the watch to 100% on 2nd June and since using it continuously with All day heart rate tracking on and all features turned on. Screen feels slight laggy sometimes however no major issues in responsiveness. Also in the 3 day continuous usage battery dropped only 18%. Build is of Plastic however the Dial due to its metallic looks make it feel premium. Music control and Camera Shutter control also works properly.,5
"I don't often write reviews but read a lot of them, and wanted to put this out there to help anyone considering this router.

When I was comparing different lower cost routers it seemed like every product had negative reviews and pointed out flaws, to the point where it gave me pause on buying ANYTHING at all.

But bottom line this is a very good router for the price, simple to set up, and I recommend it BIGLY

1. Good reception in 1000 sq foot house. I have used multiple devices and streamed video with no problem.
2. SO SIMPLE to set up - right out of box, connect cord, plug in power, and use the SSID and password printed on the S/N label - no need to log in and do any configuration

Do not despair upon reading all the reviews and just order this if you're looking cheap router for average house hold use.",5

Good watch to buy at this price range and it have all basis features,5
"Works flawlessly as a range extender with JioFi 3 when we select mode 2 in WDS modes. The default 'auto' mode and mode 1 have some compatibility issues with JioFi 3 but might work with other routers/modems.

The 2.5GHz signal is really strong. All in all, the best router at 2.7k INR especially because, as per my research, this one is the only router at this price range that has four gigabit LAN ports!",5
Good sound and best quality,5
Great Battery life,5

"After using this specific model 9970 for 6 months let me change my earlier comment.
1.Mine gave way in around 6months
2.Claimed warranty and got a new piece
3.Found the new one too to have the same issue

Thing is unlike 8961 which is the previous version of TP link 9970 this modem router drops connection like insane.Sometimes the wifi connection to ur phone or firestick or something else will drop and nmew device may not find the router at all till u restart the modem.This is wat the issue is.It could be a software issue i guess but this is horrible.I am already planning to switch",5
Very good and clear 2.1 channel speakers for the money. Happy with purchase so far.,5
The product is great. The signal is very strong. I have JioFober and I've extended my connection with this router with a 100ft ethernet cable. The speed is undisturbed. The setup is easy and everything is working great. Security protection is also good. We can disable WPS to safeguard the connection. The dual signal is great.,5
"This mobile fullfilled my all requirements .
Awsome phone ....",5
"Descent quality, value for money, sound quality ia good, good for office calls/VCs. Wire quality is long lasting",5
Best picture quality freesync amd smooth game performance,5
"Good design.
Battery initially gives reasonable backup of 6-7 hours, but may reduce on prolonged use.
Display is not good but manageable as it seems a bit faded.
Hinge is not the strongest , as I have been used to strong build quality of dell laptops.
Boot up and memory use is fast due to SSD.
Processor is also good.
All in all a value for money product as I got it for 40k",5
Print Quality is prefect,5

A complete product with important features at a very nice affordable price. Specially liked the Spo2 feature.,5
Got it delivered in 3 days. I thought it was a hyped up wearable but I was wrong. I have used mi band 2 previously and this mi band 4 is a real upgrade in terms of features. Just go for it because no other band stand a chance against it. The only con I was able to find is its pricing I wish it had a price tag of 2000 then no body would have second thoughts.,5
An awesome purchase. I was hesitant to buy it by reading the false information stating that it wont work with BSNL. I took feedback from personal contacts and bought it. It really works well. Hassle free install and configuration. Well documented install and configure steps are very simple to follow.,5
The display and battery is just awesome compare to samsung fit which i was using for almost 1 year and it give battery life of 4 days but MI BAND 4 is just awesome in every expect and there is only one con is the strap it must be in three to four colors choice,5
Wonderful system,5

"Awesome BASS. Had bought a SONY CH510, BOAT ROCKERZ400 but felt the Bass was not upto the expected levels. So returned them and tried this based on the reviews. Product is truly superb. The beats literally vibrate in your ears. Worth the money, just go for it.",5
"Can even support 50mbps connections.
But gr8 for upto 20-40 mbps",5
Signal quality is very good and they are also very easy to use,5
"good and able to access from every corner of my 1500 SqFt apartment,",5
"Good product.Good product, excellent price and delivered in time.",5
"I have a broad band connection with WiFi router. Whenever there was a power outage, even though we had a generator backup in the building it would take few seconds to start. During this period, once the power was down the router would go off and would take couple of minutes to start once the generator was switched on. Same would happen when power would resume and line would switch back to main from generator backup. So Everytime the power was down and power would resume, the router would go off one take couple of minutes to start. This was very disturbing and frustrating while working on something important.
Then, I got to know about this product 'Resonate Router UPS' while browsing through Amazon products and ordered it immediately. Since then there is no looking back. Resonate was very to install with the help of the instruction manual provided with the product. It hardly took couple of minutes to install and since then the router has never been switched off.
Resonate Router UPS' is very reasonable and a handy product to have.",5
"Very nice coverage
And
Very good network",5
"This product is definitely worth your money, you get a complete health ecosystem with the tracker. You get a 3 month health coaching subscription (coaches, doctors, experts review your data from the device and on the basis of that advice you how to improve your health).

"Camera is not remarkable,battery life is good, finger print is good",5
Good. Longer reach.,5
Nothing more to say! It is good,5
"This is the best smartphone in the entry level segment. User gets all the important features like big battery, huge storage, better performance as it gets Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 processor. The stereo speakers also does the job perfectly while you listen to your favourite music or watch your favorite videos. Negative points: One can't expect more in this price range as you get an average but not bad camera. The pre installed bloatware, Sammy notifications are irritating, which I think the company must wipe out bringing an update soon. Overall, a Value for Money phone.👍",5
"This product was my first order with Amazon and I am absolutely satisfied with Amazon's services and the product. I was apprehensive of buying online considering the lack of Customer Service observed earlier in India, before Amazon arrived. But with Amazon's excellent service and return policies, this has changed.
The product is working fine since I bought it, 10 months back. I keep it switched on throughout the day and it works perfectly without any issues (it does get a little warm at the bottom of the router). With a 5db antenna, the Wi-Fi signal range is also good and I am able to access it from the inner most room of my 1300 sq ft house. At this price this is the best in the lot.",5
Initially found some connectivity issue later on issue has been resolved... I ordered this because of oxygen level and pulse rate and its good substitute of oximeter.. i guess its worth,5
"Nice phone, with battery life is too good.",5
"Very good user interface.
Easy to install.
Looks good, compact size.
Can be used as a router, repeater, WISP client.
But no power button on the device.",5
Worth for money. I ordered i ball tharang seeing the positive review but the bass and sound quality was very low. I made a risk to order philips 4.1 speaker inspite of many negative reviews but it is really worth. The product serve its purpose well. Go for it,5
Very nice product no problems faced at all. With easy setup. Amazing speed you can do anything in minutes. Must buy product.,5

Good product in low price .. impressive,5
Everything works fine and printing quality depends on the ink. The stock cartridge ink works like charm. The color cartride after 3-4 refills stops detecting by the printer even when it's full with ink which I think is a scam of printer business. But the black cartridge still works whenever it got empty I refill it and it's works. The printer works with single cartridge too! But the cartridge are very costly to buy,5
Superb Product: Very easy to install and WiFi is good. I use WiFi in my room that is separated by a wall.,5
"Best earphones you can get at this price point. Sound is very crisp and clear. Bass is adequate not overwhelming. One drawback though, at higher volumes sound can be heard by surrounding people. Just be careful with the thin wires.",5

very helpful band.ddont care about negitive reviews...lovd it,5
I use this everyday for almost everything and it has been consistent and appropriate in its working!,5
WiFi signal is average even though it has an external antenna. It heats up a bit. It's functional and works 24x7 without any disconnection.,5
A perfect setup for home use. Its range is very impressive i get signal even outside my home. In open market its prize was about 750/- & on amazon i got it in only 580/-. What else will u ask for in this prize? More than happy,5
"Bought it from local store. Here are the reason why u should get it:
-Factory calibrated
-99% srgb

-ips panel
And its the only good 4k monitor available in india for fair price.",5

Easy to configure. Works well,5

Great backup,5
Uninterrupted strong WiFi signal.,5
AMAZFIT IS A GOOD PRODUCT,5
"Yet another terrific product from TP-Link, tried out the dual bank router up in delivery and everything seems to be in order. The colour of the rounder is a bit darker than what is displayed online, more like a very deep blue almost next to black but apart from that I’d recommend it to anyone who’d want to buy a dual band router for their various needs.",5
Cost worth..features good,5
Nice mobile. At the beginning battery drained 😴very quickly after few days. It automatically adjusted and now better,5
"User guide should have been more simpler and easy to configure via mobile, few things are not clear , post some investigations /playing with apps - user can configure, overall its good",5
"Watch is good , but the app (zepp app) is the worst , sometimes its not even connecting , now i can't change my watch face , tracking activities is good , have a good accuracy rate , apart from the app , its worth buying.",5
Excellent image quality,5

"Sir product is very good and appreciable...
I would recommend all of you.
Please buy this product.
It is very useful.",5
"This is an awesome router that I did not expect to get at this price. All options are there. The setup did not require anything. It is almost plug and play. But a CD and print instructions are provided. It has good signal than airtel router I had previously. For people s***ing to DSL and setting up second router, this is a great router to buy!",5
"The sound quality is awesome as that is what you can expect from JBL but the wire quality is poor as it is made of rubber which on getting jerk could be damaged, but the sound quality is awesome as these are the beat budget earphones I have ever used.",5
it's been 2 years since I've got this router.. trust me its awesome.. easy to install.. comes with a user manual and dvd,5
Good and helpful,5
Product is good but FM radio is not tuning properly.,5

One of the best products in the category,5
Awesome quality purchased 3 nos in Amazon sale,5
"Bought for 1300 rupees. Worth the price. Print quality is really good. However it consumes more ink than expected. But good for household use, where you print once in 7-10 days.",5
Nice product. Using at my 2BHK home and covers the whole house. Delivery was on time. Highly recommend for homes and small offices.,5
"Loved it. Wasn't too happy with the one that was provided with MTNL broadband. This one does the job.

Happy to recommend to everyone.",5
"i like this phone, battery level is good also camera in under 8000/-",5
Good Product in this price range,5
This is the second time I have ordered this router (first still works fine). Best you can get in this price range or even 500-1000 higher. Good signal strength and range. Very easy to setup. Far superior range than tp link router (2 Antenna) and default bsnl router I used to use. Asus single antenna router also has good range.,5
"The good thing about this monitor is that it comes with 1 d-sub, 2 HDMI, 1 audio jack. I am using this monitor for my laptop, my CPU, and also my android tv stick. See how many ways you can use a single monitor. It also has a 1080p resolution which gives me a good view, my laptop has a 720p resolution. There is no doubt that this monitor is way useful for many things. LG has done a good thing but this product comes from China which I didn't like.",5
Purchased product for daughter to attend classes. Very happy with it,5
"I Purchased this product on 26th Feb 2015 and it delivered in within a span of two days.

Still exploring the features though and since like the camera I am too a beginner..we'll take some time to understand each other. So far so good. For now I can comment on the packaging
It comes with 2 lenses as already communicated in the features, Battery and charger. Also camera bag quality is superb. Thanks Amazon for fast service and superb deal. Will share thefeedback on performance after usage of some time",5

"Well, it meets my conditions and requirements. The LAN port of this modem stops working sometimes although it starts working again after resetting the router. But resetting the router again again causes some error. I will recomment ot for those who want to use it as a repeater otherwise go with some else.",5
Print quality is awesome,5
"Just bought it a day ago and I was surprised to see how easy it was to install. It comes with various pins so can actually work different kind of supported supported router. There was a power cut in between but didn't even notice it because wifi kept working.
This is a must have product for anyone who works from home.",5
Ordered on 31st Jan and got it delivered on 2nd Feb. It's pure a flagship phone. The feeling of the phone is very premium. I highly recommend you to buy if you have the budget.,5

Excellent printer. I got it for 9500 during sale . Print from Mobile easily. Integrated inktank. Must buy . Cheapest product with this features,5
Thank you amazon,5
"Over a period of 5 months, these have held up really well
The sound is rather bass heavy, as the name suggests, but can be tuned to your wish by any equalizer to a large extent to favour vocals or just reduce bass
The passive noise cancellation is fine and these are not heavy, so are easily portable",5
Sleep tracking is very nice but the heart beat monitoring system is not as expected,5
Excellent... Total value for money,5
"A watch at this Price range with GPS, SPO2, Heart Sensor etc. is simply awesome. Super happy to have this watch.

Just add watch faces on regular basis.

If you have a budget of around 7K go for it.",5
"I got my earphones delivered today. Packaging was nice. Inside the packet there was earphones, a pouch for safe keeping of earphones and 2 extra pair of buds. The performance was very good. The sound quality, bass and noise cancellation was very good. So it was a very good product at a reasonable price.",5
"At current price around 40k(after discounts) this is the most balanced smartphone you can buy. I'm not saying it has the best specs overall at the price point, but to be fair, none of us will really see the difference between Snapdragon 865 and 888, or 8GB ram or 12 gb ram, unless you are really pushing it. I would say it is a better deal than OnePlus 9R for sure, even OnePlus 9 for that matter(as it lacks in OIS for back cam 🤐). You won't regret buying this one.",5
The best gaming headset for budget gamers under rs 1000. Very good bass with the 50mm drivers but not for listening music as it's a gaming headset. And for gaming it's legendary. I can hear the footsteps in CS:GO and PUBG. Rgb LEDs will melt you hearts.,5
BEST FOR RS 7600,5
I was received yesterday... Frankly said value for money in this price... Quality vise good sound perfect bass ok superior and fine quality if you want go these price range so definitely buy these products,5

Good product but delievery took 1 week,5
"Bought this for my friend , tenda is awesome",5
The headphone is the best in this price range. The sound quality is amazing. The best feature is that it has two aux ports. It's perfect for those who have trouble connecting this device via bluetooth to their PC. The sound quality is amazing using both bluetooth and aux cable.,5
Purpose fulfilled. I am using it on First floor and I am getting full range on first floor as well as 1 to 3 polls on Ground Floor. Easy to install and reconnects within a minute after turning it on.,5
Nice mobile and good looking... good battery backup and Amazon person was very nice to deliver the product I am proud to buy products to Amazon,5
"The device was thinner than I expected it to be. I was using the boat Progear before this one, and this is like a breath of fresh air after that last band. The screen is more than adequately bright, with deep blacks that AMOLED offers. The watch faces are a bit on the lower side, but we can customize them and even add our own wallpapers, so that makes up for it.
I was a little bummed about the fitness tracking modes (badminton is an essential to me), but freestyle is a jack of all trades mode, and that solves my issue.
The other new features Xiaomi has added, such as pai, and better sleep tracking (also tracks naps) are a welcome.
The accuracy I felt was a bit off when I manually checked it by walking and then counting steps, but I'll have to extensively test to verify if it is within the margin of error. Right now it seems fine.
Overall, it's a great value for money product.",5
Tp link router strength and signal is very Awesome I am very happy to say that the router is very good to all customers in this budget range,5
"Great fully satisfy, with product and services",5
"Featured phone in budget.. better battery, camera and ram as per price Phone.",5
Done know it would be this way to install. Fownloaded the app and its way very clear. I have ACT fibernet with 100mbps and I get 99 on 5gz and 60 on 2.4. cant complain,5
The product quality is so good and sound is also great am grateful as a customer of amazon,5
"I used the CRV12V2 with my 4G LTE VoLTE router thay takes a SIM card (pictured), in this case a Jio SIM card, and connected this router to a cordless, powered landline phone (I am creating this set up for my father's remote farm). This router's adapter is rated for 12 V, 1.0 A.

To test this UPS' life, after everything was switched on, and it was fully charged overnight, I left it only on the UPS power and went to work at 1:45 pm, after taking out the adapter from the plug point. Note, the WiFi router was not being used for an internet connection at this time when I was at work, even though it was switched on; no device was connected to the WiFi. Nevertheless, I was expecting it to work till about 5:45 pm since the manufacturer said that it will last for upto 4 hours. I tested this by calling that Jio SIM periodically all through the workday, and if it rang, the router is switched on.

The result? It just kept successfully ringing, all the way till 11 pm that day! I came home at 12:15 am, and the router was still switched on, just powered off this UPS!!!! THAT'S FANTASTIC!

Now, I know that the life of the battery will be lower if the WiFi is being used to browse the internet, but, still, this is a very good experience! Beyond expectations! I am sure it wkll last the promised 4 hours at least!

There's no other product in the market as good as this, designed as well as this, with so many clear instructions that are easy to follow.

Well done, Resonate!!!!",5

However the performance is awsome if one is well versed with Manual settings",5

This is a very good product and worth buying. The battery backup is also ver good. Every specification of the item is so good and are very much accurate. The only disadvantage is that if the notifications are turned on the battery will be drained more. It has the option only to cut the call and you cannot use it for speaking. The final word I can say is that the product is superb.,5
Touch screen is awsome. Need to be more accurate. And battery life is good.,5
My earlier router was not good enough to support video calls. This one is working good.,5

"It's a very useful gadget to analyse physical activities like walking, treadmill, sleeping, driving, swimming, running etc. including heart rate. The device may analyse daily activities with precision. I thin the accuracy of the data collected by the gadget maybe ±3%. Battery life is excellent, may not be need to recharge the battery within 10 - 12 days. The wrist band is very comfortable.",5
Provides more features and reliable for the price it comes.,5
I bough this for my home use and very much satisfied.,5
"Good features such as sleep tracking, tells you hours of deep sleep and light sleep. Has five excercise modes to keep a track of calories. Step counter is quite accurate. Best feature is that i can control music from it so i dont have to unlock my phone to change the track while running or working out. You can easily select which app notifications you want. Great value for money.",5
After a lot of review researching and price check I took a decision to buy this Monitor and I have to say that I am very satisfied with my decision of buying it. The anti glare technology works so amazing and that's a plus point while I edit my pictures in a bright lit room with no reflection. The colour quality (RGB) is also perfect and the viewing angles are great what else do you need in a monitor at this price. I haven't tried my hands in gaming but would definitely like to try it. But for now I am totally satisfied with the product.,5

"Love the following:

Good looking.,5
"i was bit confused before buying this product but it's great ! , it offers passive noise cancelling which means that you would not be able to listen to external sound when volume is set high.
else you could easily hear outdoor sounds . - people talking etc.
it's quite durable and could easily withstand many jolts . ( durability is indeed very important )
best buy under 1k.",5
"This is one of the best quality wireless neck band with mic available in market.
Ptron always rock the segment with the price and the quality .

Nice budget phone for those people who not buy expensive phone,5
"After reading these reviews where some people really didn't like it and where some people loved it, I got really skeptical. I probably was about to cancel my order. But I got it anyways and It's so good. It fits my ears perfectly, it doesn't pain even after hours of usage. The sound is more than loud enough with enough bass and also has this really good theater effect. Kinda makes me look like a gamer girl not gonna lie lmao. But, anyways. So far my experience has been good. And yes it might be a little delicate but which headphones are not??? Just buy it guys don't fall for the bad reviews this headset is beautiful!!!",5

"Not an expert in sounds, but good one for regular use",5
"Good one, Go for it",5
"I owned Redgear Headphones before which I used for 6 years and they finally broke after rough use. These are better in build quality and the sound is really good. I have Dolby atmos for PC and they sure improve the Sound quality. There is not much difference between these and Logitech gaming headphones. They are good for entry-level gamers who have a budget for accessories. The RGB lights cannot be controlled, They keep glowing. The mic is really good, No static and background Noise",5
"Working fine, signal strength issues faced with other make resolved",5
The speed of the woifi is great. The range is a bit low for 5g . But the rest is great,5

Excellent for Home Useage.,5
Ordered on 17 june received on 21 june and today on 17 October one side of earpiece stopped working i rather suggest to buy samsung ehs 64 which is working for last 3 years.,5
It is far better than MI one. It's about more than 10 months am using this ear phone. It's working supr. Whereas mi comes for only 2months,5
"Awesome sound quality best I have heard out of 20 earphones/headphones I have. Bass is normal definitely not for bass heads. Misleading branding.
I am not a bass head so it's extremely enjoyable for me. But if bass was on little heavier side this would be #1 in all headphones.",5
This is an awesome monitor and has a lot of modes. Each mode has it's own display configurations and suite various purposes. HDR effect is good and 4K videos feel lifelike.,5
I initially purchased a costly TP-Link device but had to return the same due to low range. This device is cheaper and better. Even the build quality is better. I would recommend this router.,5
Good headphones for the price,5
"It's been more than 5 months using this earphone, still no complaint. Everything is working fine. I wanted a earphone with mic and this is perfect. Very light weight and earbud fits well in the ear. You can use for longer time because it is light weight.",5
It's relly nice .....but the step tracking is not so correct..it sometimes countsb 10 more steps than I walk.... otherwise everything is good...and sleep tracking is fabulous,5
Great product love it,5
"Samsung has made amazing phone in this cost really good in this budget,am using this as secondary phone and its also a great performance in this segment",5
Distance calculation done with GPS tracking is perfect. Lots of watch faces also available in the app store even you can customise watch face background. Music listening via bluetooth headsets is now very easily and controlled hassle free thorough this band. Providing Good battery backup also and best in the budget.,5
Very good working redmi note 9 but invoice bill not inside box please send me invoice,5

"I really like this band ever ,it's comfortable to wear, it's perfect accuracy and tracking sleep, multiple display music and much more I really love this band,",5
Its a good upgrade over its predecessors. It has a better accuracy in terms of Heart Rate. Stress test and breathing exercise is a berrer add on. Foot step accuracy still needs improvement but its not very bad. Overall the watch is nice and worth buying. I hope this review helps.,5
A budget smartphone must buy,5
Nice product. Homely useful,5
I can guarantee you that you cannot find better headphones under this price point. The headphones have a great amount and quality of bass for all the bass lovers out there. Sound quality is awesome.. Wire is thick and durable with a protective spring attached to its jack. The only downside is the looks. Not very attractive and mic cannot work with pc.,5
Tnx amazon,5
Very good product. I bought this at ₹999. Easy to install and wide range coverage.,5
"So far so good. The device is working fine. Samsung products are good but too much of bloatware. We can do without the unnecessary apps that have been preloaded. It would be a far better option to allow owners of the product to choose which apps are useful for them. Secondly, there should be an option to Uninstall all the unnecessary applications which are hogging space and memory",5
good battery,5
This router works great.,5
Thank you for good product,5
This product rocks the coverage and speed is very good. For this price its a best router.,5

"Super battry life......

Sometime lag....idont know why.",5
"In one word it's just awesome and best camera. Before buying I search and gather information about cctv camera .And then i contacted some local cctv provider for my store..All are local cctv provider was told me a huge price for cctv approx 18k to 22k so when i told then about IP camera they said it comes high price but good. In my locality every shop have cctv camera I checked them but believe me all are waste of money no clear picture even day time face is not clear .And maily issue for me is wiring .DVR camera comes with many wire and big hardisk which is very bad for me.So i bought this camara with 128gb memory card now you check my night picture what a clear picture . Beside medicine shop owner check and said what is this how can be too clear they have DVR camara which is not clear and also not watching from home..It's cheap and best i can control from my home with internet.
Pros :
1. Clear night vision ( Check my photo)
2.cute look..
3.Control from home
4.SD card recording i can watch from phone no need to insert laptop or like that
Cons :
1 Only sound is very eco so road side shop is problem
2 .I used storage 128gb but 24/7 recording block 8 gb per day so calculate it",5
"Build quality awsome,comfortable to use,crystal and clear sound thank you nirvana😍",5

"Wow, superb router. Covers my two adjacent houses perfectly. Little big size. Easy 1 minute setup. Must buy.",5

I use Bass Booster in Pi Music player's equalizer to get Extra Bass, and it's really amazing.
Build quality is also good, 4 earphone earbuds inside the package. Totally happy with the purchase .

"After using almost 1 year iam writing this review,
Battery backup:5/5
Sleep tracking:4/5
Bluetooth connectivity:3.5/5
Steps tracking:4/5
Heart rate tracking:4.2/5
Accuracy:3/5
Notifications for calls and messages:4/5
Belt durability:2.5/5, because after using almost 6 months it was broken completely (but it depends on your usage)
Scratches on screen will be more effective so buy a screen guard for it.
Overall experience with mi band is good,I recommend to buy it.",5
"good sound, best quality",5
"I was facing random call drops (for say 2-3 seconds) frequently using my old router and also received a bandwidth of around 3-4 Mbps in my third room. It's been almost a month using TP-Link AC1200 Archer A6 version 3 now, have hardly faced any disturbance in internet connectivity and also getting around 15-20 Mbps speed in my third room. I have a 50 Mbps plan for which I get full speed in adjacent rooms to where the router is placed. One thing I was looking for is to limit the bandwidth speed on specific devices, but with QoS option, I can just give high priority to devices I want. Also if a wireless router is connected to the router (as a repeater), it is not detected as part of connected clients to the router. However, overall I'm happy with it. Also if you're not in a hurry, keep tracking its price, I purchased it for 2149 INR rupees finally.
Also please purchase ""TP-Link AC1200 Archer A6 version 3"" as its the latest model and has more features in AC1200 category that purchasing version 2 or TP-Link AC1200 Archer C6 or TP-Link AC1200 Archer C60.",5
Really good product give all important notification about ur health. five star for sleep tracking mobile app and accuracy,5
"Fine product not good or not bad

So far giving very good performance.,5
I like the product as is display is realy good and look is very sporty,5

Good product. Using it since 2 months without any issue.,5
great product. I didnt want to use the ftth router as it was only 2.4 gz with weak antennas. attached this to that router and did auto installation. works like a charm. 15% faster speeds as compared to the ftth provided router.,5
"It's a amazing product, during the lockdown I had to purchase this one without knowing much about the brand still I took this Boat Earphone and it turn out to be one of the amazing experience to have it. Post this purchase I have taken 3 more to gift to my friends and family.",5

"It's size is really smaller than the other routers I have generally seen...
Has good coverage (tested it for signal strength till 25 meters with walls and doors in between and it dropped only 1 stick of 4)...
Observed 0 loss of bandwidth...
No visible latency...
Can be configured to divide bandwidth to different devices connected..
Also liked the Amazon's delivery. .shipped within 4 days (travelling +1600kms) given that my place is not such a big hotspot for delivery system
Overall...awsome!!",5
"hey guys, one word ""EXCELLENT"" describes it well. I am writing this review after a weeks usage.
first of all thanks to amazon people for providing fast delivery with least price among contemporaries.
I had an airtel broadband at home since past 9 years and thought of adding a wi-fi router since past 2 year. as i am not aware of what technical specifications to look in a router before buying, so i kept postponing it.
but recently i surfed the net for qualities required in a wi-fi router for home usage (which was very-2 helpful) and zeroed on this product.
but i was concerned most about coverage area at our's home (as it is two n half storey with a lots of walls), but that is no more there, and I am very happy that i bought this product.
pros-
1. easy to install (please have your user id and password if u are a dsl user)
2. EXCELLENT n SEAMLESS coverage.
3. connect upto 5 devices.
4. high transfer rate.
5. light weight
cons- none yet
conclusion- go for it without worrying",5
"Best product in this price rangle, treble is good, and bass is ok.",5
Nice quality good delivery service i can like all ways Amazon because India's no 1 delevery service,5
"This version of Mi Band has definitely outclassed other versions with its features, ease of use. The app is also well equipped to serve all the required purpose. Though the sleep tracking part is not completely accurate, but definitely at this price range, this device is worth for money",5

Very good mobile in this price range,5

Good overall response across mid and high frequencies...with an emphasis on bass. Can turn off equalizers and still get good quality output. Worth the money.,5
Don't doubt it. Best as backup power to wifi router during power cuts. Hassle free. Quick installation. 3-4hrs based on your wifi rig. 12V 1.4A gave backup for 4 hrs after power cut. 12V 2A may give 3-4 hrs.,5

"Just got it delivered. Writing the review earlier as you have to review it to claim for warranty.
Got a gaana plus subscription for 3 months.
These were additional info u need to know now, let's talk about headphones:-
Pros:-👍🏻
1)The packing was amazing looked like u have really ordered something premium(amazon packing was also gud but here I'm talking about real product box) Everything is just brand new😉
2)Sound quality is just awesome. No complaints( The volume also depends on the mobile device with which it is paired, it was a bit louder with my Samsung galaxy a50 than my brothers Motorola)
3)Base is balanced and not annoying, Just as required.
4)Earcups are super soft, haven't used it for longer but I'm expecting less pain.
5)My ears are not that big so it kind of fully covers my ears givin overear feeling(which u r not gonna get anywhere else at this price)
6)The lights also look premium, doesn't give a cheap look and is an eye catcher.
7)Just a one click connect bluetooth pairing, really feels awesome.
8)The range is pretty good, although mentioned 10m but when I got to another floor the voice started to break at nearly 7m but then the floor wall was also in between so in an open area u can expect bigger range.
9) Can't tell much about battery as I haven't tested.
Cons:-
1)when content it is always showing 80 percent charged even after 30 min usage so I think it doesn't provide accurate info about charging status.
2)When u try to fold or unfold, it makes an annoying sound like ""khaatt"". I find it really annoying as for the first time I thought as if something broke.
3)one of the side buttons unfinished( has rough edges although not visible until looked on)
4)The bending edges are also a bit unfinished(not noticable until u try to find a flaw intentionally😅)

Conclusion:-
Just go for it. The cons are not worth considering because they common and u would get them with any other headphones. Just to tell u I have intentionally tried to find flaws and told u what I felt.",5
One word that describes it the best,5
Good product for sleep tracking and workouts,5

Overall, these are good earphones, I can recommend these Earphones to anyone.",5

I'm not a huge music/audio fanatic so my review may not be very weighted. This does the job, hasn't stopped working so far, mic works great, the sound quality and the bass are quite good. I would recommend.",5

"Printer Is Good But My Experience It Is Not For Heavy Use If You Use It Heavy,Large Documents Print Than It Is Surely Loose Your Pocket For Buying Ink Cartridges!!!..It Is Only For Home And Occasional use..
I Am Buying It During Amazon Great India Sale Very Discounted Rate So It Is Awesome Deal For Me.Received New Hp Seal Pack.
Pros:-
1.Wi-Fi Range:-
Its Cover My 2Bedroom and Hall Successfully But Little Bit Take Time To Connect My Wi-fi Dongle(My Desktop)
2.Automatic Updates:-
Printer Is Automatic Update When It's Connect To My Wi-Fi Router
A Little Bit Difficult Process To Add To Printer On Wi-fi Router And My Desktop ..After Some Try I am Successfully Connected To Printer With My Wi-Fi Router.
Cartiges
Both cartiges is original color print is good if you print branded photo color paper but
I am not understand why my black color cartiges vaporize automaticaly and create light black spot on my new printer many places.
Anyways this printer is good for light use and home use like personal photo print,personal printout,importent document to scan etc.",5

"Just now I received the earphones; on comparing the earlier earphones, got from celebrated manufacturers
of known mobiles, the sound both bass and treble is outstanding. Added to that, you get extra pairs of earbuds

ears open, to listen to a nicer music which will take you to your own music world, at an affordable cost!",5
Worth for every penny. I only spent 350 INR for this earphone. Still this satosfying me. No problems wit the sound. As I already commemted my another boat earphone this is one of my favorite,5

Awesome.cable is 👍good but charging pin very bad.,5
Quality is not low when compared to other MI phones or MI Poco phones. Camera features and quality has to be made better,5
Quite impressed with the earphone and the warranty of 1 year is fairly good reason to buy..the output of earphone is such that since I have bought this I haven't increased volume on my phone beyand half-way mark..can go for it without a second thought,5
The speed test talks for itself. Such a superstar product!,5
Useful for money,5

"got this for our worker and uts a pretty petite phone for todays standards but good quality perfect for normal phone usage. Just has one camera of decent quality on either side. Screen seems a bit small though as its 20:9 but screen quality is good.

The charger is micro usb but not the removable usb cable type but a fixed cable and gets heated a bit.
Over all great alternative to chineese entry level phones which finally brands like samsung are bringing with reasonable specs",5

I was waiting for this color display since last 4months.. finally i got this on Great Indian Sale for Rs.2000 with sbi offer. 101% satisfied. Very accurate performance in all level. Thanks for the music control feature and unlimited watch face. Evan google map also we can load it by using additional app..,5
Experience.Good luck to have,5
"Great mobile with great camera and screen quality. We do not use it for gaming but the functionalities like calling, youtube & WhatsApp are being used heavily. all functiosn work seamlessly awesome. Battery life and camera are the stand out feature of this phone. We have been using it for a month now.",5
At first when i used them i wasn't very sure that these are pretty good but when i used other earphones like Philips and even headphones I was irritated by its output vocals weren't that clear and that was the time when i realised the sheer quality of these.😉,5
"Excellent product in this price range. I looked for multiple options and I am not guilty to choose this one. Worth buying.

Amazon's superfast delivery in 1 day, made it super awesome.",5
Very good quality.,5
awesome product,5
Camera quality is best but item missing my package,5
"The colour accuracy is really great. Looks great with narrow bezzles. On paper, the brightness might be just 220 nits (theoretically lesser than its competitors). But upon using it, i found the brightness to be just perfect in a well lit room too.
Good for professionals (CAD, 3D or photoshop work) as it boasts of 103 percent sRGB. (I didn't need a monitor for gaming which was above 60hz so this was just perfect for my use case)
The only downside is that the plug/power cord provided within the box has a chinese plug head which means some of you would need a connector/spike guard to power it on. I didn't have that problem as my switch board has modular switches so it easily plugs in.
The backlight bleed is negligible. Nothing to worry about there.
Generally you get deep blacks with led displays and not ips displays. But believe me, while using this ips monitor, you won't feel anything odd. For it's price, it is offering much more than what you pay for.
The height isn't adjustable but frankly, thats not something you do on a day to day basis. It has tilt option though. This 24 inch monitor has a standard height for itself which is perfect in terms of ergonomics.
Overall i am totally satisfied with the purchase.",5
"This device is just loyal ,
A must go product, if you have price constraints and are not going for dual band router which are a bit pricey
The network is most reliable among all the router I have used
Its speed is enough and competes with most of the 2.4G routers
The software is feature rich and you can create a guest network in which you can limit the speed ,this feature I found most useful for other people",5
Very nice product..was delivered properly..great utility..but needs time to install software for the first time..,5

 Things I dislike most are

The product is very useful and handy. The colour white gets dirty very quickly otherwise it has awesome range. It works fine even when the door is closed. Delivery was done as per schedule.,5
"Previously I was using a Belking Router which was really bad with 100Mbps connection. So I bought this one. MU/MIMO is good. I use my FireTV, Xbox, iPad & Phone simultaneously and it manages the speed well.
Setup was easy through the app.
It covers upto 2 walls with minimal signal loss.
Currently using in a 1200sqft home and can access from my apartment's front gate which is around 4 walls and at least 10 meters away, though signal is only 1/2 bars and with 100Mbps connection it gives around 30-40Mbps from that range.
Overall good experience till now.",5

I m feeling survey almost after 8 months for this product. Till now code is working excellent way..,5
Bluetooth version is 4.2 had problem connecting to high end version bluetooth 5.0 TVs. The connection took long time and was frustrating. If you buy for laptops or TVs get other headphones which has version 5.0,5
Very nice and user friendly watch,5
Its super printer.....value for money....but sometimes it doesn't print and gives out empty paper...we can adjust it.....and if u do not press the stop button it will create many copies of the same design or sentences u want to print ....but it is a very good printer in very low cost.....,5
Best at cheap price. Same mode will be charged ₹1199 in Croma and ₹1299 in Reliance Digital,5

"It's full value for the money. I purchased it at Rs. 21,500. It is far better than mobile cameras and tiny digital cameras. There is a vast difference in pics.",5
Its good but tracking is average,5
"Pretty good for this price range. The sound is crisp and clear, you could hear the tones that you otherwise won't in cheap headphones/earphones. The bass is very good, has all the highs and lows and they don't fade into singularity.",5
Good watch under 3000,5
"Very Good ,Value for Money Product.",5
"It's a very good router worth buying it just has a bit heating issuses according to the environment it's kept in. Looks good compat and stylish.
Gave 192 mbps download and 240 upload speed on my mobile on 5.0 hz mode, the speed depends on ur plan I have a plann of 200 Mbps.
The ping was good to 22 ms it's perfect for daily usage enough ethernet ports for a normal user and its a very high quality budget router for me.
It also came with different connectors for adapter.",5
Brilliant phone in this budget segment with all advanced specifications. Good camera the design is marvellous although the camera bump is a minor problem but it's not that relevant. Moreover a great battery life lasts a full day.,5

But camera is poor",5
"Best battery, decent camera, overall ultimate budget phone out of the box........
Really #Damdaar phone",5
"This tracker is 95% accurate on all modes, as any other tracker there is few extra steps counted. Battery life is not going to be 7 or 14 days with all features ON and if you are going to workout for long hours a day. It's like 3-4 days with all features on and with basic features and manual heart rate it can easily go with 7 days, the biggest feature I liked is we can shut down the watch completely when not using and smart mode which automatically detect our hands and if we are not wearing it will turn off most features include always on display.Got a firmware update yesterday with big fix and performance improvement and this smartwatch is very new just less than a month release, just give them time and through firmware update most of the bugs and battery backup will improve gradually.",5
"Nice product and i like the features like sleep tracking, mobile app & touch screen. Awesome product, thanks for beautiful smart watch..i'll give you 5 out 5 rating on this product.",5
Super value mobile,5
Thanks for amazan,5
"Mic is best in segment and according to sound it was little low as compared to 50 mm drivers.Just go for it don't see youtube videos bcoz they wear costly headphone so how they will like budget headphones.

Any how amazing headphones although not suitable for small head.minimum 9cm length of head should be there.",5

"I have upgraded from mi band 2 to mi band 4 and i have to admit that this band is awesome.
Display is bright enough in direct sunlight
Battery is expected to give 20 days of backup.
Rest all the features are functioning properly and build quality of both strap and band have improved significantly from mi band 2 and 3.
The main reason i bought this band is for its display and the caller id feature, as i receive calls mostly while travelling.
Weather updates are also accurate.
Thanks xiaomi for this awesome product.
You can also use custom watchfaces but remember few custom watch faces might effect battery backup.",5
Everything is a good,5

"No need to waste one's money on expensive headphones unless you need it for a super specialized reason. These are wonderful earphones with good design, excellent sound quality and class A packaging (includes a transparent bag to securely keep the earphones as well). For once, this is truly a case of paying for the ""brand-name"" only if you are purchasing any other when these are available. I want to thank and encourage such companies which are demonstrating that good stuff can be made available to people at large without exorbitant pricing.",5
This is a good product this budget,5
