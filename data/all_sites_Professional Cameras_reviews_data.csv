"Good product in this price..This is a good and a small tripod only for smartphones. Tripod and a mount. When legs fully opened, it is around 7 inch. When closed it is around 5 inch. Legs have lock options so even if by mistake, it won't loose or fall. But centre part has no big support. Still it is great for mobile",4

Nice............Nice Excellent,5
1st time received with out memory card and pouch. Replaced it but next time received same. Now I want to completely return it because in q&a section answered that 32gb memory card and pouch free.,1
"I love it. Haven't had any issues with it yet. Pictures and videos are clear and sharp. Unlike some of the reviews I've seen on YouTube for the G7, stabilization is good and light gathering abilities of the kit lens not so bad. I'm using it for professional documentary film making and so far, I've had no complaints yet.",5
I'm quite happy with this purchase. The price has now been pitched at an affordable level. Real value for money.,5
"Pros - Nice product from every aspects.
Cons - Should come with camera bag and memory card.",5
"See the condition of package. The pictures will speak a lot. We had paid for the new camera not for a used or refurbished one. There was no user manual or related documents inside the box.

Update - next day we received replacement which looks new with all documents.",1
"NO WORDS TO EXPRESS....ABSOLUTELY WORTH FOR A SINGLE PENNY...I LOVE IT...GRAET CAMARA WITH SUPERB FEATURES.
THIS IS CAMARA IS PREDOMINANTLY FOR BEGINNERS LIKE YOUTUBE VLOGERS AND SO ON.
EASY TO CARRY AND STYLE ENOUGH.
GO FOR IT.
THANKS.",5
"This is my first camera. I ordered this because of I am creating content for YouTube and I need 4k camera in low budget.

So this camera comes with huge features in it.

Pros-
1. Very lightweight
2. 4k support
3. Wifi support
4. Tilted touch screen

Cons-
1. Battery life is about 1.5 hour in video
2. Image quality is ok with its kit lens as this camera have 16mp only",5
"I was about to purchase a Nikon DSLR but an influential devil told me to go for the g7 for its 4k video abilities. I'm glad I did. Kudos to the seller n amazon! It's power pack...
Need more time to dive deeper. Cheers!",5
"This is a great camera. It's a small form factor and I absolutely love how light it is and the pictures it takes just out of the box are amazing. However, the USB data cable that comes with it is Panasonic proprietary cable. Understandably this camera came out in 2015 so back then USB-C wasn't as common... so we're stuck with this weird cable that if you lose, the likelihood of easily finding another is so less. I lost mine and I am stuck unable to transfer pictures to my laptop from this... the SD card reader in my laptop is busted and until I buy a new (USB) one of those, I can't transfer pictures. Am I dumb? Yes. But is this camera also dumb? Totally.",4
"Actually this camera is best in competeting and also in solo wise😄😄,,especially picture quALLITY is damn great ,untill you know how to use the aperture and ISO OR ELSE many as mentioned it as mobile camera because they don't know how to take the pi that's the exact answer to them,overall it's really a great and damn awesome mirrorless camera and also if it's paired with 45-150mm lens you will get a cine feel pics",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The first photos that you are seeing are taken with the camera and with 14-42mm kit lens.......
This camera is definitely a very good camera for beginners....
This camera also performs good in low light even with kit lens
You need to bump up iso to 6400
A little noise can come
But that's not a big issue as u can fix that in post processing or in editing software
Also the battery backup is pretty good
As it last around a day with full charge and it takes 3hrs to charge

To get the most out of this camera
Use the following settings
Back dial- for exposure
Shutter dial- for respective control in the mode(like aperture in A or shutter in S)

Then use F1 button for auto focus
As it can come handy while using manual focus

Use F3 for digital zoom

And you can use the HYDN mode in bright sunlight as it has wider dynamic range and in some cases better skin tones (sometimes the skintones look worse)

I mostly use A for photography
And A in manual movie mode also,
Some photos of my settings are also attached.....",5
"Better for Video Shooting, Budgetwise better 4K Camera.

If you choose photoshoot, go to Canon & Nikon",4
"Great Product.If anybody unable to register warranty online please enter dealer name as
Appario Retail Private Limited instead of Appario Retail Private Ltd then it will be shown in drop down menu.Then we will be able to register without any issues.I mailed this regarding Panasonic and Amazon and finally got a call from Panasonic executive and was able to register.Hope this will help all who are looking to purchase this great camera.",5
Picture quality is worst waste Mony😞 I will purchase this product January 02-01-2020 but I am not satisfied so I will be returned this product. But no accept my return request in Amazon costumer service worst,1
Cool product.. best value for money...,5
"The product is really good for beginners. i don't have any experience in photography. This is my 1st digital camera so that I really satisfied with this camera. The picture quality and the pixels are really great. Thanks you Panasonic for making the good experiences.

For the last one year I used this product till now no bad remarks. Every time I am wondering about the picture quality and the dynamic range when we look at the shoots :-)",5
"This is my review after 3 months.. its an awesome piece of gold.. has 4k.. good clarity, i am using this to shoot my youtube channel. Awome clarity, light weight easy to use.. need to set some manual picture grade.. only drawback is it doent have 120fps shooting.. remaining all superb. Must buy",5
"camera is fantastic in build quality and features. just buy one extra lens of 45-150mm if you need, thats it... you can rock !!!
drawback is the app. Image app, Panasonic pls consider, this spoils your product quality, very often disconnection and the UI of the app also boring, totally app is lazy. all we need is the app like DJI.",5
Everything is best at this Price n Value for Money But the Seller is not mentioning the Serial Number on the Invoice which is Critical n Important for warranty.. I spl to Amazon so they asked me to wait for 4 days.. Otherwise I will return this product without warranty.,5
Not met my expectations. Average Camera. No camera bag and memory card with the Package and You have to spend at least 2000 rupees to buy memory card and Camera bag. Auto Focus not works as mentioned. Average Quality. Not happy with the product.,1
"I have given 3 stars bcoz of the seller and amazon delivery. The seller sent the camera with its seal open twice which was very frustrating. But I didn’t return it second time bcoz the camera was fine. This camera has some nice features, you can use it for photography and videos both. Good camera for beginners.",3
"Poor quality pics and videos. We'll be getting better pics and videos by using some popular mobile handsets priced below 25k. Buying this camera, I lost my money.",2
"A great camera for filmmaking, I would not suggest this camera if you're into vlogging and all...there's a problem with autofocus its not that good...but yeah for filmmaking it's totally worth it because you don't need autofocus...manual focus is all what you need..",5
"This is possibly one of the best camera's out there if you are starting out with filmmaking. It is not preferred for Photography though, but for videography is works excellently. It has all the features you need to start off.",5
Yes. This mirrorless digital camera is loaded with almost all features which any professional level camera can have. For hobbits it's a complete course to study all features.At this price and features no other brand camera is available at present. Videography and portraits quality is beyond imagination.,5
"Autofocus is average but picture quality and video quality is best, best for creators",5
"Still one of the best cameras out there in the market both for beginners and professional users, has everything you need and is very handy too. The Lumix G7 from my side is straight up amazing. Great product to purchase!",5
"This camera is very awesome and first time I use a camera and this is that camera from Amazon orderedduring great Indian festival offer, received the package in 4 days. Awesome clairty I was fabulous seeing this and more options are there, need to check every option. But sad thing is didn't get a pouch and memory card, need to buy externally",5
"It's an excellent camera for beginners like me. The camera design is stunning with good grip. Image quality is excellent.
The only con is they should have provided a SD card and HDMI cable with it.",4
"This camera like a mobile camera.
Picture quality not good.mobile camera photography is better than lumix g7.lens not properly work.
Really waste of money don't buy..canon and Nikon is best.",1

"I bought this for Rs.47,000/- next month they made it Rs.35,000. WTH ??? Companies shouldnt just drop price so drastically that it ruins our investment. There should be a gradual decrease.

PLz note my following review is entirely based on video on this camera as i didnt buy it for stills. Only a fool would buy this for stills as for the same price you can get an awesome Canon/Nikon DSLR which will have a much larger sensor giving you lovely shallow DOF and color reproduction.

Anyway, this camera gives you 4K quality that can almost look like a Redmi phone's 4K recording. Horrible green tinged or bluish tinged footage. So bad is its inherent white balance and color temp handling. No amount of tweaking will get you out. Panasonic cant beat Canons color science and natural color that you get from Canon DSLRs. Dont trust all the YouTube videos you see etc. They have shot those in scenes where the bluish tinge adds to the appeal. But show me good skin tone shots with this camera. Very rare to see. Unless you invest in a very costly lens maybe.

Also in a DSLR, lets say you want to have a certain wide angle lens, say that lens for your DSLR costs you X amount. For the same effect (with no shallow DOF bec of its miniature sensor in the G7) and angle of view in the G7 the lens will cost 3 times as much.

Im planning to shoot myself for buying this utter waste of a camera. Only after buying it did i realize that the color tinge etc wont accomodate for all types of shots. Whereas in a DSLR you can do cool temp shots and lovely warm shots. The amount of noise in the video (color & luma noise dots on the video for laymen to understand) even in average and well lit rooms will drive you crazy. Especially with yellow pale walls and browns. The final will be murky and with rough noise in it.

How do i know all this. 9 years of experience in Photography & Videography. Trust me or not, dont ever buy this. You can go for a full frame or APSC size mirrorless camera instead from makers like Sony/Canon/Nikon etc.

Thanks for reading this. And wish you all a sensible purchase.",1
Panasonic G7 has a veru good built quality and feel solid in the hand. It has 4K video capture capability while being very good for still photography.,5
Value for money. But autofocus can be better.,5
"Touch display helps alot, and u have in build guide. Lense is also enough for normal photography , There is no additional attachment or safety bag in the pack, not even a memory card. That's a really big mood kill. Because as soon as you hold the camera for the first time you want to click but you can't because at first you have to go out and buy a memory card for it. In this price the product is superb. But 1 more thing Amazon charge you for gift wrap and don't deliver in gift wrap.",4
A very good camera for the price. light weight and very comfortable to hold. Display screen is good but the viewfinder screen is even better . Still digging through the functions even though the automatic mode does most of the heavy work.,5
good quality image and performance. Very much happy,5
Price very high..If it is 31000 or 32000 it wood be purchasable.... try it Thank you.best of luck guys bye,4
Nice one and a prompt delivery from Amazon.The picture quality was good.I gifted to my son.He was soo happy with this Mirrorless Camera,5
Value for money,5
This is the perfect camera for videographers,5
"I have bought it EOS80D, when I tried to register it with Canon EDGE, It is astonishing to see the message "" your serial number is already registered"" etc. That means what I received is not new! or re-furbished one! what is this?",2
Awesome camera,5
"I bought this camera in September 2016 and been using it for more than a year. Following are some useful points for those who are really interested in photography:

Pros:
1. Excellent battery life
2. Super fast focusing
3. Weather-sealed body gives you confidence to shoot during rains and wet conditions.
4. Great choice of lenses(any Canon camera would have this advantage)
5. Excellent from-camera JPEG images(which most Nikon users feel is a disadvantage for them and often prefer post-processing)
6. Good shutter speed
7. Amazing live-view for shooting and focusing( This is where it does better than Nikon cameras. Video mode has Dual-pixel CMOS technology for focusing. So gives you cinematic effect)
8. Touch-screen gives you better control during focusing if you are using Live-view(for both stills and videos) and also helps you to navigate through menus and images faster and review the images in a faster way
9. Kit lens has good zoom range of 18-135 mm (which most of the other same priced also provide)
10. Inclusion of time-lapse feature is boon for many enthusiasts and travel photographers
11. Full articulated screen has helped me many times during hand-held shots of macros, landscapes and portraits.

Cons:
1. Poor low-light performance compared to other same priced DSLRs
2. Kit lens zoom range is good but unlike other Canon cameras you don't get kit lens with zoom upto 250mm. This is a disadvantage for wildlife/bird photographers.
3. Dynamic range is poor. Lots of details lost when shooting images with bright highlights and dark shadows.Although camera has in-build HDR mode, the quality and sharpness of the image is very poor. My Nikon 5500 performs much better. It has good Dxo Mark rating for HDR
4. Image quality detirorates rapidly after ISO2500. This is where Nikon D5500 performs much better.
5. RAW Image quality is poor compared to my Nikon D5500 and lesser details

1. For first time DSLR buyers:
-Well I feel this is too expensive buy for first-time buyers. Most of the first time buyers often end up giving their interest in photography and their cameras soon end up in OLX or Quickr with hardly being used. So I suggest buying less expensive DSLRs or buying Nikon cameras if you dont need touch-screen and twivel-screen or don't shoot live-view.

2. For those who are upgrading:
There are two categories here. Upgrading since they already Canon Lens and those upgrading from beginner to enthusiasts without any preference of brand. For those upgrading from Canon and if you already have good canon lenses, this is the right option. For those who don't mind the brand, I would suggest Nikon D7200 but again if you are doing lot of video and using screen for shooting and want flexibility to review images like the way you do with your smartphones, this is good option",3
"I was using Canon 60D before this and just got this 7/8 days back, this has some good features than the earlier model.24.2Mp, Touch screen LCD panel, Wi-Fi connectivity and with the EOS utility one can take photoshoot from the camera with our mobile, very useful. And picture quality as always good in Canon DSLR, I got this in lightening deal, so enjoying :)",5
"In August 2020 ordered an iPhone from Amazon through Appario retail. Seller cancelled the order unilaterally as they did not want to honour the offer committed. I decided not to buy anything costly from amazon and Appario Retail. In fact I cancelled my prime membership too.
Made a mistake of buying Canon EOS 80D from Amazon again by mistake unknowingly from same seller Appario Retail. Order made on sunday 7th march and item received next day without memory card 16GB. I called amazon service and they said items will be replaced. Second time also item was received that again without memory card and this time customer service unilaterally cancels order and issues refund that too only by next Saturday.
I had applied for LTC cash as per Govt Of India guidelines and submitted bill for same. Now I have to cancel the same and I do not have the time do another purchase. I demand that sufficient compensation given to teh financial loss I am incurring because of not able to claim LTC cash of about Rs 32000 just because this order is cancelled.",1
Good for quick focus. Good picture not that much sharp comparing to prime lens. Over all very sturdy built hefty weight. But I am in doubt since the battery was fully exausted when i insert in it for the first time. I was waiting for two more hours to have the camera function. The moment i turn ON the camera it display sensor cleaning. But the battery seems like fake one. The side of USB ports cover was not fully closed its slightly open. I tried to register it but it seems it was already registered.,5
"Its a Woooww.. Wonderful product.. I bought with a great offer. Its actual price is 90000 with 18-55 kit lens
I got it for 67,500. Its original and i received in canon sealed box. and i also checked by registering online. worth for the money this is the best and lowest priced model in semi professional camera.",5
One of the best camera I have ever handled. High quality DSLR at cheaper price. The kit lens 18-135 mm USM is a noise free lens and you can do everything with f3.5 -5.6 .,5
It was a delight to order and get the product in 7 hours. I was surprised by everything. Product was packed good and there was no issue whatsoever at all. This is one of the best camera for semi pro photographers and i had my eye on this for a long time and finally its in my hands.,5
"Still the best in 2020 at this price range. Solid build and great image quality especially in low light... Compatible with various lenses available in the market :)

Faster shutter speed, 18-135mm USM lens performs great on 80D. And the battery is very good - supports to shoot as much as possible (500+ shots) on a long day!

Thanks to Amazon and seller Appario for good packaging and shipping genuine products. Keep it up!",5
"Auto focus is good but not the best i would say.
Canon 80d is not for the beginners, and i don't recommend this model for beginners. It's a good mid end camera for professionals. Picture quality is also good enough but not the best compared to High end models. But the thing is no other model cameras or other brand which is similar to this price doesn't get the features as much as 80d. 80d is loaded with enough features and it's user friendly. It's also best in handling.",5
"DONT THINK TWICE just go for it, Awesome product from canon good packaging and on time delivery from amazon, very pleased from the purchase",5
"Best camera for all purpose
Bestest focussing
Bestest camera controls
Bestest hand held for all tele lenses
Very good night photography

"Pros:

Good range of ISO

Cons:
Bit heavy

Go for 18 mm to 135 mm. got it for 73k which is good price.",5
It is way beyond my expectations. It works amazing and very handy. Good for low light photography too. I specially liked its touch screen.,5
"A great crop sensor semi professional camera. When used with right lens it gives a great picture quality. I use Canon 85mm and 50mm USM lens, focusing is great and picture quality is awesome.",3
I taken camera 2months only use only lens was defective Don't buy the camera in Amazon why because defects in lens nd body I taken I facing the problem also then not solve the service center also giving the replacements camera's to sell the customer that's y problem was creating,1
Fantastic camera. I leave my 5d MkIII home now when I travel for pleasure. It is light and the AF is fantastic. Pity no Cinestyle or Magic lantern as of now.,5
Keep Checking the Price. Very Dynamic in Price Change. Otherwise it is a good product,5
Picture quality is very good,5
When i register the product it shows already registered,4
"Price is little bit high

He cost me alot

But camera is awsome only seller annoyed .

I highly recommend you all not to buy from the seller i bought..",1
First i was reluctant to buy this but after I received it was happy to get the right product and from the brand.,5

Good video camera too.
18-135mm + 50mm makes it a perfect combo.",5
"My 2nd dslr, I had Nikon shifted to canon. Great camera. Using it for taking products in my furniture shop.",5
if you are beginning it might be overkill to buy this but it all depends on you and your budget by the best you can afford its a really good camera but its better to look it up on youtube and go to a camera store to see for yourself,5
"It's a very good camera for entry to enthusiast.
As it can fit a very wide range of lenses.
Super performance",5
Nice Product and value for Money,5
Delivery and service is very good. Product is genuine and verified by registering at canon website,5

i Love this product,5
"It's a good semi-professional DSLR for photography and most importantly for shooting great quality videos. Canon's Dual Pixel AF is truly awesome. I am really astonished by the performance of 18-135 mm kit lens. It's quiet and capable of capturing sharp and beautiful photos out of the box. This product got delivered to me within couple of days. Packaging could have been better though for an expensive product like this. Overall, a great buy.",4
,5
Built quality great seems to be a good fit for regular handeling. Try to go for 18-135 kit only as it serves as multipurpose for a beginner. But try at the canon store you may get better price as when I went to pick prime lens I found out they had better offer. Same with sigma lens and canon connect station don't buy in Amazon price is high.,5
love this cam.. brought it for Video recording and the focusing system is just amazing... 100% shooting all the videos on this rather than on 5D Mark 3. for photos pushed the ISO till 2000 usable images.. at 1600 very little noise... very happy.. didnt expect it to be so good...on time and well packaged delivery along with all the warranties!,5
"Good Camera guys!! Amezon is cheapest compare to canon dealers,i recieved it early .....
its simply AWESOME",5
"I didn't leave feedback instantly after receiving the product but was busy testing the camera. After using for around 1/2 week, I definitely would like to say this is one of the best purchase from Amazon so far. I love this camera. The product quality is great and I love using it.",5
"I ordered this camera with lots of hope and trust on canon but after using this camera for 6 months , i am highly disappointed.
I am facing many problems.
and the price is also high i bought for Rs. 91,999/- as compared to other shops its too expensive.",1
this is an excellent camera for this price.,5
Superb Camera with amazing functions...Thanks Amazon....as always for an AMAZONing deal...,5
Awesome product thanx amazon for a good offer.,5
"Got this product a year ago. Everything good but there is a defect in up arrow button, it is not working properly.",3
Very good results with canon 'L' series lens. Kit lens not having sharp pictures. Better to buy body and 50mm prime for starting photography. Got best price from amazone.,5
"Now i facing so Many problems

Very careless,1
Excellent cam.. Love it! was using 60D earlier which was also an excellent camera. But canon has really stepped up with dynamic range in this cam. To get the best results with dynamic range shoot at iso 100. ISO performance is only little better than 60D but there is improvement.,5
Must buy camera for beginning enthusiasts. But don't get 18-135 bundle. Buy body only and get a good lens with it.,5
Great Camera. Enjoying the output.Amazon great service provider.,5
Just buy it. Don't think too much.,5
Best camera from canon .. love to use its auto-focus system,5
Awesome product. Thanks Amazon for cheapest price.,5
"Probably the best ever cam for beginners and pros 😊😊
My best companion!!
I am a beginner and it's so fun to learn with it!!",5
"This review is after a year of usage under different conditions. The new processor is great , the AF system is a dream to use specially for video and live view AF tracking for subject works almost all the time when u are taking sports photograph. I upgraded from 600D and after a lot of research between the full frame 6D and this, I chose this over the full frame mainly due to the pretty old AF system of the 6D. I am happy with my choice so far. The 24 Mp sensor will allow crops to look better and in my case, I am managing bird photography with a 70-300mm lens on this body rather than going for a 100-400L. The dynamic range is high and I have been able to extract light in very dark shots in post processing. The frame rate is also quite decent and should be good enough for sports photography. It can give the much more expensive 7dMk2 a run for the money :-) The only issue I find with this camera is the Auto ISO many times assumes higher ISO settings like a ISO 1600 and overexposes the photo. I have to use exposure bracketing or manual exposure setting to avoid this. The other irritant is that i can not change the Autofocus system with a single button when I am taking a photo like i could do in 600 d by turning the wheel behind the shutter button. There are of course dedicated the buttons for AF system but it is a bit of a hassle to look out of the viewfinder , change AF and recompose shots again. i hope to find a solution to this through more practice or setting change.There are some niggles with the Wifi connection too . It is not very smooth and most of the times does not connect automatically. Would have given it a well deserved 5 stars but for these small issues.",4
Superb camera but priced high at amazon. Excellent for photography and video making in daylight but low light videography is bit of a challenge with this camera. Anyways good camera for a newbie to start off.,4
What i can say about this. It has changed my Life and i'm loving it.,4
I am extremely satisfied with my purchase because this camera is capable of capturing amazing videos and pictures.,5
"This has been my first DSLR and I am pretty much comfortable with it. I have bought it for shooting videos primarily and it's quite satisfactory in that. Though the camera is quite bulky & weighs 750 gms+, but since I am using a tripod, hence not a problem for me. But for those who wish to take it for out of home use, must consider its bulkiness.",5
"Awesome camera.I have been using this for 3 weeks with lens 18-135 kit lens .
Though its a good zoom lens 18- 135 , it is not a speed lens ( f3.5 - f 5.6 ) , so less depth of field
Only thing to get shallow depth of field on this lens is to put at 135 mm and shoot at a distance .
Normally for portraits , the sweet spot would be between 50 - 85 mm .
On this range the kit lens has an fstop min 4.5 which is pretty bad.
This is an okay lens which will work for different purposes.
For portraits and lowlights I recommend 50mm 1.8 STM lens. It gives good shallow DOF and nyc bokeh.
Kindly use perfect cleaning kit - like the zeiss .",5
"This is my first camera, so I am not an expert. But I just compared the photos taken in my camera with others and found that this piece is so amazing. Though I am a newbie, there was no tricks to be done to take stunning images. Worth spending for this. The auto focus works in a lighting speed in a perfect way. At least for me this was very useful. The processing delay for HDR is bit high. In manual mode the settings changes works just perfect; a newbie like me can take photos without struggling much.",5
"It's a good camera. Nice upgrade from entry level to mid range photography.. I particularly liked the 18-135 mm nano usm lens.. Fast and silent auto focus. I upgraded from samsung mirror less nx 300 to this one so i find this one quite heavy compared to my mirrorless.. But i was blown away by the photos it captures..
Only downside is when i tried to register my product online it says already registered in back date of 3 months.. If seller resolves this issue then i give 5 stars..",4
Best dslr under rs 1 lakh . It has 2 option one with 55mm lens and other with 155mm lens. 300mm zoom lens also available at rs 30000 almost. Great build. Picture quality is awesome and one more nice feature is that the screen is ejectible with 360 degree rotation.,5
"Im in love with this camera zoom quality is superb i can see alien talking to each other in another galaxy ... I dont need to go to temples i can see gods also space centre should buy this camera instead of wasting money on telescope...and i can also see the bacteria , microorganisms on my hand. All over camera is god level",5
Fast delivery nd get orginal product. Bt price is little high. We get it on shops for 71K and 76K for Body with 18-135Mm lense,4
"I just bought the camera and used it for 3 full days and clicked like a maniac, trigger happy actually. The camera has a huge amount of features. You will discover at least 2 new features every day you use it. The manual is a big one nearly 300 pages and it is just the Basic Manual. Canon has given a link where you can download the extended advanced manual. Also there is a link to learn the basic operations of the camera.
So lets gets started with the review.
FIT and FINISH
The best part is that the Camera Body is made in Japan and the lens is made in Taiwan. So the quality of the fit and finish is impeccable. Thank God it is not made in the Cheap-Underbelly-of-the-manufacturing-industry-of-the-world. It has a well balanced weight and since I have the 18-135mm lens, it is just a tad more heavy than if you have the 18-55mm lens kit. The keys and buttons have very good tactile feedback and all controls are within reach. Touch screen is very good and you can control the camera including taking pictures / movie, changing settings etc. all via the touch screen. The strap provided is also of a very good quality. Even the lens covers are either made in Japan or Taiwan, not CH**A.
LENS and Photography
The lens is really good. View both via the view finder and the LCD is great. View finder has 100% coverage and shows many important settings like shutter speed, aperture, focus points, etc. Auto focus is the best part of the camera. It is super fast. LCD display is very clear and is visible in sunlight too. Focus pulling is simply awesome. You will love it.
MODES
Has many modes which can be selected by the normal circular button. It has a push lock to prevent unintentional changes in settings. Also has a separate lock which can be assigned to a particular setting wheel. When the lock is active, even turning the wheel will not change the setting. The scene modes are really good. You can shoot in the low light, different colour background, fast moving objects which need continuous focus. The control over shutter speed is awesome (from 1/8000 to 30 sec). You even can control the Shutter / Mirror noise. There is a mode where the noise is suppressed! ISO Range is high, aperture control is also good. Each mode change actually shows some visible change in the output. So the features actually work and are not for name sake.
LENS Mount
Has a variety of lens options available. Just visit AMAZON and CANON sites to explore. See YOUTUBE videos where a lot of topics are there for the best lenses to be used with Canon 80D. I will not mention my choice here, since the review is only for the camera.
OTHERS
For the more tech geeks, it has NFC and Wi Fi compatibility which allows data transfer among various devices. Please explore this area as infinite possibilities exist here.
I can keep writing, but final verdict --- If you are interested in photography, you like taking different kinds of pictures, you travel often and you are looking for a camera that does not cost the world, still has the best professional quality output and has a decent build, then you cannot have a better camera than this one. Go for it as Canon deserves KUDOS for bringing out this much needed mid segment camera.",5
"Loving the camera for all its features. The sensor on this model is really good for low light photography as the noise levels are pretty low with a 50mm 1.4 sigma lens clubbed with it. The 45 point tracking comes very handy while shooting out in the open, especially since I'm into bird watching and photography. The kit lens is decent and is more so for day to day shots, but definitely purchase the 55-250mm as another lens in your kit.",5
"I selected the 80D to replace my venerable 50D which, although still being able to cut it with today's DSLRs, is a tad old now. I'll start with the only negative thing about this camera, which is the build quality - the 50D was full magnesium alloy, however this feels a bit plasticky, despite having a partial metal chassis. This trend towards lighter, less durable bodies was first seen at this level in the 60D, but at least the 80D betters its recent predecessors by having some degree weather sealing. This backward step in build quality stops me from awarding what would otherwise be the full five stars.

Onto the positives, then, of which there are plenty. The new 24mp sensor (which IS NOT the same as in the 750/760D) produces good detail and dynamic range, and the anti-aliasing filter seems to do a much better job with areas of low contrast than both the 60 and 70D. Shooting in live view is now a doddle, thanks to the dual pixel AF, and I have found the articulating screen very useful (despite never having really needed it before). It's still not quite perfect, but about the best you'll get in a DSLR.

The 45-point AF is accurate, as is the metering - I've had pretty consistent exposures in both aperture and shutter priority. Colour rendering is also improved, with auto white balance generally doing the job well enough for my images to require very little colour tweaking in Photoshop. I've not tried it in low light yet, but the sensitivity of the centre AF point goes down to -3EV, so it should be very comparable to my 6D. I've not noticed a huge difference in noise performance over the 50D, but then again I've not bumped the ISO up beyond 200 yet. I expect noise will be slightly better controlled than in the 50D, however I'd be surprised if it matched full-frame results.

If you're an enthusiast looking for a better, more robust body, the 80D will serve you very well. Similarly, you won't go wrong if you're a pro looking for a back up 1.6x crop factor body. Before I bought my 80D, I seriously looked at the 7DII, however that camera just didn't offer enough extra features to warrant me forking out an extra money. If you're a pro who who frequently shoots in inclement weather, or in places where your gear is likely to get bashed, the 7DII should be a consideration. The 7DII might also be better for those who do very fast action or wildlife, although the 80D is certainly no slouch when it comes to speed and accuracy!",4
Great camera for every level. Focus is fast and picture quality superb. 18 - 135 zoom lens is awsome. Buy it without any second thought.,5
"Am not understanding the logic here...camera price is 73999, camera with lens also has the same rate",1
"I was looking for a good DSLR through which I can make youtube videos. Since I self-shoot, I was also looking for one which has a complete tilt screen. I've come to love the camera so much that I am also spending time doing lots of photography

Based on my usage, here are couple of points that I found as an advantage
1. To date, its the latest Prosumer DSLR from Canon - so its not getting obsolete for the next few years (Canon usually releases a new model every 3 years)
2. The tilt screen enables you to take amazing compositions for your photography - from very low angle to above head angles. This gets your creative juices churning. For video's, since you can completely turn it around, if you are self-shooting yourself, this helps you look at yourself while making videos
3. In continuous shooting mode, the camera is fast enough to use for sports photography provide you have inserted a fast memory card
4. Coupled with the 50mm prime lens from Canon, I get sharp pictures under all light conditions

I am not raving on other features which you can anyways look up from the feature list. If you want to see videos taken from this camera as well as time lapse videos, you can look up my youtube channel which is available in my amazon profile page

If you are fence sitting between 70D and 80D, I would suggest you to go for the 70D (earlier model from Canon) only if there is a significant price difference. When I was going to buy, the price difference wasn't much, therefore I opted for 80D",4
A good product. Remember it is a CORP SENSOR CAMERA.,5
"Great , budget semi professional DSLR with cross type auto focus and dual pixel auto focus . Suit well for videography than photography. Eventough it is good for photography but it is not that much helpful in night time. 18~135mm kit lens is Recommendable. I would rate 8/10 for budget and performance ! Highly recommendable for beginning photographer with creativity !",5
"Get an amazing price.. lens and body combination is awesome.. Picture quality is good.
Touch panel auto focus is very quick.
And as a beginner i find is very handy",5
"This is one of the best camera for still and video too. It is amazing for mid level of photography.
I am using it for professional Macro photography of Dragonflies
I also use it for bird photography",5
"IT's far away good to purchase mirrorless camera as per it's valuable specification, so don't by this type of Huge camera....",1
The Auto focus could be better but that can be fixed in a firmware update rest all everything's is good. But is definitely not for beginners.,4
Hello Sir ye product muje dediye mera youtube pey channel hai Dadarkar Chetan. Mey ye product ka review kardunga or aap ke idhar sey buy kar ne ka bathaunga. Pls review product Mumbai sey Dadar kisne review product kiya nahi hai.,5
"Awesome camera below 1lakh. Since its the latest in the canon lineup it has all features for basic/mid level DSLR enthusiast. Once you master you can go for Canon 5D Mark IV that will be released in near furture.
I my opinion its better to go for this instead of basic DSLR's and you can either keep it with you for long time incase if you dont want to update to any expensive camera or or you learn alot and then update. THis suits for both amateaurs and mid level professionals. Fir more pics please visit my facebook page ""Ramana photograhy""",5

"80D!!!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU!!!! I bought this camera with 18-55mm kit lens. I can't explain you guys about my feeling when I bought this legend, but I would say one thing. Every wedding photographer will appreciate you for taking this. In every occasion that I attended, when I take my 80D out, the look on their faces have satisfied me so much! One word, LENGENDARY!",5
"delivery was fast cam it self is perfect but few things that make not very satisfied
1.SMELL yeah the cam does not smell new.
2.when i wanted to register it on edge [...] the warranty was valid but the invoice number was already registered
so i could not register completely
3.the MANUAL is printed on cheep paper and it is black&white
4.the memory card comes with it is not sandisk it is LEXAR
5.there was an small round shallow depression near serial number. I was told that refurbished products have pin hole near the serial number.
of course I did search images of bottom of 80d &ALL OF THEM HAVE THIS so no problem i think.",3
Fine piece of machinery... looks good and feels sturdy... performance is great... this one is a successor to the 70D and has many extra features... performance os much better than 70D... if one can afford then this is the best camera for video recording due to continuous auto focus feature...,5
Good prodect,5
"Hello all,
I am a photography enthusiast ..using this gear for last 3 months . I had a 60D and upgraded to this camera considering the specifications and reviews published. I mainly do wildlife photography . Here is my experience :

1. The more mega pixel may a boon for specific application only..not always.. ( 60D it was 18 MPix to 26 Mpix ) .. The images with minimum shake will be bad results in overall section
2. The ISO performance of 60D is good.. upto 640 ..here I can go one step up..upto 800 ..max 1000.. in generic condition ..After that it is very poor. Not worth for an investment as that of price (74K)
3. Dynamic range : Yes.. Good.. But also has a negative effect if you use flash..it will burnt if not applied with proper diffusion..
4.FPS: Yes more and useful for birding
5. Compatibility with older gears : Sad to say ..my older two TTL Flash ( one Nissin D866i Mark -2 and Simpex are not compatible .. Only in manual mode Sompex is working ) A BIG PAIN ..
6.The Touch screen : Very effective while using in live view mode..
7. Good for video with excellent tracking performance
8.Wifi : A must who wish to show then and their capture via social media or to the customer
9. Color saturation and rendition : 60D always give more vibrant ..output than 80D ..It's personal choice under same setting .
10. switch for aperture lock .Very effective for birding .( present in 80D)
11.Battery life ..almost same ..
12. Issue with Camera being hanged .. ( Many times with 80D ..Never had experienced with 60D).. specially when from live view to go to the viewfinder .
13.Number of AF points : For tracking any flying object ..this is very effective and 45 points all on ..is very quick..as compared to 9 of 60D

For bird photographer ..yes a good upgrade.. For macro and mammal photographers ..not worth its investment ..For landscape and product ..Not the choice ..",3
"A well built DSLR with amazing shooting capabilities. This is my First DSLR. I couldn't think of going for a basic one as with time you will have to upgrade and then ultimately you will end up loosing money in the process. Though this DSLR is a Semi Professional Camera. A beginner can also start using this with ease. I recommend this camera for all the users over other DSLR if you want a complete package Photos + Videos everything is simple and amazing. This camera has the best video shoot one can shoot. With multiple features loaded this is a perfect camera.

Also use SanDisk Extreme Pro U3 95mb/s available on Amazon. Perfect combination.

I was able to get this camera on a Deal for 65k for Canon 80D + Kit Lens 18-55mm STM . Don't think twice just grab this DSLR and forget to upgrade for 5-7 Years.. Simple. ;)",5
Best for making videos in Crop sensors camera's.,5
Best machine,5
Been using it for almost a year now. Best of the bunch!,5
good camera I got it for 45k from uae,5

"The camera is good for Autofocus but lacks image stabilization, 4K video . Videos are not tach sharp. Low light performance is bad . ALSO ITS AVAILABLE IN KOLKATA STORES AT JUST RS. 80,000. (18-135 KIT LENS).",2
Lovely camera and an equally impressive lens. Happy with the picture quality and crisp output. Totally recommended,5
The camera is too good.... Although I'll strongly recommend not to buy it from Amazon as you'll easily get the same product with more accessories offline for 66000-70000 only...,5
Awsome Camera .,5
"Awesome camera, bought it from outside,
I upgraded from 500d to 80d so it was a huge upgrade for me... Really loving the low light capabilities and the new 45point auto focus system.
Would definitely recommend.",4
"One of the best thing that I own today. Its been two months now and performance is super. Thanks to Canon.

"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 i am sorry i have been not posting any reviews from last to moths o lets get started
CANNON 80D DSLR
(NOTE This review is not paid ,this is non commercial review)
these reviews will be divided into two parts pros and cons
first we will continue with pros
1.This camera is the best camera available in the market in the price range of around 1 lakh (1300 US dollars excluding import charges)
2.This camera carries 45 AF points that means it plays best role like high end cameras in shooting music video ,documentary, and even weddings
3. Gives a tremendous low light shooting experience (personally experienced ) will upload a video in review
4.Latest generation processor that comes in high end CAMERA/DSLR like MARK 5 series and other professional camera and great processing speed with data analysing
5.Image stabilization is greatly proved in this camera that turns your video into smooth and wiggly footages
6. Screen is touch enabled that is quite impressive and great in experience while working for videolog even it is rotative
7. Battery works far more better than the other comparative range dslr model (it can gives you around whole day of backup or 10 to 16 hours depending on use)
8 It support 128gb of storage
9 It carries feature like wifi/NFC (FOR WIRELESS TRANSMISSION FOR video and pictures) ,hdmi and one of the biggest factor it carries an earphone slot to monitor your audio that's amazing and is not carried in many high end dslr
10th and the last quality is way too much sharper than other dslr and it can shoots up to 1080p in 60 frames per second (which gives you far more better quality in slow motion than other DSLR)
CONS
1st - Most irritative con is that ,it does not carries a standard canon bag that comes with every dslr not even a lens hood
2nd - It does not shoots 4k(well that's not a matter of complaining ,as no camera include 4k recording in this range except action camera)
3rd - Its not a full frame camera that i think should have been because some cameras in this range include full frame capacity
4th - ISO is not up to that range that it is meant to be in this high end DSLR I THINK IT WAS SUPPOSED to be 51000
5th - THIS dslr is quite bulky but actually it feel good to me but this is for the people who are going to use this DSLR IN their daily life
6th - it does not carries dual storage card support that now a days is trendy, well it not a matter of shame even 128bg of storage is enough
[...]",4
"I bought my canon(with 18-55 kit) from local store(babas) in Trivandrum, Kerala. I got it for 71000(canon & hdfc is running an offer - no interest on EMI!). I was closely watching the price @ amazon for last 2 months. It was always more than 74500.",5
"This review is mostly from the point of view of doing videos with the EOS 80 D, there is hardly any difference between various DSLR's in any case when it comes to photography, they all can take great pictures, starting from the Canon EOS 1300 or the Nikon 3400, the difference is primarily in the video performance.

Well this camera has no peer at this price point in the world as of now! It is great for photography but where it shines is in its video performance. The autofocus is best in the class. For serious video makers, this one offers Audio Monitoring (a feature that normally comes in much more expensive Cameras, like the Canon 7 D 2 to begin) It is also the only camera amongst DSLR's (both Canon and Nikon) in which you can have a motorised zoom. For that you also need the 18 135 Canon Nano USM lens and the PZ E1 adaptor. (I bought two PZ E 1 from Amazon US!) Unfortunately Canon has not introduced any more lenses that fit the PZ E 1. I know we had all forgotten about zooming while doing videos ever since the 5 D 2 came out almost 10 years ago. It is nice to be able to zoom once in a while!

Wish it had 4K and could make tea for me!",5
"Seems Amazon is interested in only publishing positive reviews and not facts. My earlier review was not published because I stated the fact.
Although this is an excellent product and at a discount on MRP, it is still priced higher. At retail, I got this same camera for 68000 which is 5000 less than Amazon price.",3
"I've bought this camera. It is pretty amazing camera. I would like to say you to go with it. The pictures clicked on it comes really well with 24.2mp. The details on pictures are great.
Other features are a body sealed against dust and moisture, the 80D has a polycarbonate exterior and magnesium alloy chassis. It is nearly identical in design to its predecessor, with the majority of controls accessible via the articulating rear touchscreen, as well as via physical control points. A headphone socket has been added to compliment its microphone port.",5
"price is too high. body only in ₹67000 . so 73000 with 8GB card is too high.
I give 5stars for camera",5
"I am always dreaming for this lovely cam...
In sleep this cam always come but when I wake up the lack of money kills everything... Passion etc..",5
So I bought this camera from the market at 86000Rs with 18-135usm ...the camera is superb! Better version of 70d if ur looking forward to buy a mid level camera then this is the one!,5
try mirror less cameras these dslr are super priced,1
i bot dis camera from retail shop really dis camera quality is superb..but retail price s lesser dn online,4
"I bought the camera directly from a Store in Bangalore and after 4 days display started giving problem. (there were several horizontal lines in the display). I have given the camera to the service center and they assure me of complete replacement within 10days.
Hope I get a new camera body.
I am yet to explore the camera and hope this is as good as what I see/read in the review.",3
not worth for money.. completely dissatisfied,1
Awesome camera but the price is bit too high,5
ek num bhai loga i using in filmaking is veryy good pzl,5
20-jan-2018 ko 91000 thi or 21-jan-2018 ko sidha price 1 lakh wha re mere amzon,1
I can not purchase because i have SBI debit card.. its limit is Only 75k..i tried many times but fails... i want atleast the body and lense ..please give me a solution,1
Which one a7 or 80d,3
while in cart price was 94k day after tomorrow when i going to check out price raised to 99.9k WTF. Waiting for price fall down after wards will change the review apart from this review this product is awesome just check for originality.,1
"To be frank, it's just a big body, compared to this Sony alpha 6000 is far better for half the price of this camera.. Think before buying guys",1
77d is better then 80 d ....,1
"Everything is good about the product, its features and service...",5
Awesome,5
"Ok the DSLR Giant Canon have launched 1 more entry level DSLR. Actually i bought this camera for my friend. Does this camera worth 31K. Lets see

PROS
1. Its easy to use
2. Decent battery backup
3. Live mode operation is not lagging.

CONS
1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.
2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.
3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.
4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.
5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk
6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject
7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.
I am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.
In one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.

I am not biased towards Nikon, i wrote wat i felt.
Its not worth for money",2
Good camera for beginners.,5
"Great camera. Perfect product for young budding photographer..... Useful for in-house, nature, functions, and spare time photography. Take high quality pics, videos , portrait, landscape wildlife, nature pics etc",5
"Really impressed with Amazon surprise for delivering within the 2 nd day from ordered Really packing was excellent and the quality of the material is awesome love to control the camera from mobile through Wi-Fi easy to connect, best one for taking self photos and group pics also the quality of canon speaks everything dont go for any oscillation beginners blindly got for it",5
"You are on your own if you buy this product because canon local service center is of no help even in providing the product demo. We logged the complain on canon India site and not bothered to reply. Amazon call raised its hand saying ""proof of non service"" from local service center. So we have a DSLR that is producing blur images and canon is not providing any proper service. stay away",1
"Request for replacement of camera main body There is lot of blackspot/blackness automatically appears in View finder mirror just after 15 days.
It is requested to please replace the camera as soon as possible.

Awaiting early reply.

"I have received my product DSLR Cannon 1500D at 15 the October 2018 . But Adopter has not been given along with the DSLR which is a very common accessories.
They must deliver that as soon as possible.Otheewise I gave to complain about it again & again.",2
"Auto focus is not at all perfect.
Minimum aperture is 4.5, so dont expect much in portrait.
While focusing manually there is a play for the lense(18-55 mm) so that there is a chance for getting missing ur focus even though if ur made it correctly.
Easy to operate compared to Nikkon models.
Fast moving subjects cannot be captured as expected due to its poor auto focus performance. It take about 3 to 6 seconds to focus in internal lighting conditions and it fail to focus several times in dim lights.
Plastic quality is poor.
I got it for Rs.18599. So that it is a value for money product. Don't go for this model if ur willing to pay about 23k. Better go with Nikkon 5300.",3
If you want to upgrade your camera from point and shoot to a dslr then it is a good camera for you but if you want to start videography then don't buy it auto focus of video is too much bad. If you want a camera for videography then go foe canon 200D or Nikon D5600,4
"I am really fully content with the product. It reached me within two days with everything content in it and no doubt in a very good condition. It may be somewhat difficult for the beginners but it will not take a long to learn. If you are choosing between canon and Nikon I will suggest you canon because of its real colour capturing and fine focus of its lenses. You can get more slightly more features in Nikon than canon at the same price but that doesn't mean that will surely better than canon. You can look for contrast between canon and Nikon in the internet. I think it will suggest you the same""canon"".",5
"Canon Has Cheated The entire photography community. if you are a photographer and use flash or studio lights this camera is not for you. do not buy external flash and studio ligits like elinchrom and godox will not work. .

reason why i am saying this.

the mount on with the flash is put has one point of contact missing. in 1500d they have removed the main point of contact . 1300d has it. go for 1300d .",1
"Dear friends i buy this camera for my YouTube career😞 and if you’re buying this camera for your YouTube career then its not for you. Bcz this camera doesn’t have mic input, and its also not takes a great videos, you’re not able to record great videos without mic input. No auto focus option in video recording, basic camera 📷!!
This camera only good for pictures clicks!",2
"This camera is a perfect choice if you are a beginner. The price range is decent, the camera is user friendly. I recommend everyone to buy this camera if you have a tight budget.",5
"I paid Rs 20240 for this product and have read some of the reviews, and I can say I bought it expensive. Some people got it for Rs 18000 in the offer period. I tried some of its features and felt terribly disappointed. The autofocus is a joke here. It takes forever to click a photo in just slightest low light. I was very annoyed. I feel like I should have bought a cyber shot instead. Nikon D3500 is way better than it hands down in terms of clarity of photographs, quality, ISO, battery, grip and display. However, you'll have to pay Rs 3000-4000 more, but that's worth it. You don't buy DSLRs every day. Choose a better camera.",1
Good Product who are really have passion for photography,5
"Got dual lens with body in just 28K with SBI MASTERCARD. EXACTLY HALF OF SHOWROOM PRICE.
Too early to comment.
Excellent delivery within 2 days.
I can say it is best for beginners with more natural photos than NIKON
Pros:
Handy
Easy to use
Best blur with 55-250 lens
Various modes
Natural Colour
Fast autofocus
Best fit for beginners

Cons:
Lack of touchscreen (Look at the price)
Bluetooth is not available
You can't operate your Camera after connecting with smartphone.
No WiFi connectivity is available with laptops.
Suffer a bit at low light.

Overall it is best for beginners and even upto semi pro level!!!!",4
"Thanks to amazon and the courier partner for the quick delivery. Well it was an awesome deal from amazon purchased it for around ₹21.5k with a free gift Motorola wired headphone worth ₹650.
Coming to the camera it’s a great learning camera especially for the beginners who love photography and also want themselves to enhance here. My personal experience after using it for a week for now with the combination of shutter speed,aperture and ISO with a desired white balance you can be click practically any of the desired picture that you want to click.

The camera comes with a 18-55 lens that is self acclaimed for beginners. Do master your parameters with this lens then you can obviously go for desired range of lens available in the market.

The only shortcoming that I personally found was the focus which need to be adjusted manually/you need to have patience while clicking raw pictures. But this is again not a shortcoming for sure this is the area you need to improve yourself over the camera.",4
The camera is in good condition...I have received the charger and the battery but it doesn't charge the battery....charger received is faulty..don't know how to go about it....as really frustrated ..there is no return policy also....,1
"It's a best entry level DSLR camera if you have used only point and shoot or mobile. It has built in guide which makes it easier to use and learn. The auto focus and pictures quality is also very good but some time in low lit situations it generates noiy in pictures for that use extra flash other wise best. Videos are also very good for blogging video use manual focus which is very eyes to use with best results. It's better than Nikon d3500 as videos, auto focus and features are better in this camera. If your budget is limited and you are new in DSLR then it's a must buy.",5
"Amazon was dispatched this camera on 08.10.2019 at home and i went to some official trip on that time hence i was not able to check its operation. I came home on 23.10.2019 and opened this product, captured some images and it was good. Later i tried to transfer the images from Camera to mobile through Wifi and found the camera getting switched off. I tried several times and the problem remain same. Further i tried to return the camera and the seller is not accepting my request as the date of return is already crossed.

I have contacted my friends who is working in photo studio regarding this and they have expressed that the Canon EOS 1500D is having such types of problem and we have seen many of the cameras having such problems.

We request buyers who is willing to buy this product, pls avoid online purchases of this product. Verify before purchasing.

Now i request Amazon to help us regarding this issue.",1
"This may be a good camera for the very experienced professional of photography. It is challenging for a newcomer in photography.
1-Flash Makes too much noise
2-You cannot record a good quality of sound because it does not support any external mice.
3-This camera does not support any audio jack for recording sound.
4-Wifi does not control the video recording function
5-No Bluetooth connection could be established with other devices.
6-This camera is manufactured recently, but it does not have recent audio jack.
7-They are using very old audio jack technology. If the external audio jack is compatible, then canon should give the one connectin cable and audio jack which complies with the camera, but unfortunately, the camera does not provide it.

Thus it is concluded it is an outdated product is dumped in the Indian market through Amazon platform.
if canon disprove me, I will remove this product review or update it",1
"First of all thanks Amazon for giving such a wonderful offer , my dream comes true and finally I have dslr....Picture quite is awesome in both day light as well as low light. Still learning the different modes of camera for taking pictures. For beginners it's little difficult to handle but there is an auto mode that can be used if you don't understand anything. But quality of pic comes better when you set the camera manually",5
"I have purchased this for my brother last year from Amazon.
I got the single kit. slightly disappointed due to that. Otherwise....
*Excellent DSLR for beginners.
*Easy to use.
*Good quality.
*Decent battery backup.
*Worth for money

Fact: If your expectations are high with the stabilization or photo output etc then please go for Canon 5D/7D. This is for beginners (21K) and so if you buy this then keep your expectations as much you pay. :p :)",5
"I had only 3 hours to make the decision. Next day I had my flight to Korea and we thought of buying a DSLR at night (didn't make a decision earlier, as we had One+ and iPhone which are kind of best in class for the camera). So, I quickly did research and found just 3-4 options. I watched 2-3 YouTube videos to make the final call and guess what I made the right choice. I took next day morning delivery paying 50 rs extra. The camera is superb (5 stars). Though I handled a Sony camera earlier, this is my first DSLR and believe me, it was quite easy to follow their instructions manual. I would highly recommend you to read the manual / try at home/rehearsal before you go out to capture actual pictures. I am attaching a few pics which I captured with just 2 hours of the experiment.",5
The battery is faulty .... It drains even when not in use,1
"WARRANTY CAN BE REGISTERED!! IT HAS 2 YRS WARRANTY!!!
Just finished registering the camera and lens.
Great camera. You will love it. Very steady. Great buy to start your hobby/profession. Don't compare to other cameras. At 26k good its a great dslr with 2yrs warranty. Should take care of parties, weddings and video shoots. Excellent battery life. The camera case is good.
It has no external mic in.",5
I wanted to return this order on the same day and purchase Canon 200D as I did not like it.. but never had an option to do that. Tried contacting CX care a number times and nobody were of any help to me. Atlease got a chance to ask for assistance regarding the return. I still have it packed as it is.. I am not at all happy with the product and have not even charged the battery even once.,1
Picture quality fantastic and camera handling and features are very good which will attract a beginner.,4
"Let me explain.

Yes, with 9 point AF with the OVF, you'll feel the AF a bit dated but does the job rather well. Live view has face detect but has a jerky continuous AF and is slow.

But those are most of its negatives.

The camera takes wonderful pictures and with digic 4+ image processor, the jpegs are perfectly usable. If you want perfection, shooting in RAW will give you what you need.

The colors captured on this camera are perfect and natural, with settings to tweak them to your taste (see picture settings in menu).

The build quality is solid and ergonomics of the camera, especially through its grip is wonderful. It feels perfect in my hands. The menu system is uncluttered and quite intuitive. It is very easy to customize the camera to your specific needs.

You can shoot videos with this camera but without continuous AF, you'll get better results if you switch to manual focus during video.

Why is it the best DSLR?
Because of it's limitations in AF and simple straightforward usability it lets you take control over your photographs and videos unlike other advanced models which take control away from you and makes the choices for you. The result is you can get the exact photograph you intended to take. Combined with the 24 megapixel sensor, which is the same sensor found in almost all other canon APSC DSLRs, all the way upto 80D, the image quality is at par with much more expensive cameras.

The digic 4+ processor is good for image processing, frankly the more advanced processors bring features such as 4K and such, which if you're not into video, you'll not miss it. The digic 4+ processor is more than adequate for your photography needs.

With all the above considerations, it's the best DSLR you could get, in my opinion.",5
"Excellent camera for both beginners and advance users, 24.1 Mp gets your pictures crystal clear. I suggest to get this deal before it ends",5
This amazon playing very cheap games to the customers. I have ordered this product on 29th for almost 29k and now the sale daybits cost around 23k. How fooling the customers for this kind of false pricings and every product has 10days return policy but now its not acceptable reurns it accepts only replacement. What a cheap gameplay amazon. If you really think about the customer do some promising thing not such kind of fraud things. Never ever i buyer in amazon again. Good bye. You lost a loyal customer. I may not do anything for you except stop ordering from you. That enough to added advantage to your competitors.,1
Delivery boy not calling for pick up the product as I returned the item,1

1.amazing picture quality
2. Handy
3.light weight
4.gripping is good

6. Memory card and one battery is included

Cons:

"First of all. I ordered this product in Amazon great sale at 34000, but next day the price was 30000. I am very disappointed with it. Camera is for beginners, who wants to learn about basic photography. It's for casual use. If you want a proper professional camera for photography, then I would suggest go for 70d or further.",1
"I bought this camera, its was working well with 18-55 lens, but when i move to 55-255 the performance was low.
battery backup also very less.
But overall good camera. At night 55-255 lens take hell alot time to focus.
So my suggestion is go for 200D. Amazon wont refund for it, so i sell the camera on OLX",3
"Camera is gud one..... But i brought it on 'no cost emi (970.86)' of 6months @25376.14 after the deduction of 970.86. Now my EMI is 4391.16 for 6months...that comes 26346.96...

So my question is how will i get the no cost benefit of 970.86?",2
This camera is only for photography ...u can't record a good video... because it doesn't have continuous autofocus while video recording....even mobile phones have that function.... the auto focus is fixed while video recording...like if u move in your video..then u get out of focus...which is disgusting.. because video means a movie a moving object...,1
"The product is absolutely perfect but Amazon service is not professional. Don't buy this if you are going to shoot videos bcoz it doesn't support mic, Amazon will not tell you this in their description of product. I lost my 10k because of Amazon they mention ""10 days returnable"" but it is actually ""10 day exchangeable"". They totally denied to take it back. Be careful when you are buying it.",3
"I have purchased this Canon DSLR after a small research. It's results were fantastic as a digital camera. But just after few months of purchase I found that sometimes it's shutter starts operating automatically without clicking any picture. Sometimes it worked ok but sometimes automatically opening and closing of shutter with annoying noice started. Then I contacted Canon serice centre. They gave me address of local service centre at Jabalpur MP. I gave them my camera for repairing. They sent it to Indore city workshop and it took nearly one and half month to return me. It was working ok at that time but after few days that shutter problem started again.
Now I can not give this camera to workshop again and again so I am using this faulty camera as sometimes it works ok but sometimes it doesn't work due to shutter problem.
I thought earlier that Canon was excellent brand but now my thinking is totally changed about it.",1
"Candid pics, excellent picture clarity best in this price you can't ask for more. Great cam for first DSLR folks.
The disappointment is only with the Courier service, have been very pathetic service with Amazon delivery and it's been so worst since a couple of months recently. Amazon should rethink of the Courier partner. Will be a big drawback with this worst way of the delivery service .",5
"For beginners this is a great option
Go for it if you are learning basics of photography
Image quality is decent
Low light photography you have to control on own
Rest all covered",5
This is a review about the seller ... Please think twice before you purchase anything from this seller ... The camera I had recieved was not seal packed ... It had a tape to give the illusion... And the camera had a very very light scratch on the screen and these were some of the red alerts and bingo there came the real issue ... The menu button was faulty ...,1
Canon 1500 is the best entry level DSLR and its very easy and convenient to use..the canon connect app is jst superb.. u dnt have to worry abt transfering the pics from the memory card..jst connect the DSLR through its inbuilt wifi to ur smartphone and jst view or download any pic..save it in ur phone..laptop... u can also view and click from ur smartphone..this is the best function of the camera..the DSLR works well even in low light..i have tried clicking pics without using flash..and they came out superb..images are crisp and there is no issue of the pixelisation..day time images are superb no doubt..,5
I used it only 4 or 5 times till now and it’s not working properly.i was thinking that it might be setting problem but no it’s not a setting problem when I press the click button it stuck and on the screen it always show busy or error. I got frustrated when I pick it up for clicking pictures. With this problem first I have to switched it off and then on then it work only for 1 click after it again it show busy and the click button not work even I m not able to press it . It gets jam all the time.kindly do the needful bcz it’s in still warranty.,2
"Pictures taken with basic lens. Full zoom. Manual mode. Retouched on iph 11. Small size here. Real pix r lifelike. Happy with purchase. Canon website is extremely bad designed n thr s bo straightforward way 2 update warranty like lenovo. Wrote them a mail attaching invoice, no acknowledgement nothing. Camera is good, hopefully won't have to visit service center in 2 years. For any problem check youtube videos. Ths s my 1st n only DSLR. D performance of a camera s not in words bt in its pictures. ₹23.5k.

OF COURSE THE INVOICE NUMBER BY APPARIO DOWNLOADED HERE FROM PRODUCT PAGE WAS DECLARED INVALID INVOICE NUMBER BY CANON INDIA WARRANTY PAGE.",5
"This is my first camera. The pictures are great. Video quality is acceptable for such a mid level cost. The images are high resolution and good even in low light. Same for videos.
For beginners like me,it takes a few weeks just to learn various settings like auto and manual focus. Aperture and shutter.. and ISO...

Youtube is very useful for first time user to get familiar with the settings.

The seller was very nice. Delivery was good and product was authentic,as always!

The quality is good with free bag and a 16 GB sd card,but had to buy 128 gb as 16 gb is low space for a camera that takes high resolution images and videos.

Just go for it.",5
"I'm using this camera from past 6 months and I will recommend this product to beginners if they get it at around 20k.
You can get great photos using it.
To improve quality of photos even more, 50mm prime lens is recommended.
Added benefit is having wifi and NFC to easily transfer your photos to share it with world
Although don't buy it for making videos.

I have added some photos that clicked using it for you to see.",5
"I need to return or replace the Product, as it was not informed to me by canon or amazon that Canon EOS1500D has the hot shoe which has only 4 points not the main 5th one, thus it does not support the studio lights by trigger.

Being a genuine customer, visited whole Mumbai city to buy its adopter, but not available before asking Amazon & Canon to return or replace the product, but they simply getting away by saying Return Window is closed...not fair",1
"I have bought this for product photography but I am strange that this is totally worst camera result that I never seen after 1 year of usage, There is autofocus issue in the camera, this camera does not taking autofocus for all the products at a time.

I have tried so many times and lots of option wise selection also, but these is totally waste of money camera if you purchase it for autofocusing facility.

Please do not buy these camera , as it is totally waste of money, nothing else.",1
"Great product, I naught this 1 day before my family trip. Had no professional photography experience still the pictures were perfect (through auto mode)

Have been exploring the features for while now and if a beginner is looking for phone then this is must have.

I ordered for only 1 lens and now I regret the decision as the 55-250 lens is very costly if naught separately. Would suggest anyone to go for both lenses if the budget permits. Though the 18-55 lens is just fine but if you need to zoom more then not much helpful.",5
It's a great product but the price fluctuates between 24k to 30.5 k which is a big difference.I have even found PPL buying it for 20.5 k .So please wait for the offers to make it a real value for money deal.The add on lens should come with more affordable packages.,5
"If you just want to start DSLR Photography but at the same time a bit confused which model to buy , don't think twice go for EOS 1500D . First of all I would like to clear any some doubts .
1.You will get your DSLR Shoulder bag with your camera .
2.The Kit lens is 18-55 II lens
3.The memory card you get with the package can give you the speed hoto 48mbps . If you want good SDHC Memory card you can go for Sandisk 32 gb or Higher . It will give you a speed of 90mbps.
4.You will get a diopter adjustment dial just at the right side of the optical view finder.
5.Screen brightness at level 4 is probably enough for everyone , where you can extend the lcd brightness hoto 8th level . You van guess how much bright it's actually . Easy for outdoors also.

👉 It's a bit noisy when you shoot in low light , so try to keep atleast minimum light source near your object . Try to keep ISO minimum , change your shutter speed , keep it at 1/10 or lower if the condition outside is too much dark .
The price for which I got these is around 24000 . At this amazing price you are getting a branded DSLR which is basically for beginners , so you may have some complaints about the stuff but believe me it's probably the best option out there with a huge range of modes and operations. Go and grab it, start your experiments with your frames 😊😊😊 .",5
The product was delivered in less than 8 hours. Thanks to Amazon Prime. The product was deliveded in good condition with all accessories as mentioned on Amazon. I'm a new user for DSLr and this camera is very easy to use there are most commonly used modes typebfor photography and it comes really handy. Picture quality and resulting is good for a enter level DSLR,5
"M writing this review after usage of 1.5 years of canon1500D:-

The camera is good - only for new comers into photography.. If you’re a photographer who does paid shoot or is interested in various amounts of genre in photography then I suggest to go with a lil high budget of another camera. This camera is good only with 50MM lens.. if you click pictures with the 18-55 MM lens then you are gonna definitely face issues with Noise in the picture.. same if you use 55-250 there is a high chance if getting shaken images also adding noise into it..if u have budget issues and are very good with post processing skills then you can go for it or else not..

Overall:-

Picture Quality:- 3
Auto Focus:- 4
Battery life:- 5",4
"This is my first DSLR. I will mention few points below which i liked and sumthing i didnt liked.
LIKED:
1) Its good for day time photography
2) its lightweight
3) Its good for normal photography
4) 55 - 250mm lens very good for bokey effect

DISLIKED:
1) Kit lens not so good
2) Flash too bright
3) Night time photo not good.
4) Quality feels average
5) photo quality average",3
"For a DSLR, it is relatively compact, light in weight and easy to operate. Although certainly a step up from a smartphone, it’s just not all that exciting or satisfying to use for anyone with a deep interest in photography. Build quality is good enough to withstand normal usage, although not rough treatment and neither the camera nor the lens is weatherproof. The kit lens is an average performer across its focal length range. I'd recommend paying extra for stabilisation if you add a telephoto lens to the basic package.
It lacks in some features, especially with the 30fps recording, 9-point focus system and the lack of a headphone jack, but if you are into photography, the camera makes up for it with the still great picture quality and amazing battery life for its price. I doubt it would provide the best stepping stone for beginners who want to improve their mastery of photography.",4
"This is my first camera and I'm extremely happy with my choice. It is just the right DSLR for a beginner. The displayed instruction for every function helps you to navigate yourself through them. Within a day or two you will know everything about it. It has a really fast auto focus and the picture quality is absolutely stunning. Being a beginner, I feel that I couldn't have chosen a better one.",5
I am using this for couple of months. In this model Canon has removed the center pin in Hot Shoe. Hence most of cheaper after market external Speedlight flashes cannot be used in this DSLR model. Very few models can be used which are TTL capable - but those are above 4K INR. So anyone looking to buy this please be prepared to invest in costly Canon or third party Speedlight Flashes. Inbuilt Flash is of no use.,1
"This is hands down, best entry level camera for regular use. Begin with auto mode (auto focus, auto flash everything auto). Explore and learn slowly on your own or by watching some videos on youtube, and become an expert in no time. Once you become professional, you can be the photographer at your own wedding. All the best",5
"It’s good for a beginner I must say not for the someone who’s looking for more features in a economical price. I wanted a Camera for a purpose of shooting YouTube and small Events. We’ll never mind we all can always have the best with the option of just a click.
Five keys to take away from this experience.
• Best for beginners
• Not very economical for the price
• Amazon has the options needed
• Canon’s playing with it’s good will
• Well, never mind nobody’s going to take it seriously",3
This is my first ever DSLR and this is been a great experience pictures are so great that I gained a professional confidence that I can click good pictures thanks to cannon for introducing such a great entry level DSLR at this affordable price by Amazone.Battery is also long lasting and very easy to use.i must suggest everyone who is looking for an entry level DSLR please go for this.,5
"Absolute value for money at 23500 (price I purchased for)

Has a 24 MP lens with the latest in-class sensors and controls and even enhanced options like dioptre corrections. For a beginner it even has a setting with creative filters applied automatically to scene which I find to be useful.",5
"Writing the review after a year of use.
I was searching for beginners camera and choose EOS 1500D and bought it at a very valued price during Great Indian sale.
The performance of the camera is stunning and the quality of the pictures is really great. You need to get the basics settings right for a good picture.
I've used it for both indoor and outdoor photoshoots and have got a great output. The battery backup is also long lasting.
If you are looking for a DSLR for beginners I will 100% recommend you this.
Thank you Canon and Amazon.",5
"This one is....I bought this camera for clicking my pictures for Instagram... and this one is amazing...my insta feed is full of awesome picture,reel and video...if you want to know final result then go check out my Instagram...",5
"If you need a DSLR and you don't take many photos go for this.

Quality is so good. Auto Focus and other things are sooo good but after 1 year you may feel to go for a higher version if you are so interested with photography.. but very good product for beginners and people who need a DSLR and for ppl who take photos occasionally",5
Actually I loved this product and ordered as combo offer with tripod+16gb card+ case +uv filter 58mm. Once I placed the order it's split into three separate order and uv filter will be placed an order for 62mm. Again I reach out to CX team and they processed exchange with same item.. now they are telling you are received what you oredered... Not even understand my concern. One major thing I was not received 16gb card along with the camera.. I have tried to get 16gb card with on whole day. But they keep on disconnect the chat on call and said we have to return the whole camera.. when order solit into separate orders why should I return whole things !!! Worst customer service ever and ever...they all rude.,5
"The camera is an excellent option for those who are just newly stepping into photography field as it can give them all the tools needed to develop their skills.
Performance as an entry-level camera is good. It has Wifi inbuilt in so the users can transfer their files from the camera to smart devices.. Canon1500D has a superior sensor over the older EOS 1300D Thus, overall image quality is much better. Color saturation is decent and a fair amount of sharpness , As far as noise is concerned, the camera handles shots well up to ISO 1600 with a little amount of grains Even at ISO 800, the noise levels are acceptable. Increasing ISO to 1600 increases the noise but the images were still good enough to be shared on social medias. Autofocus is fast enough when using the viewfinder but once switch to Live View mode and it really struggles to get the focus. Overall i would recommend the camera to anyone who is starting into photography .
Here are a few of my shots clicked using this camera.",5
"Ordered this product for Rs. 21,990/- using Prime on 22.10.2019 at 10:00PM & Received it on the Very Next Morning! Product was Packed Tight Perfectly in Sealed condition.

Box contains: Camera Body, 18-55 Lens, Strap, Battery, Battery Charging Adapter & Wire, Kingston 16GB Memory Card, A Carry Case, Warranty Card and Guide.

Turned it On After mounting the Lens to the body and started to Click Pictures and I must Say The Quality of the Pictures are Damn Great and Amazing. Tried Clicking some Pictures of Potraits, Close Up's and in Flash off Mode and the Results had Awestruck me!

Also Connected the Camera to My Mobile Using WiFi and Canon Camera Connect App from PlayStore as this Product supports WiFi and NFC. Using Remote Access I had Controlled Camera and clicked Few Images and it seemed perfect. WoW

I have Noticed that Autofocus is a Bit Slow. Will talk about this in the later part after proper utilisation.

I Conclude that this is a Must buy Camera for Beginners and Hobby Photographers at a very Reasonable Price.",5
"It's a great camera and picture quality is really nice.
I can really feel the difference of 24.1MP in photo quality in comparison of photos clicked in my older 18.1MP 1200D camera.
Received a super deal on this during Amazon Great Indian Festival. Big thank you to Amazon for that.",5
"After using this for 1 week got to know like its perfect for beginners who are at entry level, good autofocus, 24.1 MP CMOS sensor works well better than 3000d, the shutter speed is a bit slow, 3 snaps per second, except that everything is perfect (for beginners)

Lens provided Along with this is not soo good
Use a prime lens and you can do wonders",4
"I'm using this product for the past two months here i list some of the good and bad.
Good:
Battery life
Low cost
Image quality
Easy for beginners
Value for money
Wifi share

BAD:
Plastic material body
Less photoshoot options
UI is not up to the mark",4
"Honest Review: this canon camera is not good for beginners,, better to go for good point and shoot camera or good quality mobile bcoz when you shoot your video this will not give you any auto focus to moving object. So this will just give auto focus to a particular object only and when your object go front and back.. this get automatically blurred in case of video. This is my honest review so don't buy this camera for YouTube video like cooking, art and craft etc. You don't get return and refund so go to shop and try the camera range before buying for your particular purpose. For photography you can buy this. But for video this is the worst camera I ever used. I don't expect such a bad autofocus.. after doing manual focus settings then also this camera will stuck to that particular silent no motion,,, object only. We shoot video for moving things.. so worst buy. 1500d is totally worst for video.",3
"Please see the unboxing photos as attached along with this review. Carefully check before placing orders what you are going to get. Memory card will not be part of this. I found camera bag missing. Also SD card slot does not have the tray/container to insert a SD card, even though you buy a SD card on your own separately. Also see the picture carefully, without lens the camera will look like as shown in the picture. I wanted to capture all accessories included when I got it delivered. Conclusion: amazon FBA is not justifying with customers. Canon original product definitely has all accessories even including SD card I believe. Now I doubt about the quality of packing and condition of the camera, never know it's just an used product got delivered. Moreover, the product does not have refund policy. Be very careful before placing an order.",1
I did not receive memory card and bag with the camera. Now I am unable to test it. I can see other people have received both items along with the camera. My camera box does not have sticker mentioning the SD card. Canon should have included it.,3
"You can take brilliant photos with this camera ( if you know how to use it properly)
Picture quality is nice
Nice auto focus ( suffers during low light)
The smartphone connect app is useful...
Better to buy extra lens.
Kit lens is not that much powerful,but you can take great photos with it,If you want.
Camera is just a tool,it's all about your talent.
Am completely satisfied with this product
Amazon packaging was great,they took serious protective measures.
Thanku Amazon, Canon , The seller and all the persons who brought this item to me.",4
"Bought it for my dad and would recommend it for absolute beginners who want to grow out of mobile photography and get some more out of their clicks.

If are buying this camera, stop shooting in auto mode as auto mode is same as a mobile camera so not worth buying of you'll be shooting auto. Buy a point and shoot instead if you'll just be using auto.

Also buy only for photography, Video recording is garbage and you would be better of recording from a mobile camera.

In short, great for beginner photographers as a first dslr.",5
"Best for beginner photography. It's been more than 6 months now. I bought this camera with the 18-55 lens for 21k and a 2k debit card discount on top (net: 19k). I have learnt a lot in terms of photography. The continuous shot speed is very less (3 fps) and the autofocus isn't that great but does the job.

For the price this is a value for money camera.

This is a very portable camera. With time you can upgrade your lenses.

If you're are really into photography or want to explore it with a minimal budget this should be your purchase

If you want to check out more photos from this camera and ask any queries personally, check it my Instagram id: @pixelbug_abhi",4
"super camara, picture qulity very clearly, auto focus amazing and beginners go for it blindly...5 star rating overall, very smooth and hendy camara and its lcd display cool and bright also camara easy work and fast photo capture, wife to connect mobile features i like it,. but amazon delivery so late. i order 1/10/2019 and packeg arrived 7/10/2019.. 7 days for wait...not speedy prosses",5
"Great DSLR for begeners......amazing quality ant trust of canon
Recomended for all photo enthusist and normal household events and functions.

Good user experience...
Camera bag it came with is not that giod.....recomended to chenage it foe added safty",5
"was very happy for the price that i got at 19,990 during the sale. Camera works well but i did not explore all the options. Hope it's good for beginners to play around.",5
"Hi , Just Purchased this Device in Amazon Great Indian festive sale . Camera Quality is Superb . Useful for beginners like me . camera functions are easy you will learn all function in a day or two . Also ordered 50mm lens for the same . Samples attached are taken with 50mm lens.",5
"A pretty decent camera not only for beginners but for experienced photography enthusiasts as well. My suggestion to those who are buying their first DSLR- spend a couple of days learning / experimenting the manual mode, you'll have some awesome pictures after that. The bundled lens is good in most of the situations, low light auto-focus could be a bit better. All in all, this is a good camera at this price.",5
Been using this for about a year now and it really works great as a DSLR is supposed to. But just reflecting back on why I bought this camera at this price I think I was better off buying a smartphone with good camera. The camera is good no doubt but the smartphone cameras have also developed alot. So buying this camera for an average person may not be the ideal choice But still it is a good DSLR for it's price. 😊,4
"1. Purchase date:- 14-05-2020 with one year warranty
Warranty expiry date of camera I checked from canon wedsite:- 10-12-2021
The date and month should be same, That means warranty starts 6 months before the purchase date with two year warranty.
2. The camera package seal was broken. both camera and lense was simply put in the box without any cover.
3. Camera strap was missing.
I returned the item for replacement.

Here I am attaching the screenshots from the video I took while unpacking.",1
"Poor customer support
Product quality not upto the mark
My 13000rs Sony camera which is 5 years old is far better than this
Data transfer cable also missing

Bough it on Amazon sale
But am least happy with this product

My Samsung phone takes better pictures than this",1
"I love this camera...it taught me so much about lighting, shutter speed and angles...plus since it's so cheap I am able to practice more from it without fearing it would breaking it
The colors are natural yet vibrant. It's lovely",5
"Bought from Appario. Two orders and one replacement - seal broken in all three cases so returned the camera. Bought it for 33.5k first and now, with JJ Mehta - it is > 38k. All in 10-15 days time.",2
"Best for beginners.
-Image quality is really crisp.
-Can capture video 1080p @30FPs and 720p @60FPs. On NTSC video system.
-Build quality is also good.
-18-55mm lens is also fine for the beginning.
-Night quality is good but do not expect that much.",5
"Good for Beginners. Using this product for more than year now and working perfectly fine. Purposely did'nt wrote review earlier. Now I can say this product is really good. Amazon delivered in good way.
Recommande to Beginners who are looking for good DSLR.",5
"It's a good camera for beginners.
Update: I found that the mini USB cable was not working. When I registered the camera in canon edge website, I got an option to extend the warranty but it didn't extend for 1 year, I just got 4 months extra, which means that the camera was registered long back.
I just checked the manufacturing date and was surprised to see that it was manufactured over 17 months ago!
Please check the camera thoroughly for any bad signs.
I applied for replacement and let's see.....what happens.",1
Amazon delivered a second hand product.The Canon Digital camera package seal was broken and it was opened several times by previous users. The camera was with full of finger print marks. There was no provision for return of product. I am not satisfied with a second hand product with price for the original product.,3
"Very beginner friendly. I bought it for my cousin who is a complete newbie in photography. And he took this picture (attached) in his first day. The focus speed is not as good as Nikon entry levels, and the battery backup is slightly worse as well. But the color profile is much better in Canon. The details are very close to Nikon D5600. Only major negative is fixed display. But again wifi mobile connection really helps.",5
"I can say it's a best camera for photography.
This is my first dslr I bought during Amazon sale @22k. I was confused between nikon d3500 & canon 1500d after getting the amazing feedback from my photographer friends I chose to go with canon brand.

This was my first shoot I did with the 18-55mm kit lense & got wonderful results. I'm looking forward to buy 1 50mm F1.4 lens to upgrade my potrait shoot.
Thanks alot Amazon your service & support can never be matched!",5
"Got it for 19k during festival sales
Incredible for that price
Easy to use and good picture quality

Easy to transfer photos via nfc
Good battery also",5
I am using past 6 months and till now I am very much satisfied from this product using day light photography but I do not know what settings are required to capture night light photo.. using default auto setting. So it's drawback or my lack of knowledge. If I get setting details from product seller then fine picture quality at night then I will revise my rating.,4
It's my first time DSLR very nice product.i really like it .I also inquiry before purchasing it canonn 1500d . I found Nikon 3500 vs to canonn 1500d . really it's very nice . but Amazon company delivery person very bad.he didn't delivery my mention My attitude is dependent upon the way u treat me..i will take my product another person talk with him.amazone company should be look into this matter,5
"Battery was not gud enough even after charging for long hours
First time we didn't get fine photos, aft getting help from professional photographer we got the settings done and know that Battery is the oly problem but camera is gud",3
I got defective lens and no buddy is helping me,1
"I like very much this , image quality is vet nice First things first, it’s an incredibly functional DSLR that takes sharp images with a natural feel to them and also offers a good video quality. More importantly for beginners, however, it manages to do that right out of the box, which allows beginners to get taking great pictures and recording quality videos as soon as they unbox the DSLR.",5
"False advertisement
No touchscreen
Lens doesn't do a good job
Makes too much sound while focussing
No good focus at all.
Blurry videos
No flash in videos.
.
.
It's my First day with this camera
And I'm highly highly highly disappointed.
Please
I repeat please DO NOT PURCHASE IT
EVEN IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER.
Else you will cry like me",1
"This Camera is the King of Budget segment Cameras.
This camera gives you excellent results only if you know how to use a dslr.
The 55-250 lens is more reliable than 18-55.
To reduce the focusing noise use stm or usm lens.
Build quality is mind blowing..
Used the camera for 1 year and is extremely Satisfied.
Best camera for beginners and for others you can use this as a secondary camera.
Battery life is decent.
For New users who are not excellent in manual mode can approach youtube and learn the basics.
Other modes are not useful.Use Av,Tv,M modes for photography.
Video quality is poor as this is not a video camera.
The Wifi Feature is handy and makes transfering of images quick.
50mm Lens suits excellent for the camera.
You can check my insta handle for images captured using this camera mr.panicker__

Negative:
Low light photography is not impressive
Produces grains at high iso 6400",5
"It's an awesome product from the home of 'Canon'. Product is really very fine to handle. Thanks to the Amazon team.
If you're a beginner, then you can go for the basic training classes through YouTube or an instructor. Functionality of the product is far interesting & a beginner should learn step by step.
In the end, the product is worth for you in an unique budget. Go for it 👍",5
"Some people believe that online shopping is not safe for digital items .but it's not true .I have been buying products from Amazon for 3 years. I didn't receive any of the item as damaged.It was a very big decision of mine to buy an item of heavy amount through online shopping, I was thinking that it would come damaged or broken but after receiving it I will say that it is best for normal people who use to click photos everywhere they travel as Nikon is good for the photographers .I will recommend the viewers of the product to surely buy this .👍",5
Amazing picture quality even with the kit lense..colors are very much natural...for beginner its a very nice camera.. light weight...i wish this could have rotating LCD viewer screen but thats not an big issue..,5
"Best for beginners and if you are buying this for vlogging purposes i will not recommend it because it is very hard to handle without a gimbal or tripod.
Picture quality is superb and video quality is good.
Battery capacity is very good comparing to other models of canon.
Auto focus is fine and inbuilt flash is superb.
Wifi and nfc are Woking fast and no lag at all.
I recommend this for professional videographers and YouTubers the most.",4
"For the beginner, this is a perfect choice. Also, I got a huge discount on this one on Prime day. Thanks to Amazon :)
The only problem I am facing is unable to register its 2 years warranty on the canon website. However, Amazon also solved this issue by providing the same 2 years warranty on this product.",5
A great product for beginners. Got it for 21k during amazon sale and using sbi card cash back. Worth every penny if u really want to click your moments and cherish later. Even my wife is also much comfortable using this camera since it has screen view mode. Also the automode sets the ISO and white balance allowing clicking shots without looking for a setting if u r in a hurry. Wifi connect is very convinient. U can just download whichever image u like.,5
"Good camera, but no external mic port.. if you want a camera with external voice recorder please select some other one. Without knowing this I had purchased this, even the same day return also not possible with Amazon. But camera is awesome, try to purchase with combo lense otherwise lense cost will be more.",5
"DO NOT BUY

Canon has tried to create monopoly through this model. Hot shoe has been changed so now only canon flash lights will work with this model i.e. Canon eos 1500d.
They have NOT even mentioned this anywhere on amazon or on their website, not even the dealers of canon know this new development.

The LCD screen could have been given a flap covering which was in previous models.",2
"Good camera
Started loving it and i could able to use the cam as a pro
Autofocus is so bad on kitlens i don't know is it same on other lens
Night snaps are average and if you gys can use on manual mode you will get awesome results if it's on auto night photography is little bit bad
Overall it's a perfect choice for beginners
Not recommended video shooting on auto focus",5
This bad camera also it is not supported with triggers and extra flash his given point is not compatible with other brands for beginners if he buy only cannon flash and trigger very costly and photo quality also bad my I phone quality is much more better then this dslr useless camera don’t waste your money I already wasted,1
"Main drawback is that, It does not have 3.5 mm jack for recording audio... A connector to connect its mini usb port to 3.5 mm jack should be in its accessories",5
"I received the product on 4.10.2019. When I tried to register the product with the website of canon to get extended warranty, it is revealed that the product has already been registered on 13.06.2019. So, the warranty would expire on 12.6.2021. It is also revealed that the supplier's name is incorrect, when I entered the details of the supplier on the website of canon, which is the same as shown in the invoice. To net result is that the warranty is reduced by two and a half months. I have reason to believe that it is a used product. The vendor is expected to you answer my doubts",5
"Initially I was looking for Nikon DSLR, but went with Canon 1500D. I must say that I have made the right choice as it works like a charm, looks good and built quality is very good. Best entry level DSLR.",5
Ok but not useful with basic lens provided with it...pictures are look like you are taken with mobile camera ...pic you are thinking of to taken with dslr are only comes with higher lenses you used ...either you go for 50-250 or 70-300 but basic lens 15-55 are useless.,5
"For beginners in the photography world: The 1st thing you should do after buying a camera is understanding the concepts (shutter speed, aperture, ISO, metering etc). For this please go with some youtube videos to learn the basics.
do not ever keep in auto mode and shoot. learn the things and keep in manual modes (P, Tv, Av, M). Even the ISO, do not keep in Auto for ISO. It will introduce more noise in the image.",4
"Very good camera but canon is simply loosing its credebility but making silly changes in the camera to restrict this camera for professional use .

This camera is not suitable for studio photography as canon has removed the the universal pin from the camera hotshoe ..

Shame on canon ...",4
"As expected, the entry level DSLR is best for beginners. Its easy to operate. I got 18-55 lense which is good for all except zoom, only 3x. However, you have to buy a zoom lens for that purpose. Battery is also good. It lasts the whole day with continuous shooting.",5
"As a beginner in photography myself, i was suggested to buy this product by a photographer friend of mine. So far, good to practice your skills on, but definitely would suggest to move on to other better options quickly.

It comes with a kit lense and a kit bag to hold the camera body, lense and batterycharger, but the holding loop of the bag got torn off on the second day !!!... That was a bit dissapointing.",4
Value for money. Good for beginers. I used for video recording. Max record upto 12 min. as per standards. No external mic support to record audio as it's entry level DSLR. I used previously canon 1300D which of 18 MP but it's of 24 MP which is better for photos and videos as well. More durable. Got in deal around 24000 rupee. More than happy.,5
"A perfect camera for beginners. If you are not a professional ,this camera will suffice all your needs.
Good Autofocus
Great picture quality.
And best thing is remote operability from canon camera connect App. This really helps for nature photography.",5
Best camera for beginners and short film makers. Camera is very well packed and it looks awesome. The user manual is very useful for first time buying people. Zoom lens is awesome. And the carrying bag is also very good. I really liked the product and it give me a better experience. Thank you canon and also Amazon 🙏,5
"This camera is very good for beginners. U can go with 1500 or 3000d . But the picture quality and video quality in 1500d is not that mark . Its auto fuces is too bad . If I r vlogger and have less bought pls get your self better mobile , this camera is not for videos. It record videos at 1080p 30 fps . 720p 50 fps . Video samples are quit good and above average. Go with prime lens 18 55mm lens for boke or blue background for u r photos and videos quit better then 3000d . I got this camera 20990 Rs ( sbi debit card 10% off offer )only in great Indian sale",4
We purchased it for a gift. It really was a great deal. The best part is that it was liked by the person whom we gifted. He actually enjoys it now. The photos are sharp and usability is good. Great product and good quality by Amazon.,5
"Very bad experience of service , 45 days for after service delivery, if got the camera after 45 days for I have travel for 150 km , the camera have hanging problem from the month of perchse",3
"I am a beginner. i loved the settings its easy to lean ISO and AF Settings. And i got 55 250 MM lens free with this and teh focus for that lens is awesome.. Also Stability is great. While clicking portrait pics its coming so good. Better then Iphone XR.

Just one thing it makes too much sound thats it otherwise its worth buying....",5
"Nikon 3400 is better than 3500 so don't buy nikon 3500.
But i choose canon 1500 because wifi , camera app,
You definitely need extra lens. 50mm is good because i though kit lens is ok for me but believe me you definitely need extra lens. Zoom lens is not you need so don't buy with combo lens. Go for 50 mm lens. Now one more thing",4
This Camera is worth the money but the Focus is slow and one very bad about this camera is that it doesn't have 3.5mm external mic port connection other wise picture quality with prime lens and zoom lens is awesome.,4
"This is my first CAMERA and its perfect DSL for beginners. Picture quality is awesome. Auto focus is amazing. Still in learning phase but so far I like this product very much. Soon will purchase another lens beyond 50+
Lastly again before time delivery from Amazon.",5
Cannot attach flashgun,1
"Budget DSLR. Photo qualities of flowers are awesome. But normal photography is average equivalent to good quality images of photo captured from most of the mobile phone except pixels.
Clearity is good which can't be available in most of the image captured from mobile ..
there is no in built image effect. So image u will get will be original.
So it can be tried. But if u have budget,I will guggest better to
go for higher version .",5
"Bought this camera for about 23000.The camera was packed pretty well.
The camera is really good for beginners.Some people say the kit lens is bad but I feel you can get some pretty decent shots once you learn how to use it.The auto focus is not that good so I recommend you use the manual focus,just to get your perfect shot.one of the reasons I bought this camera is because of the wifi function.It works really well and it is convenient .",4
"It is best for daylight shoots not perfect for night shoots........... It is used for the beginner because I am also a beginner....

With modeling, you pose. You want to look your best all the time. With acting, you have to be aware of the camera, but the more you show your imperfections, the better you're going to be.",5
"Hey there, I am just a beginner so not going to deep. Definetly as a beginner I feel very comfartable using this camera. Autofocus is enough if you are not shooting moving pictures.If you use in manual mode and keep the perfect settings you will get the best result. For the price this is the best you can expect. And as I said I am a beginner and learning photography. So if I pointed anything wrong please apologize.",5
"No hot shoe
Have attached photos of the same
Huge Flash issue
Don’t buy canon 1500D if you want to use third party flash with this camera as it doesn’t have Center hot shoe.
Third party flash cost less.
As a entry level camera the cost of camera is low.
But You’ll be forced to buy canon flash only as only canon flash are supported and canon flash are expensive.
Go for other canon models which have Center hot shoe.",2
"Perfect to capture every special moments of your life..

No need of expertise, camera adjust itself to capure best photos.. picture quality is awesome..battery works for 3-4hrs after fully charged. wifi function is very useful to download photos in your mobile. overall performance ia good..",5
"Only used photosgraphy
Not for record video autofocus vary bad
No 9 point autofocus only 1 autofocus point",1
Good product For begginers and if you want to good quality picturs you should buy this product . But in case if you want to make video for project so kindely notice that it has verry poor focus and if object still than you can focus properly buy if obect are moving then you'll face problems .otherwise good image quality and and good potrait photos you can capture,4
It's a great camera for biggnier. Only drawback no option for connecting external mic.,4
Have received used item (item has already registered in canon website 2 months before I purchased.. have shared all proofs to amazon team) but customer care people suggesting me to contact manufacturer.. such a worest response have received.. Amazon team took time to respond mean time my return window period also completed..,1
Camera image quality is good. However there's one major disadvantage about canon product is unlike Nikon it only support own brand accessories like external flash which is wayyyy tooooo costly. (~12k). For beginner use it can work good but only in daylight.,3
"Amazing camera. Got it in 27k with 18-55 and 55-250 lens in great india sale. Easy to handle all functions and picture quality is awsum. Easy to adjust aperture, shutter speed and ISO in manual setting. Auto setting works well. Light weight. Very good start for beginers. Go for it.",5
"Its not at all user friendly. For every click you need to set the lense .Pics get blurred. There is no one to help or support.
Helpline no is not responding. I tried to register the product but couldnt do till date.
Canon has third class products and services",1
"This is a very suitable, easy to handle DSLR camera for people who want to start out with digital photography. I was able to operate this camera very easily after learning different functionalities by watching several videos online. Strongly recommended for people with no or very little exposure to DSLR. One can always choose to buy a better lens later if they feel like upgrading the quality of the pictures.",5
Enjoying with it. Easy to operate. But you have fixed ISOs. Not working with camera connect app on my Samsung phone. If you neglect this than it is good for beginners. Four stars.,4
"The Canon 1500D is an excellent package for begineers. The controls are amazing and easy to use. The images are crisp and clear. The autofocus is also great.
The only con i noticed in this product is that when we are in screen display mode for capturing images the auto focus take a lot of time to focus on the subject.
Otherwise overallthe product is worth every penny.
Thanks to Amazon for ontime delivery and great package.",5
"Best camera for photography, but its not good if you wanna shoot video B'cqz auto focus not working as well as during video shoot!

I had suggest you to buy a prime lens for batter portraits and low light photos!

@nofeel_shaikh",3
If you want to buy a dslr under 30k then this is probably the best choice for you.....even a good hand is enough to click pictures like professionals with this dslr....just make sure you buy a portrait lens when u buy the first extra lens with this camera....this combination of 50mm lens and canon 1500D is a beast🔥,5
"Amazing build quality. Best camera for beginners and also for mediocre users. I belive anyone who knows basic rules of photography should buy this, you will have an amazing time with this camera, the canon mobile app also helps with the remote capture. Autofocus could have been better for subject which are really close but never the less its the best entry level camera in the world",5
"Highly disappointed with the problems I'm facing with the camera, the flash of the camera stops working and start showing error 50. Restarted many times but the problem remained same.",1
Very MC Product Bill is not available on this Box 😡 and memory card and battery and 55-250mm lens both are not available on this product ☹️ 😒 DON'T BUY AMAZON IS FROD,1
"I'm very excited to get soon ,as I expected I received soon,TNX to Amazon fr fast n safe delivery , Amazon is most trusted fr safe n geniune products 😍🥰😘",5
The camera is great for beginners who have just stated to learn but the features are slightly complex for understanding. If you have ever used a Nikon camera..I would suggest you buy Nikon because the transition can be little uneasy. But the camera in itself is very good. I have used this camera in limited scenarios but experienced so far is great.,4
"This is perfect for a beginner. Very affordable, handy,amazing picture clarity. Got charger, sd card and carry bag free with the camera.",5
"I ordered Canon EOS 1500D from Amazon and guess what, there is a missing Camera bag and merory card in the box. And box was sealed properly when I got in my hand",1
"It's my first camera and the quality is very good and also the packing.
Easy to use but bit difficult to understand settings
Overall it can be said that it's mind-blowing ♥️",5
As b begineer i used CANON 1500D but it gave me satisfactory results. In day light shooting it's awesome . Some how while using falsh u have to steady ur hands for better result . Neither u will get some shakeey pictures. For better shots day light preferable. I am using its kit lens 18-55mm and those images are aslo taken from this lense..,5
"Bought it for 19000 rs with free earphone worth 999.....its a great camera for beginners and i liked the idea of nfc, wifi transfer.... Too good.... Its a great deal",5
"Got a great deal on Amazon and ordered it.
Great camera for first time users.
At first was confused between Nikon D3500 and Canon 1500D but after receiving the camera and using it for the very first time felt very comfortable how easy and user friendly it was even for an amature like me.
Great camera and simple the best in it's category.",5
I use it mainly for print photography and it is very easy to use and captures very accurate images. I am more than happy with the purchase and at current price it is excellent value for money.,5
"Go for it if u get a good deal
Pros
1 cannon best lenses support
2 WiFi connectivity for sharing
3 ease of use
Cons
1 not as user friendly as 34/3500 D
2 bulky",5
I recently bought this camera night mode pics are really coming blurr and shaky.pickels also not clear only in night mode.pls help me to find the right mode or replace this one because I think it's a problem. After my purchase price went down to 21000 which is highly disappointing,1
It's a good night have to choose for beginners and it is very nice use package was very safe and because of a good 19 impact it was late delivery. Camera is very useful to beginners like me. And well set about the building quality quality is very nice CE and pretty good to view good to see that also. The image taken by the camera is very clear and it is a budget camera for beginners,5
This is a great camera for not only beginners but also amateur photographers. Often what matters is how well you know your camera and since this is a user-friendly camera it is worth considering!,5
Great product and great service by the seller. The seller has helped me out to resolve a glitch I had and I am really grateful to him. The seller followed up and made sure that I had a good experience with the transaction I made with him,5
"This is the best Camera for Beginners. You can learn Manual Mode easily, UI is good and user friendly. Search for videos on YouTube to get best out of it.",4
"I received the product in very good condition and the product is excellent for beginners. If you know the use of different lens, the camera is awesome. If the the lens cost are bi lower side, we may buy different lens to explore more.

One can buy this product form Amazon as I have purchased many products which I have received in good condition.

All the best",5
My first DSLR loving it.... but don't underestimate this camera it gonna wow you if used correct lens,5
Amazing product. Got at 21490. Great buy at this price. First DSLR ever. Fully satisfied.,5
"Good camera. Very easy to handle for a beginner. With a good lens, it would juz do wonders for the price range. I have used basic Nikon also, but never felt this easy.",5
"Well i found the product authentic after buying it from amazon, entry level 📷, for photography enthusiasts good product for starters. I bought the camera in very reasonable price (great India shopping).",5
Too good picture quality. For beginners it is so good. If u want to purchase a digi cam and don't want much money ot be invest you can go for it.,5
I brought this camera without telephoto lens because I believe I won't click nature portraits. I believr buying canon 50mm lens will do magic. Using aperture priority mode now and learning to use. Will post review after a month.,4
I purchased at 15300 rs it's very useful camera go for it at this price,5
Nice camera for dslr beginner's,5
"I was waiting for this one.. Since a long time.. When the 1200D model was popular.. Then 1300D.. But i waited too long to own this camera.. Finally i got 1500D by amazon with a great offer @28k..

U ll get 2 lenses and a carry case and all that u want.. U can simple start photography..",5
"Pros-Best for beginners. Best deal worth 19,950 with EF-S 18-55 lense+ focal earphones worth 1999 MRP with this deal.
Cons- it support onlt Cannon external flash which is a costly product. Other cameras supports other make flashes starting ₹2500",5
Wow really love this gadget just wana say that its totally worth it the capturing level of camera is too good really enjoyed a single function it’s probably works beyond expectations and for professional iss too good to start up with i have no confession about it and sure recommend to others,5
very nice dslr camera with good quality picfures and very good video quality. i recomend everyone to buy this dslr camera.,5
"Perfect for beginners. I would advise it, got lucky during the sale. Got a good bargain deal on the camera and 1 lense. bag + 16 gig memory card. Product is friendly to use and easy to maintain.",5
The best DSLR at the starting price range. It has just the right amount of settings for beginners to learn the perks of a DSLR. The video and snaps quality is also too good.,5
"If you are a beginner go for it .The auto focus is just fine, speaking about picture quality the 24 mp works fine even in low light",5
Actually the Camera Bag is given here in the Box is not for the Model EOS1500D. And the Bag is not fit at all for the purchased Model. My point is to change the Bag. Other wise I will think for return of the Product. Supply of Original Bag for this particular Bag should be there. Just replace the Bag with the return period.,3
If you are going with this camera then fine but you can't use third party additional flash light you have to bought canon flash which is costing more than 20000 so I prefer if you want to use it with additional so don't buy it otherwise for normal purpose at-home it is fine,3
"Who want learn photo shoot, YouTube video shooting, very useful and low price camera, good branded model and company product.. thank you Amazon",5
"Product quality is good.......as per photo shown in Amazon and company.....
Works better... Totally genuine sealed item received...thnks amajon....",4
"There is no invoice for the Canon Camera , either with the box or under My Orders in Amazon App. So I cannot warranty for product - how can I buy electronics from Amazon ?",4
"It's more suitable DSLR camera for beginners. It's got great auto focus and couple of modes for varied kind of shots. Also it has benefit of wireless picture snapping via NFC/Mobile app, which can also live view the picture taken and transfer the pictures/videos on the go.",4
This is my first DSLR. Canon EOS 1500D has proved itself with its awesome picture quality and a better battery life. Loved it to the core. Best Budget DSLR. Worth Money. Thanks Canon India.😊😍😘📷📷,5
This is a very good product for beginners at this price. I got this for 22k in amazon when there was a one day deal. It is so far so good. Excellent product if would just like to use it for small family parties and gatherings.,4
"Hello
This camera is v good for beginners and lots to learn to shoot at first sight and picture quality is at satisfaction level, not bad at all.For anyone to Buy decent DSLR at low price with quite good spec and good pictures to focus on ,consider to be one of your choice .",4
This camera named canon 1500D I bought from amazon is completely a basic level camera. It has overall every features a beginner needs and 2ndly it has guide with it which is very much helpful for beginners in every steps .,5
Attached snapshots taken from Canon 1500D,5
The package reached me safe with good packing. It is an original product. It came with bill and warranty card.. Nice product.. A very good camera in this price range for beginners. The picture quality is fine. If this is your first DSLR you can blindly choose this.,5
"it's a very good camera for beginners.photo quality is really good. at first i didn't get memory card with it but amazon replaces it without any hassle so point goes to amazon also. now i am pretty much satisfied with this.
thank you.",5
"Being a beginner myself, the camera is an excellent option for those who are just stepping into the creative art of photography as it can give them all the tools needed to harness their skills.",5
"Just best in class..
Can't compare this one from others.
A must buy for beginners.
Obviously better than 1300d.",5
Great DsLR for beginners !,5
"No digital memory card with the purchase, even thou it was enlisted. Too costly.",2
Awsome product i get it for 22000 in great Indian festival sale with one year extra waranty.the photos are awesome for a beginner its the best in the market go for it,5
"Really good DSLR for beginners
Only downside is the Canon app which doesn't help in transferring videos wirelessly",4
Good product to start your hobby or to explore your photography skills in style loaded with cool features.Got it during sale and value for money.,4
"Very good for beginners
Autofocus is not very good as it has only 9 af points
The screen is also not moveable
Compact and user friendly
Lightweight
The raw file is in CR2 format which is not easy to open and edit in simple software
Nikon D5600 is also in the same line you can buy but has less megapixel, but high af points and moveable screen",5
"External flash is not working in this model, i tried simpex, digitek....etc",2
This camera is great for beginners. The default lens is good for initial practice but this camera will work best with lens having focalength greater than 50 mm. Overall nice product to begin with in the field of photography.,4
First dslr.. Extremely happy with the purchase...! Cheap and best...! Got it at 19k in an offer..!,5
"A budget friendly Camera for beginners.📸
I bought this for 19k💰
It's doesn't disappointing me😊
A Great Camera for learning photography.👨‍🏫
You want to learn photography then go for it.
Great Picture Quality at this price range🖼",5
Auto mode is really nice except for flash but I bought it for 24k so in this price just go for it,4
"Product is awesome. Picture Quality is great with 24mp camera.
if u want more background blur then uneed to purchase the canon 55m f/1.8 stm lens, connect with this camera and enjoy it.",4
Excellent camera for beginner and very handy during our Australia tour,5
Picture quality is too good... Being an amateur i like how easy it is to use... Still a lot to learn... Battery life is good as well... Charge once to the fullest and came back from a three day trip to shillong... And it is still going on,5
This is exclusively for beginners. Pictures are clear on the day light compares to indoor pics. This is not at all recommended for nature photographers.,3
"Good camera for beginners, picture and video quality is good , I am using it for making youtube videos. Very good product at this low cost.",5
"The camera is perfect for an amateur photographer. The auto focusing is smooth and of quality. The body is lite as well which helps in taking quality pictures. The controls are a bit confusing, especially the menu. However, an enthusiastic person will be able to figure the controls out pretty easily. All in all, it's a fabulous product",5
"Everything is Good But You should buy without any lens and get the new model STM Lens which has Digital Focus..Avoid IS ii Lens which comes with these model..

Autofocus missed in Videomode..so it's not suitable for Gimbels",5
Amazing product. I get appreciation for every picture I take and all of it should go to the camera. Beginners like me can use this with absolute ease. Photo transfer to photo or laptop is made so simple that it can happen in few minutes... Excellent product.,5
Just don't expect very fast af from this one (which I did). The camera is a good one but the lenses make some noise while autofocusing and sometimes you'd prefer to use the manual focus. This 1500d is absolutely not for shooting videos. Picture quality is average. I bought it with the 50mm and it's okay. Anyways it's gud for beginners. Attached some pics I clicked of and a portrait of my friend.,4
It's easy to know about all setting... I also don't know about photography and how to use camera but still in 4 to 5 days i learn mainly every thing from this camera... It's very helpful for beginners and their autofocus or picture quality was so nice.... But some time in manual mode it create more time to click a picture.,5
Nice,5
"this is my first dslr and im very happy for having it.
it comes with enough features which every beginner needs.
but 1 thing to dislike is it does not support any local external flash gun...like sonia digitek..godox.........only canon's original flashgun works with it. which is worth 16k....",5
Not good for beginners as well as professional users. price is too high for the picture quality that this camera gives. Nikon 3500D gives great photos with blur in the background and is also best in this price range.,2
"best priced DSLR in while lot. go for it. tough i am not much into photography and bought this for personal use only, its very compatible for all kind of photography as far as i know. 5 star for pricing.",5
It looks like higher end dslr feels good in hands and i love canon. Picture quality is very good more then my expectation. In low light also it performs well i like canon 1500d 😍.,5
"Amazing Photos for beginners photography.
Nice features.
Light weight.
1300D is also a Good Option.",4
"Very good quality photos getting from 24.1px, really good start for beginners. Easy to handle, wifi is advantages. Price is little bit high.",5
Good camera . Have good picture quality . Best photo experience,5
"Perfect beginner level dslr, met its pixel quality. I have used it for an year now and its the best if you are new to dslr's. Good battery, best lens and top camera. The body's is a bit heavy,but best at this price.",5
Good for learning photography. Go through the online video tutorials for photography. Canon settings are minimal and easy to understand the basic concepts of photography. Most professional photographers use Canon. Canon 1500D will be the top notch for entry level DSLR.,5
Not Good For Begineers. Not able to autofocus while shooting videos. the picture quality is just okay. Nikon point & sooot camera is better than this.,1
I think this is best product for beginners. Great shoot captured yet. Some samples attached. For further shoots u can follow me on Instagram © IamHemantSoni,5

Nice one😎 canon 1300 d and 1500d are the best cameras for beginners available now at market. Compared to Sony and Nikon it’s simple and not much confusing (for beginners ),5
"Got it at only rs18990. Camera is very good with some minor flaws.
Pros

Easy transfer through wifi.
Good build quality.

Cons :
Autofocus is slow.
Lowlight images are not upto the mark.
Not suitable for video.",4
I just loved it 😍......!!!. It's a great camera for a beginner. At this price range. I attached some samples images. All images are taken using 18-55mm kit lens.,5
"Don't buy any item from Amazon.
It's is fraud. I receive short item. They have no solution for that. Bill amount not match with my order in bill invoice. Over DSLR camera is good.",1

5) weight
BAD:
1) picture quality is ok not much good",4
"Unbelievable picture quality for the price, just become familiar with the camera once you are set you might have to adjust shutter speeds for low light but all in all great for beginners, but if you are getting it for blogging or YouTube spend 12k extra and get 200d it will be more apt for you and it also has dual pixel auto focus for fast moving objects",5
Seal was already open and the price of the product drastically decreased in one day after my purchase and one of the lens is not working properly and i am not happy with the seller... Guys don't go for it...... Seller is not genuine... Product seal was already opened....,1

3)Nice Built Built quality
4)worth for money
5) Only one this is disappointing is that carry is not in good quality",5
How can u send a product which is already registered 6 months back? How can someone register without opening the product. This means it's used waste product right,1
"Initially I thought it would give above average images but it's awesome. Just need to put some good values in settings and the out put will blow our mind. Though this is my first DSLR cam after 18 years gap from film Cam's, there is more I need to work on this.",5
Outstanding DSLR camera for beginners I bought it for my sister under₹19000 and she's loving it.,5
Best Camera you can buy in this budget. Especially for beginners.,5
"No data transfer cable is available.
No alternate battery is available.
Full charge battery duration is not more than 2 hrs.
Image quality is poor when there is no charge in battery.",2
"Autofocus of kit lens isn't enough for Macro photography.
However the performance is awsome if one is well versed with Manual settings",5

I got this camera in unsealed packing...it seems someone tried to open it...I didn't expect this type of packing of an expensive thing,4
For tech illiterates like me please write in bold that this camera cannot record sound and neither can an external mike be used in this model. Please don't buy this camera if you intend to record videos.,1

Iphone camera is better than this dslr please go with nikon . Sharpness and colors are far better in nikon .,3

Amazing camera for one who is looking for an extraordinary camera on this price range. It comes with two different lenses which r insane. Picture quality is just off the charts.,5
Got it at 18990/- only during the great india n sale. Picture quality is great. Battery backup is about to take 500 shots. Flash is just ok. Not a sharp one. Very handy and easy to use. If you want to buy then buy with dual lense because 2nd lense is about 12 to 14k. In dual kit you get 2nd lense at 8 to 9k,5
VERY GOOD CAMERA AT THE PRICE RANGE.,5
"DSLR 1500D is perfact for beginners, best quality pictures. Easy to use, using wifi communication u can easily transfer all the images in your phone, also u can use ur phone as remote control of your DSLR with a small android app canon camera connect.",5
"After gaining a bit of knowledge of Manual control and AV, TV modes, I am very satisfied with the camera. Highly recommended for beginners searching for entry level DSLRs.",5
box was resealed with tape. original canon tape was already torn. i am not sure if i got fresh piece.,3
Not sure how but got a steal deal at 32995! Camera build is great and surprisingly there is also a pouch included.,5
"Very Nice At This Price... I Got It At Low Price During Great Indian Festival... With Dual Lens... It's Perfect For The Beginners... I Wanna Give Thanks To The Seller... ""Appario Retail Limited"" Got It Before Our Festival Durga Puja... Battery Life Is Not So Nice... But, Good...",5
This product is best for beginners who want to come to the world of photography. I am using this camera for 2 days i am pretty satisfied with the experience and i didnt get any issues if i get some issues after using it i will be updating this revew. the lens which u getwith this camera is 18-55mm kit lens which gives descent depth of field the only problem with lens is that it can only zoom uptp 55mm long so if u want a high end lens u can buy it seperately. i have attached a picture of mine which was shot by my brother so that u can get an idea of the picture quality. overall this is one of the cheapest but best camera i have ever seen.,5
"Good morning sir
this is Mir Muzaffar Gani a resident of Kashmir India . 9 days ago i ordered a dslr camera model canon1500d of Rs 38990 but company send me used and faulted charger and battery . I continously charged my battery for 3 hours but even a single cell is not charged. i afraid may b the camera is also used.
plz help me in this regard

"The canon 1500d is a budget DSLR from canon and on paper, it looks great.

Let me explain to you if this is a great option for you or the best one out there.

What is surprising is the camera supports the same sensor found on the canon 80d and canon sl2.

The 3000d is very similar to this and you would be hard pressed to find a lot of changes on this.

It can capture HD video and it has a 9 point autofocus system

The battery life is good at approximately 500 shots.

It has a very nice UI and is extremely easy to use, the camera has some modes for beginners which allows beginners to get better control of the camera.

WiFi NFC also adds important features which improve the sharing features for the mobile application which allows you to get a better connection of your camera from your mobile device.

The device has good build quality but does not have a premium feel to it as most of the parts are plastic to keep costs in check.

I have been very impressed by canon camera in the past and there are few which I have not recommended people to buy as a Camera reviewer, this has to be one of those few, let me explain you why.

This is my all-time favorite camera at this price, which you need to check out, before buying let me explain why it is a smart choice to get it.

check it out

https://amzn.to/2mx5MuG

The camera that I have mentioned above from Nikon has an articulating screen, which is great for bloggers and people who would like to shoot pictures or videos in tight spaces.

The Max ISO is higher on the Nikon and it has a larger screen which also has better Screen resolution, with built-in time-lapse recording and higher Sensor pixel area, it has better output and still comes with a brilliant battery.

if you are looking for something from the house of Canon you can also check this one out, the same camera with a different kit.

https://amzn.to/2LExAbr

Think about it this way, if you are getting this as your first camera, I would recommend you to look for other options out there, and if you are looking for a spare camera which is compact and easy to carry around, you can still go for this one.

You would be happy with the camera, but with time you will end up upgrading from this very soon.

pros

1.great sensor offered by Canon
2.good build
3.good connectivity options
4.well priced for what it offers

Cons

1. Not a great performer
2. Simply lacks features, which the competition provides
3. Plastic build all around
4. Video and image quality not quite there

Thank you so much for reading my review, I hope it was helpful to you, if it did help you, click the helpful button at the bottom.

Have a great day ahead.",3
Its a Good Camera With A 18-55mm lens and a 16GB memory card it is better than most of the DLSR. I Just Love This Cam. Its light weight and easy to carry and most of all the pic are damm😍,5

"Photos are delightful to watch as DSLR has its own charm. Also as it can be synced with your mobile phone via canon camera connection app, it gives immediate access to the photos on your mobile with automatic size adjustment. If you are looking for an entry level DSLR, you can bet on this product. Still exploring various other features, Amazon packing! Well amazing as usual!",5
"Befor great indian festival sale started (befor 02-nov-2018) prize of this camera is 25,990 now after sale started price is 27,990 & giving 10% (max 1500) discount on hdfc credit card. so after discount price is 26,490. after amazon pay 1000 discount still price is same as befor. is there really any meaning of great indian festival sale.....

Camera is definitally very good.",1
"Hello everybody
I'm giving this review after 6months of use

One thing I must say is that this camera is perfect for learners and beginners
And the picture quality and photography totally depends on the photographer... And not on the camera..... If u don't know in what settings u need to click the desired image..... U will never get the perfect shot.

Things I LIKED:
>well built quality
>durable
>clicks high end clarity pictures because of its 24.1mp sensor
>easy handy settings and controllers
>good battery capacity
>for non manual too photography.... It's best
Things I not LIKED:
>zoom lens doesn't come with EIS
>lens focusing sound can be disturbing sometimes",5
The seal has been tampered. And i think it was completely opened before I got my order,1
just before my honeymoon ordered this it did not have additional lens and guess what the replaced product did not have the required lens either 0 stars!!!,1
"As a beginner I really liked this camera, I used Nikon 3300 before, but this one is simple awesome. Got it in a deal and delivery was just outstanding received in <24 hrs without prime.",5
"Fortunately we got a steal deal..extra star for that 😀. Camera is good.. It's the enhanced version of 1300 d with better picture quality and superb colour outputs. Still exploring the features though and since like the camera I am too a beginner..we'll take some time to understand each other. So far so good. For now I can comment on the packaging
It comes with 2 lenses as already communicated in the features, Battery and charger. Also camera bag quality is superb. Thanks Amazon for fast service and superb deal. Will share thefeedback on performance after usage of some time",5
"If you are looking for a quality camera, then this is not it. Only for that ""DSLR"" tag.
Pros :
1. Good Battery backup.
2. DSLR so can fit another lens.
3. Many camera controls.
4. Affordable price.

Cons :
1. Camera quality is far behind other DSLRs and Mirroress ones.
2. A Smartphone of the same price takes better Photos in most of the times. (Galaxy S9, Realme X2 Pro etc..)
3. Shoots only at 1080p30 where the above phones do 4K60p
4. Video quality is just acceptable and very low stabilization if any with the included lens.
5. Not that great in low light.
6. Loud mirror noises ( Better to go with a mirrorless ).

For a casual photographer, it is Okay. But coming to videos, cheaper point and shoots like Nikon A900, Sony RX100 etc.. record 4K30p and 1080p60p respectively.
I've tested RX100 and 1500D side by side and most of the time and almost in low light, Small Sony RX100 outperformed Canon 1500D.

Only for photographers, and also if you are beginner and willing to buy prime lens just after buying this camera.",1
"Not at all recommended to anyone! Personal opinion based on 2 months of usage.
DO NOT BUY ANY CANON 1200/1300/1500/3000 whatever crap.

There a few good things to appreciate on paper but when it cones to practically, it makes you regret your decision. I'm not opposing canon in any way. I have been shooting with Canons for like 6 years professionally now, just recently switched to EOS R from EOS80D but hell no, this whole line-up from canon is bull***t. Not even recommended to beginners. Its better to learn on some friend's DSLR than to buy this piece of disgusting gadget.

1. For learning purpose- borrow from a friend, or watch youtube, tonnes of content. Don't waste your money here. (I'll justify my hate just in a few mins.)
2. For basic family use- Better buy a point and shoot at a way less price.

I ordered it for my neighbours' son to teach him photography but we ended up selling it away in not more than 2 months!! Good decision.

The only useful feature? Interchangeable Canon EF/s lenses and 1080p at 24 fps.

Crap list?
1. misses focus 95/100 times even on slower aperture like f8-f11. very less detailed shots. You CANNOT focus and recompose (the only option as just 9 point focus) even on F8 or F11, the image is just soft, blurry all over and tinted (with kit 18-55 or 55-250) sharpness comes a bit improved upon spending 8k more for a basic prime lens 50mm 1.8 EF.
2. Sensor is pathetic! grainy (noise) even on ISO 100! (the lower the ISo, the more sharp picture comes without grains &ISO 100 is minimum here!) I have no idea why. Seriously Canon?
3. Auto-Focus is not good. I don't use auto focis but since its targeted towards beginners, autofocus needs to be spot on.

overall, not what you expect of a DSLR
so what to do?
my opinions
1. either save a bit more and start off with a canon 200D ATLEAST! or crank up that budget to get an M50 (bang for the buck!!)
2. learn on a rented/borrowed camera.
3. For family guys, get a point and shoot. Sony makes good point and shoots. Cz either way you ain't gonna be using manual controls.

in short- Retarded Product from a very trusted brand. Don't waste your hard earned money or beginner capital.",1
"Packaging could be improved. Outer Amazon box was tampered. Though other aspects were okay, these small things make the difference. Awesome camera. Loved it",4
Good camera,4
An excellent entry level dslr to begin with if you are interested in photography..,5
"I am using 700D for professional portfolio shoots. The main problem is these are not full frame cameras and hence they restrict me to get a proper output.

4K recording is missing. So, if I have to create a video collage with the portfolio image shoot. Editing Full HD video lost its quality in pinnacle.",3
"You might not see a verified review because I bought it from a friend's Amazon account. I got the 1500D after comparing with 3000D and Nikon 350D. This is a great choice for beginner to intermediate photography lovers. Modes are easy to operate. Has dedicated features for food, video, travel and portrait modes. Comes in a beautiful premium camera bag, a 16gb memory card plus a 15-55mm lens. Flash is inbuilt and pops up when u click the flash button. Focus is clear and it has wifi facility. You can pick up the photos from the phone directly from the camera through connecting in the same WiFi network and that's an awesome feature. Highly recommend this. I got it for 20990-2000 card discount and that's a steal at this price. As a travel blogger this Will come in very handy for my photographs though I still need time to master it. Definitely get one of this and take your photography to the next level.",5
I want my bill of this product on my mail id plz provide me it's babita721192@gmail.com,3
"Canon 1500 is the best entry level DSLR and its very easy and convenient to use. The canon connect app is jst superb. You dnt have to worry abt transfering the pics from the memory card..jst connect the DSLR through its inbuilt wifi to ur smartphone and jst view or download any pic..save it in ur phone, laptop. You can also view and click from ur smartphone. This is the best function of the camera..the DSLR works well even in low light..i have tried clicking pics without using flash..and they came out superb..images are crisp and there is no issue of the pixelisation..day time images are superb no doubt.
Superb for beginners. That can learn easily from this camera.
Picture quality is good as compared to others, but still it can get improve.

Features

Beautiful, high-resolution images with the 24.1 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor & DIGIC 4+ image processor
The large 24.1-megapixel APS-C size CMOS sensor, on par with those on Canon’s DSLRs for advanced users, captures abundant light information, which is processed by the fast DIGIC 4+ image processor to produce high-quality images with beautiful color gradations. Even shots taken in low-light at a high ISO speed are clear with minimal noise. The large sensor size also contributes to the ability to achieve the shallow depth-of-field necessary for creating images with smooth background blur.

A myriad of possibilities for creative expression
Users can choose their favorite style of shooting: Through the optical viewfinder, which has quick, precise viewfinder AF; or in Live View mode on the large, 3.0-inch LCD screen to easily fine-tune composition and framing. In addition to 5 Creative filter effects, the 'Shoot by ambience' selection provides another way to create images with the mood and feel that you envision.

Wi-Fi / NFC-Easy pairing with smartphones, printers and other devices
Pair your camera and smartphone via Wi-Fi / NFC and the Camera Connect App, and you can easily use your smartphone to browse, save and upload your camera images to social media, or to carry out remote shooting-great for self-portraits and group photos. You can also wirelessly transfer files to printers and other cameras through direct pairing, or to TV sets via the Connect Station CS100.

I just love it,5
"This is an excellent entry level camera. One can polish their skills of photography before looking at higher models. There is no need go for an expensive DSLR and not having the skills to use it. I am using this camera for some time now and learning the best possible way to take pics in any light.
Highly recommended for the initial passion of photography which will bite you. Once you use this camera and want to pursue more then you can look at more expensive cameras. By that time you will know which camera is suitable for you and which photography is your forte. Accordingly you will buy the correct lenses, be it prime lenses, zoom lenses or you want to use only the kit lenses only.
BTW the lenses are more important for your photography.",5
"Canon and Nikon have been the leaders in the camera space they have a lot of models to offer and it is always confusing to pick the right one.

Today I am going to compare the best selling canon 1500 d to the nikon model mentioned below.

Check the link
https://amzn.to/2TBTvUJ

A different kit
https://amzn.to/2UQD8DP

When you compare the 3500 available at the same price the canon simply feels dated, the Nikon has better battery, the difference is not marginal, the battery on the Nikon feels much superior, the maximum iso is also higher and with a large pixel area, I feel the comparison simply feels one sided.

With bluetooth and phone control the Nikon is a much better deal
Both the cameras lack an articulating screen which is sad considering how useful it is for Vloggers.

Design and build

The level of quality is impressive from the Japanese brand. Everything feels well built and the buttons have a tactile feel to them. With a decent display, well laid out buttons and compact body this one feels very practical to use.

This does not feel super premium, but it isn't supposed to feel like high end cameras to keep costs in check .

Performance and image quality

This is what got me a little disappointed, don't get me wrong this is an absolutely fantastic camera in isolation, it offers great image quality, low light performance and decent performance, but when you put it against the competition it feels a bit dated.

Conclusion

A good camera, but not my recommendation at this price point. If you want a camera only from the house of canon check this one out.

My recommended canon 1500d kit available at a very good deal, discounted price.

https://amzn.to/2UQDhHn

Thank you for reading my review.

Hope it helps

Good day!",3
Awesome product,5
"This is best in the segment. I bought it during Amazon Great Indian Sale at RS 20000 after bank discounts (Amazon price during sale was 21500). At this price range, no need to think twice before buying. However, the IS lens 18-55 that comes with it is of no use. Should buy 50mm STM lens and 58-250mm STM lens too. Those lenses with this cam will give you amazingly incredible photos. Buy the cam and lens during special sale seasons, preferably on the first day of the season, as prices later tend to go up.",5
Nice dslr for beginners,5
first of all benefited as prime member in this purchase..it's very easy to use and image quality is good..bag is also of good material and quality..it has WiFi option by which pics can easily be taken to mobile phone..no need to wait till days we get access to laptop or computer..I go for 18-55 mm lens which is enough for normal photography..happy with this purchase..,5
Nice product..my first DSLR n it is great..,5
"Never buy electronic item online and from this seller-Appario retail, although there rating is high but i guess they deliberately do fudge with 10-15% of there sale to manage profit. I bought a Canon DSLR, first the camera charger and better is faulty and it is not charging at all, God know camera will work or not because I am not even able to switch it on. I was travelling so cud not check it once it was delivered. Extremely bad experience and lesson to me me never buy a costly items fro. Amazon or online.",1
Great camera and it's Functions... I have used for 2months and writing this review.. instead of 18MP Can go for this 24MP. Just Loved it..!,5
"Canon has introduced an entry-level DSLR with a 24.1MP sensor alongside connectivity features such as Wi-Fi and NFC.

An unapologetically simple beginner-level DSLR.

2017-2018 has been the year of the smartphone. Not only design, display and battery, but more of a cold war on the photography front. Smartphone manufacturers all out to show their prowess with the cameras on their devices. Be it the primary or the selfie cameras, the smartphone today is completely bridging the gap between a professional camera and a smartphone. However, what a DSLR can procure, a smartphone simply still cannot. DSLR cameras are still the king when it comes to image quality. Moreover, when you need to take complete control over your frame and the light you capture, no smartphone has yet managed to come close to the performance that DSLRs can offer. While smartphones can replace point and shoot cameras to an extent, they are soon closing into the DSLR category, but that will take a few more years to come.

Professional photographers still use the mighty old DSLR for their work. While they do use smartphones to capture a few shots, the photos cannot be worked on due to limitations of file format (JPG) as RAW images are the ones helps in editing. Hence the DSLR, together with the various lenses, are still here to stay.

While it is definitely a difficult job for camera manufacturers is to sell their products in a market that is soon being dominated by smartphone cameras, brands such as Canon, Sony, Nikon and a few others have established their name in the market and offer products that are aimed at different audiences, different budgets, and different photography skill sets.

This year, Canon announced the EOS 1500D and the EOS 3000D, both entry-level cameras, with almost similar features aimed at budding photographers who want to enter into the photography game for a more serious form of the art, rather than use their smartphones that offer very limited capabilities.

The Canon EOS 1500D replaces the dated EOS 1300D that was released back in 2016. This time, it comes with features such as a 24MP APS-C sized CMOS sensor capable of full HD video recording, burst shooting at 3fps, 9-point AF system and Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity. We put the Canon EOS 1500D to the test so that we can give you our recommendation.",5
"one of the best product in this price, great for students and armatures who are starting off with photography.
the SD card was missing for my package, however Amazon was quick to send me that as soon as the complaint was registered.
easy to operate and handle, It also comes with a basic carriage bad which is decent and makes it easy to carry around.",4
"Its a steal deal at 17990 during great indian sale october 2018 . The major cons are
1. Focus motor sound
2. Bad auto focus in low light
3. Very less auto focus points
4. Unnessary flash blinking during focussing a subject
5. Not recommended for videos due to auto focus problem
Pros
1. Built in wifi nfc
2. Very easy to use...compared to Nikon
3. Good battery life of 500 shots
4. Light weight body
5. Great quality bag
6. Best for students and beginners

Only if ur requirement is professional then go with d3400 or u can easily go with 1500d.",5

"Excellent beginner DSLR...
Very easy to use the different modes.
Purchased it in Great Indian Festival sale for Re. 21990.
Product got delivered within 4 days.
Thank you Amazon...",5
The same product i bought from local market Rs. 39999/- . I confuse Amozne price for ebmveything . I think I will buy something from Amazone ..... But i bought from local dealers . because i have extra benifit from local dealer. I suggest to you online buyer 1st study in local market and than use to purchase online or digital market .,5
"Super camera,beginners bust,picture quality super",5
"I got it on the next day. Awesome product. Everything is good.
Easy to handle, picture quality is very good. Good for your learning phase.",5
"Little difficult to handle various functions in beginning but gets adjusted. Picture quality is excellent, 5x optical zoom, no match with any high end mobile picture quality. Panorama picture and slow motion video recording not available.",4
"Not worth of 25 K, The price was never reduced for Amazon big Sale, just to fool consumers, Amazon is just clearing their stocks unsold. It's worth spending he money on a latest version.",2
This is best camera for beginners. I love this camera so much. If you have passion about photography and looking for affordable camera just go for it. Thank you Amazon for this camera and thank you canon also...,5
Image qualyis very good the 50-250mm lens is very good. If u are doing a macro photography or a portrait photography u have to buy a canon 55mm f1.8 lens for more blur effect. Over the package is very good for bignners m also a beginner and m totally satisfied. I had buyed from Reliance Digital Store. U can also buy the product from Amazon. It trustable and good.,5
Very good camera..Very useful..It's very good in picture quality..it's 24.2 megapixels is better than 48 megapixel of mobile camera..Rather than buying a 20K mobile I bought this camera..for 21K..I know I will never regret this decision..And same for you..Many of the mobile cameras failed to match the quality of this camera..Not even match half quality of this camera..,5
If you are thinking of using this camera with a third party manual flash you will be disappointed because Canon has done away with the contact point in the hotshoe which triggers the flash..,2
"This is the best camera for the beginners
1.Easy to Use.
2.Good pic Clarity.
3.Best image processor.
4.Good Range of Compatible lenses.
5.Connectivity is best with Wifi/NFC so copying photos is super fast.
6.Lightweight.
I am impressed with the camera",5
"The only reason to give this item a low star rating is that this camera isn't compatible with most of the third party external falshes current in the market.
If you need external flash for studio Photography you need to buy a specific flash or canons own flash, which is pretty expensive.
The same problem is with the the Canon 300d.",1
"If we pair it with 50mm F1.8 Prime lens, its even greater, love it.
Some important apps u can use :
Canon Camera Connect, Lightroom, Lens distortion (LD app) , Snapseed",5
Got it for 17k from amazon offer .. best cam for trip and small events used more than a year,5
"Good for amateurs....start with this...the included kit has got all the lenses a beginner would need to learn the ropes...too bad you will feel the need to upgrade within a year...so I wouldn't recommend this for aspiring photographers..for a slightly higher mrp, rather go for nikon 5000 series or canon T7i",3
Low light is a disasters. In good lighting its give appreciable result. still need processing to get nice images.sometimes gives fake colors.go fo nikon.,3
"Best dslr for really beginners if u are new in photography you should definitely grab this very simple to use brilliant photos

This Product have no warranty ....a big problem for this product no warranty show on item details it's big mistake,2
"Canon is running Digic 8 processor now, speed & quality heavily compromised due to old processor",2
"No rotating screen
No perfect for blogger and youtuber
Please add rotating screen for blogger and small youtubers
Rotating screen most important further future",1
"if you are a beginner to a photography world you need to start at least with this . canon is always a trustworthy
its easy to carry and use battery backup is also nice. lack of shutter cut is a drawback from my side i felt.",4
"Amazing product.

"As my first DSLR i won't except much from the camera as considering myself as an beginner in photography world but definitely recommending to all amateur photographers that this is the first step to learn and the camera does support you brilliantly, just keep experimenting and watch all tutorials for best results",5
Though I'm not into photography very much but still I can say that this DSLR is worth its price. Product was as expected and it's features are really good. In few reviews (online) I have read that the flash doest work but it really does work. WiFi connectivity is good. Overall I give it a 5 star or may be a 10/10 😊,5
"After a negative feedback from market for removing the universal hot shoe , canon is back again with the universal hot shoe .
I.e it supports ""Third party flash"" again.
I'm giving 5 star just for this
Rest , Amazon delivery was awesome!!",5
"You don't know whether product is genuine or not. Inferior quality of images. If you are beginner there is no gaurantee whether you receive a genuine product online. & when you ask them to return the item, they will keep canceling your pickup request like Joke. BE CAREFUL",1
"I would its a great bang for the buck at this price point i combined this camera with an 250 mm lens and looks how good the picture quality is
And I recommend this camera to all the beginners",4
"Excellent camera, especially for beginners, but helps to have prime lens to go with it like 85 mm. But hard to beat at this price.",4
"It’s a magnanimously magnanimous product . Nobody will say that , it take photos, it’s the cheapest price one you can buy . So it’s the base for all",5
Not sure how to use properly as sometime it works and capture automatically and other time it doesn't but good camera,5
Is any exchange available in place of old digital camera? If any it would be really helpful. I would like to exchange an old digital camera.,2
"This camera is simply the best in losing to Nikon d3500. That is why canon's ""discount"" coz this can't do crap.",5
It is a best camera for the bigners with its best quality of 25 megapixel . It captures a good quality photograph . It is also good if you need it for travelling and photoshoot . For me it's a good choice,3
I got this for 19000. At this price it's the best. But if the price is more than 25000 better buy a used camera with better specifications,3
"Canon 1500D

Best Budget Camera For me and I bought the 55-250 lens separately and the best picture quality I got with this.,5
EOS1300D performs the same at a still lower price. As it is a entry level dslr targeted to amateur photographers we could still go for a lower price 1300d rather than 1500d.,3
This canon 1500d is a nice start for beginners coming to photography. By using for 1 hours we can study its functions fully.,5
Product is good and packing was very well. In the video mode exposure is very low. Why this? In short it is a Good Camera.,4

"My first ever DSLR cannon 1500d. I bought it from Amazon wit grt Independence day offer around 23K. Package included 16 GB card, battery, cahrger, strap,new carry bag, camera body and a kit lense.
For beginners it's a great DSLR camera to learn photography.
I'm planning to buy a 50mm lense later.
Pros:
1. If you are new to DSLR , go for it
2. WiFi/NFC working well. I can shoot camera by using Android mobile phones with out touching the camera. very easy to connect and transfer file to mobile,computer etc.
3. Video quality also great.

Cons:
1. I feel bit heavy wit kit lense, I don't know may be I feel like that because I'm the first time dslr user.",5
"Got the set 1. Camera body 2. Kit lens 18-55mm VR 3. Kit lens 70-300 mm for Rs 33.5k. The camera sensor has exceptional imaging quality. I'm new to DSLR. It has been giving a true artistic expression of reality, which even a best quality phone camera can never do. Best camera for those who while pursuing photo clicking have come to know the limitations of a phone camera. See the pictures I have taken with and enjoy

Thank you Jeff and Co. for trustworthy, timely and secure delivery.",5
"Picture quality- Awesome, better purchase and see for yourself. Nikon basically is for stunning colours as the same colour vivid ness you can't find in any of the Canon DSLRs untill and unless they are full frame models.

Battery life- Avg. Usage of 2hrs every day gave the battery power running continuous for 3 days to me.

Durability- Here I have to mention that as it's a entry level DSLR. My suggestion go for it. Why? Let me explain

i. The grip on this is DSLR is almost like a professional cameras. Just go to shop and physically feel the grip. You'll love it. And do compare with other cameras also if I am no wrong.

ii. And for sure I have to say it's not weather resistant. According to me if you have 70 plus thousand rupees definitely go for weather sealed body full frame DSLRs. If not then grab this NIKON D3500 (An advanced model of 3400) released in the month of June 2018.

Lastly don't think whether to choose the entry level or professional camera. My suggestion a person should be enough patience to buy entry level first, because an entry level itself has a lots of menu options where you'll learn a lots of things. And after the completion of every option and one think Iam a professional person then go for a full frame DSLRs which costs around 1 to 1.5 lakh. My suggestion in that case would be NIKON D500 or CANON 6D Mark II.

Pls don't go for intermediate or Mid level cameras. Go basic level learn, experiment, go to field, study, repeat daily by varying different options, like ISO aperture and shutter speed, make yourself professional and then earn a very very good camera.

Thank you",4
"With max ISO 25600 you will get a better control over low light shots, than similar beginner-level Cannon models.

I chose this camera over Cannon 1500D because I heard a lot of critic reviews, and all of them were recommending Nikon.

The camera has a good grip, and doesn't much weigh, so you can easily take shots with one hand.

Most people have complained about no WiFi. I haven't missed that feature much. Because, I will not have a WiFi while taking shots outside. I can easily transfer the pictures to my computer using the SD card reader.

The camera doesn't have geo-tagging feature. But you can easily pair the SnapBridge App with the camera, and it will use phone's location and use it for geo-tagging. I really liked it.

Overall the camera is great.

Things I missed:

- It has a fixed display. Would have been great if it rotated.

P.S. I got all the items from Amazon, the Camera body, lens, bag and a 16GB SD card.",5
Just Awesome,5
"All the accessories/necessary part of camera is not genuine.
I got this dslr within two days of ordering it. It went well till the returnable period. Then suddenly I found both battery and charger defective. Defective Battery is not charging with the defective charger.
Apart from that, the USB cable required to transfer photos in laptop/desktop is also not in the box.
Want it to be replaced.
Its a trust issue. Hopeless with Amazon.",1
"SD Card missing from the kit. Apart from that, the USB cable required to transfer photos in laptop/desktop is also not in the box. Want it to be replaced.",1
"Awesome camera... excellent ""picture quality""..u should buy this product d3500.. don't go for d3400..I give guarantee buy Nikon d3500😍..also don't go for Canon...waste of money...Nikon is best and less price with high specifications",5
"This is worth for Rs.33500 after offers. I bought it mainly for taking picture of my kid who is so fast and mobile can't capture his activities. This very well survived the purpose. Picture quality is great and I am still exploring the 2 lens as a beginner.

Only downside is that Bluetooth Transfer is useless as it takes 5 min to copy 8mb file and the battery drained when I tried copying 100 photos. You can use your mobile USB cable to Copy your files but this shouldn't stop you from choosing it.
Go for it.",5
I got it for 24k in offer and believe me its a no brainer just go for it in this price no canon camera is equal to it lov d it and buyed 50mm prime lens and my kit is complete now. Fine quality with super fine pics.,5
"This is my first DSLR. I am very happy about this performance and picture quality. . This camera very easy to use. No need to join workshop . Just see video on YouTube. You will get everything knowledge. Very easy to shoot picture on different mode. I feel myself like professional photographer. . And thanks Amazon for before time delivery great packing. Trustful product. No need to think that online shopping is not trustful. It's wrong. All documents , manual and warranty card inside. I registered my product on Nikon website also",5
"I was very afraid 😨, that do u get a genuine product or not... Once 1 received and opened it I found.... yes... its great all the item where present their thing where there like memory card battery warranty card camera.. of course.. with other item like bag..
yes one can buy.... no problem",5
"Product not working as expectation yes the qualilty of product is good... but the amazon disappointed us because they showing in his website the product is available with the connectivity facility in the product with NFC, WIFi, and bluetooth. But the real product is not having with any type of wifi and nfc...... only bluetooth facility available in it......",2
SD card is not in the packet as shown while I was placing the order. And also carry case was not there.,1
"Nikons latest one of the D series.
Snapbridge is present and can be operated via Bluetooth only. (Pics transfer is very late via snapbridge because of only Bluetooth and no WiFi). I use snapbridge mostly for remote photos. Picture quality is great. I recommend",4
"I love my new camera ""D3500""... Picture quality and every bit of this DSLR is very good and upto the mark on this price range of DSLRs. Low light photography is not soo bad but I would suggest not increasing the ISO above 3200 as it leads to noisy pictures.
Today lots of phones have good camera and click very good pictures but not as good as the DSLRs if used properly. Explore your talents and imagination... HAPPY CLICKING!!",5
Pictures are really good..read many reviews and between cannon and nikon decided to go for Nikon...easy to use...dont have in depth knowledge about camera since I am a beginner but its definitely better than any phone's camera...checkout the picture I have attached,5
In this product box memory card and black case cover are missing. So pls place all orders carefully,1
16 GB (Class 10) SD card was not givem with the product....,1
"You can buy this with your eyes closed and be assured of a great deal. It is truly an advanced camera for the beginners as well as the professionals alike. I am an amateur and this must be my 10th camera including the 7th digital one. It feels great to hold it in the hand. Non-slippery ergonomic and beautiful body with all the controls adequately spaced and close to each other by moving the fingers slightly. Whether you use manual or automatic, or you wish to click jpeg or RAW, pictures are just great. You have a choice of optimizing your picture quality and fineness. Focusing is great. Additional manual focus ring besides the automatic is a boon. Viewfinder is great. Shutter release focusing as well as clicking is smooth and fast. Processing to write the images is superfast. Camera adjustments are easy and versatile for the beginner or the advanced user. If you are new, you can be well guided into photographing. What more you need, great pictures, done at ease with or without applying your mind. Depends, how you wish it to use it, it would stand by you like a good camera. Buy it with your eyes closed and enjoy the pictures you wish to take.",5
"The cameranis an amazing one especially for beginners. Amazing picture quality, easy to handle and compact. Got 16 gb memory card with the camera. For professional photography, go for a higher option. D3500 is an excellent one to use as a family camera. Can transfer photographs to laptop or computer via normal android phone cable. Eveeything is superb at this price range. The camera bag is also good one.",5
"All over it is good,
But i have issue with battery as per description it is not so long lasting and secondly the body get more hotter then it should be i think the product is good but with the problem of battery it make the product bad according to my knowledge the bettery is defective.",3
"So many of us will ready to buy this, because of this product has NFC and WIFI. Once you buy and realize there is NO wifi and NFC you will definitely disappointed.

I always believe amazon and it will provide allow and provide trusted information about product but it fails becuase of this product descriptions.",3
"I have watched a lot of review videos on youtube and other sites, that's what I usually do before buyig any major product. First of all Nikon 3500 is my first dslr, and I am quite surprised by its picture quality and Easy User interface. So if you are a new dslr user or if it is your first dlsr you can Buy it without any second thought. This is one of the best cameras in this price range. And trust me you won't be disappointed. I don't usually write reviews, but I had to this time I am very happy with this purchase. And as uasuall Amazon never disappoint me with its packing and delivery. All in all 5 star.",5
"Got this Camera today and was it well packed, thank you, Amazon for the neat package. Recieved all the items for this camera. Kept it for a first charge and waiting it to complete charge before exploring the world of DSLR. I feel good about this. I Will post usage review in a week or two. Am I satisfied now? I am pumped. Have fun guys.",5
Cannot take video more than 5 minutes the screen becomes white in cooler by itself which prevents me from seeing what is being captured on camera. It’s a fake DSLR Nikon camera.,1
"I purchased it along with set of 2 lens.
Autofocus works well actually but in a complex scenario it finds itself difficult to focus(very rare condition).
Colour contrast and reproduction of images is good comparatively in this price range.
Go for it only if you are an amateur to photography, although it nikon has tried to improve its old features and fit a bit new, but still I find some more features must have been added for beginners like retractable screen, increased image size and quality (last picture size u can get is 6000*4000, not more than that).
As there is a saying, smooth sea never makes a good sailor, hopefully full featured camera may not make the best photographer unless we know to explore the full potential of this camera.
I know people who shot awesome photos in mobile camera rather some people struggle for same composition in dslr.
Slightly there's a bit lag in image preview, like 2-3 sec after every image u click, hv to wait untill it loads.
Battery backup is pretty awesome, lasts longer than others in this price range.
No shortcut iso button which makes bit lesser competitive because when you shoot in manual mode u can't get the constant light condition in evry direction, except auto iso can help, but it won't give the required effects u need if you can't manually adjust it really quick.
Inbuilt image editing options are explorable and work quite well
Effects in dial are pretty good, overall I feel nikon has user-friendly operating system.
Those moon photos were taken using 300mm lens in manual mode with exposure being in negative column, then retouched in Photoshop cc.
Hope you'll make your decision and think on your purchase.",4
"Back when i was a kid all i had the family SLR film camera to play with. Though I was mostly fascinated with the gadget and never really got any good at photography. Having given up on taking photos for well over a decade i decided to give it another go. After surveying the various available camera types and models in the market i narrowed on this one. I have to say i am thoroughly impressed with the convinience, features and not mention cost-effectiveness of digital photography compared to film! And the image quality is just great. The ability to capture FHD video is a bonus. Worth every paisa.",5
"My first day of any camera -
Getting to know the features. It works wonder for the nature photography . Lets see how it goes for the rest of it.. till now best for the nature photography . I want to use it for the vlogging for my pet and his pics are still difficult to capture.
Con- doesnot have a wifi option ..so need to get a cable or a sd Card reader or a cable to tranfer the images and the bluetooth doesnot work to tranfer videos just the transfer of images is possible.
I am having thoughts to get one with the wifi. Or should I wait.",3
"Battery backup is insane, picture quality is awesome, built quality is good. Perfect start for beginner photographers. If you want to take some more awesome lowlight shots buy a Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G lens separately that will take your game to the another level.
Loving the camera already with the kit lenses.",5
"This is the right DSLR for beginners. If you learn some basic techniques you can click amazing shots with D3500. I got a well packaged camera in two days for decent Rs. 26500.( cheaper than dealer’s price) When combined with Capture NXD free download, Power of RAW files can be put to use. 18-55 mm lens is not a great one, but is a good starting point. Having learnt some basics I miss the ability of the camera to shoot at high aperture. Unfortunately the kit lens does not go beyond f/5.6 in M mode ( and I look forward to add a f/2.8 prime 50 mm soon). However lenses can be purchased for a bargain from dealers directly.
After theee months of usage : Have shot some awesome images with silhoutte. As I learnt more about photography I realise it’s 70 % of how you use the camera settings and the rest is about the lens.",4
"It is the best beginner level dslr you can get right now in this price range.it is best in photography,and still videos in this price range.it did pretty well in every photo types, focous problem was there during shooting flying birds ,but again it also depends on lens used.in maximum number of time it did great.if you want to explore it's full potential then do switch to manual control as soon as possible.any camera will do fine with good lens,just invest more on lens.you will be fine with this camera
Do Visit my insta for pics with this cam - @r_a_z_o_r_i_n_e",5
"A very good and quality product- Nikon dslr D3500 Camera. For beginners it is need to read the manual carefully and also must be educated in Exposure Trio means Shutter speed,Aperture and ISO to click manually. Everything is good but should have a shortcut key for ISO adjustment. I got the product in 28k with 18-55mm kit lens. It maybe 2k less in price compare to camera shops. I am rating giving you 4 stars. It's ok. I preferred Amazon. Thanks.",4
"Product was not so good.
I bought it in November 2019,
But now my nikon dslr has so many problems.
Like its screen issue, and also the camera..its completely shut down.I really didnot expect that from amazon and nikon .",3
"Hello All,

Before I start writing my review, first of all, I would like to send thanks to Amazon and the seller ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"" for their amazing 5***** service and providing me this top-notch product.

I finally received my Camera #Nikon D3500 D that I ordered on 7th June 2020 with Kit lens 18-55mm VR and 70-300 mm .

In order to cut long review short (In a nutshell)-

1. Awesome machine for capturing memorable moments - specially who are beginners and are planning to buy a new camera to start but getting confused - I would not say much - just look at the shots that I took and uploaded here from my camera and you yourself will come to know what I am trying to say as there is a saying ""A Pictures Speaks Thousand of Words"" (Please note- all of these uploaded pictures have taken from its kit lenses itself - I didn't use any prime lens for these blurry effects).

2. I don't want to go deeper into the technicality here - I would simply recommend all to buy this camera if you are specially looking to have your Camera for general photography purpose - not for commercial use. For Day to Day photography - it's A Jack Of All Trades!

3. Easy to handle 5/5

4. Picture Quality/Sharpness wise - 5/5 :)

5. For Beginners - just start with these two lenses first as this is fine enough - but down the line if you feel then go for other lenses such as Prime 50mm.

6. Try to shot via Manual Mode/A/S/P Only (An advise for beginner only) - First start with the Auto Mode - Learn & Experience it, then go with the advanced level then you will enjoy the true performance of the machine :)

At last, I would like to end by saying - Don't confuse with any other machine especially when planning to buy a beginner level camera - buy it with closed eyes :)

Thanks,
Parikshit",5
"Best for beginners and medium level photographers. The telephoto lens is awesome. Other kit 18-55 lens is very basic, gives you nothing. Go for purchasing a prime lens if you can.

Picture quality and colour reproduction is very good. Though focussing is an issue.",4
Good camera for the beginner like me. This is my first Dslr camera and I am very satisfied with the performance of this camera. Picture quality is excellent and the battery performance is superb. But sometimes this camera hangs if you are taking pictures very quickly shot after shot. So you need to stop for few seconds before taking new shot. Pictures are good but it should be more vivid.,4
"The best camera in this price range..
Picture quality is awesome ...
Deal of 70-300 lens is very affordable...
Bettery backup is really awesome 1500-1600 shots per charging.....dont think much go blindly.",5
The DSLR cameras come with an advantage because they have a lens with variable focal length and aperture. It allows them to regulate the amount of light that enters the camera thereby ensuring images of better quality. Smartphone cameras have autofocusing lenses. They can be slow at times and experience shutter lag.,5
"This camera is really handy and good for beginners. The packing also had carry bag which
was unexpected. The packing should have been better as the main box was not fitted to hold the D3500 box firmly and I think it came wobbling from packing to delivery. Luckily the D3500 box had all Camera items in slots with good fit. Good to buy one more battery if you travel or click regular pics.",5
Its simply amazing.. better than d3400,5
"I will not provide any too high information here. Buying this camera i hope you are a beginner in photography or dslr .this product you have to buy a lot more accesories if interested in mannual mode. Auto mode requires nothing just press the shutter !
Please do follow @hikewithabhijeet on instagram for magic this device can do if operated mannually!",5
"Only DSLR can beat the Phone Camera.
I experienced with it above the expectations. This is my first experince with DSLR, Fast delivery within 3 days only. Got all the items in Box as listed in list.The quality of the Body and Lances are really awesome, even picture quality.
Very good product for Beginners & Propesaionals.
Totaly worth the cost",5
"One of the best DSLR for the beginner photographers. Trust me, you can buy an expensive camera but untill you know how to use it, it is worthless. So, Nikon D3500 gives you the best results and worth buying.

Never forget- It is never about the camera, it's about the skills. Polish your skills, get yourself this beast and explore :)

Happy Clicking :)",5
"The nikon camera is worth buying for the beginners at this price range. I would suggest If you want to have dslr like image quality and low light photography then you have to purchase 35mm or 50 mm fast lenses at least. As shown in the description, the devise is not wifi/NFC enabled. However bluetooth connectivity and mini hdmi ports are available.",5
"For beginners this is best camera and if you have some money always prefer to take 70-300mm lens to enjoy more power of this device....
Battery backup is just awsome....change once and go for trip it will do it duty very well......

Learn about manual adjustment of this camera and ypu will rock....
Pros:
Battery
Price
Built quality

Cons:
Only 11 focus points are present.,..",5
"Don't know much about DSLRs. It's my first time using one & I'm damn happy. I feel the colour capture is amazing. Buttons, dials, locks, clicks are all perfect. Feels premium enough & great in hand. Build quality is amazing. I'll definately recommend to others.",5
"Best camera for beginners.best outdoor pictures.the lens is too good for long range shots.can capture moving objects with the maximum shutter speed of 1/4000.for beginners, also buy cleaning kit with camera other wise there is a chance of fungal growth.its picture quality is really good than canon.but it has only Bluetooth connectivity no wifi.so it takes more time to transfer the photos.it has good battery backup also takes few more time to charge",4
"The camera build quality is super and very great for bigners also battry bakup is awsome u can click upto 1500 shots.

Picture quality 10/10
Video quality. 8/10
Focusing. 7/10
Battery. 10/10

If you are a normal photographer then this is for you
I have using for video
Awsome product by amazon",5
"Amazon cheating customers telling that d3500 having wifi, nfc too but it is having only blutooth. Rest of the features are good, this dslr is for entry level photographers, i like it and u should buy dual lens... As buying lenses separtely is expensive.",1
One of the best DSLR camera for beginners. Great and innovative guide on how to take perfect photos. I'm enjoying with the purchase.,5
"Its good product, i got it with missed parts..latter i they replaced with new one..Thanks",4
"Value for money. I got it for 28k. The pictures are really awesome even in low light conditions.
The kit lens is almost okay.
For getting more bokeh just go for the prime lenses.",5
"If you are beginner than this DSLR is awsum.
Easy to use and carry.
All features are good.
Easily connected to mobile also via its app and all images got imported easily.
Overall experince 10 out of 10.
If you want to buy this DSLR dont hesitate to buy it just buy and experince it.",5
I bought this in 2019 and have been using it since. The camera is very good but it does not have a touch screen so still have to manage with the buttons but that's not much of a hassle. The pictures come quite good of you know what you're doing. I bought both the lenses but you don't need to buy both as you would rarely be using the 70mm lens. Overall a good product. Recommended!,5
I really liked the way Amazon delivered the product by securing end to end of the camera box but even though the cable which usually comes with cameras aren't present in the box (like HDMI cable ) the camera and lenses performed very well indeed the delivery was quick and trackable thus I conclude by saying Amazon did a great job,4
"If you are a beginner,then Nikon D3500 is the best choice for you in this price.The picture quality is stunning and both the lenses are damn good.The battery life is impressive too.It takes 1.5 -2hrs to get fully charged.",4
"As a beginner I bought this cam on my b'day with lots of confusion as I don't know nothing about dslr and now I'm in love with this product, I would like to thank Amazon for their amazing delivery as usual, Definitely a great cam for beginners I've learned lot from the cam itself as it has built-in guide feature and it has some filters, modes and so on...

My rating - 11/10🔥",5
"The camera is well beyond my expectations. Quite light in weight and operations are very smooth. I got two lenses too, including the 70-300mm lense, for a total price of about Rs 35,000. Very affordable price.",5
"Thank you Amazon.. I was waiting for long time and finally I got for just 21K after using SBI debit card 😍... About performance 🤔.. Brand name is enough, it says lot.. best picture quality and build quality too.. you will love guys don't think just go for it..",5
"Brought it as a gift for my love during great festival sale. She wants to learn photography and I believe this is the best DSLR for entry level photographers. She is loving it.....Thanks to Amazon....The product was well-packed, no any issues in the product body and it works fantastic!!!👍😃",5
"The camera is not good, please don't buy it, Amazon is giving bad products nowadays
I think they gave a returned product. Please be careful, I have stoped bying products from AMAZON after this, they didn't want to return the camera back, it was a 46000 loss for me",1
Camera Screen is defective.... I received all items I ordered for and when I assembled all parts and turn on the camera Screen was found defective ..... Now returning this product,1
Nice camera for beginners go for it but do purchase in offers like great Indian sale you will get huge price drop upto 23k,5
I'm a newbie with DSLR cameras but loved this piece as its not at all complicated. Amazing entry level DSLR. Functions are pretty easy to understand. Timely delivery by Amazon. Go for it.,5
"Unable to charge the battery with the defective charger within 3 months of purchase.
Thereby the camera has become useless without the charger
No response from the dealers and service centers while enquiring about the complaint",1
"Excellent!!! Must buy... In budget...+ Original Product..+ Fast Delivery + Premium Quality + ... no words to say...
Writing this review after using Nikon Camera for 2 Months
Guys...Just go for it...! Recommend dont scroll down for another review... believe just go for it... 10/10*.",5
The picture quality is very good in day light Bt struggles a bit under low light.. Shutter is responsive and snap bridge official app of nikon works cool.... Auto focus is bit unaccuate given 11 focus points.... Bt can't expect more from entry level camera and kit lens.. . Overall happy with the product,4
Not good,1
It's my first camera purchase and use. The pictures I took are attached for reference. They are not in original quality here but truly they are fantastic. I rate this camera pretty good for beginner but it's a feedback coming from a person who hasn't used any other camera before. So beware before you take this review for granted.,5
"I could not find the camera inside the box. The box was just a camera bag,Apart from this, nothing related to the camera was found inside the box",1
"Nikon 3500 is the first DSLR I bought and I have no regrets. It produces such an awesome result, I click photos from my phone also, but the quality which a DSLR gives, a phone can never give. I am using it for the past 6 months and never found an issue. I am totally satisfied with this camera and I highly recommend it. Both the lenses are good, I personally like the pictures clicked from 70-300mm. Depends on the object you want to capture, both produce great results. 5/5.",5
"Good camera for beginners. Great ISO control, good auto mode. A bit expensive for the give fratures it has, but still, makes up for low light pics. Very low noise compared to canon 1300/1500D. Compact size and easy to handle. One of the better choices in budget DSLR in india right now.",4
Camera Bag is not good.,1
"Came without battery and then the entire return process was a nightmare.

Finally it all happened after some escalations.",1
"Easy to use. Lightweight. Came properly packed.
Just make sure the SD card is packed properly. It was stuck under the box on the plastic. Could have thrown it away by mistake.",5
"Ease of use
Nature photography
Bundled offer of camera plus 70-300 Telephotolense is great value for money",5
"Trying to develop photography as a hobby, I feel it is a good buy for beginners, myself being one.
Thanks to Amazon for it's offer, I purchased the item for around 24k rupees.
All the items and accessories mentioned in the product details were packed and delivered neatly.",5
"This is a perfect dslr for entry level photographers. We have all the basic controls and can also achieve great pictures using the product. If you have an hight budget, do go for Nikon D5300 or above, it will definitely help you.",5
Great camera all items with product i received which seller promised the camera is better than canon 1500d in future i am going to buy lens thank you appario Ltd and amazon.,5
The product is good and i have recieved all the accessories as mentioned. Thank you.,5
"Auto focus is good but not so great. This does not means its bad. It works well. As beginner its good. But once u r used to it, u will find it bit boring as ur requirement from a DSLR will be higher. If u r beginner, blindly go for it, or else go for some higher version",5
It's very good entry level camera for beginners. It does the job. Picture qualities are good. If you are buying for video shooting then get a stand too to avoid video shaking.,5
I didn't receive cable to transfer data from camera to laptop,3
SD card is not with the package . feel cheated,1
Display is not working within 2 month. No one is responding to fix the issue. Need help.,1
"Its good for a beginner with little cost add-ons. but you can go for 3400 too. It is less rate and almost wiyh same configs.

They should provide lens hood when they are charging this much for product.",5
"Very good product for the beginners.
Best battery performance ( if you use the viewfinder) (I left it on for a week😅 and it works )
Kit lenses does it job good (it don't have auto and manual change button)
Ultimately its upto the user and there skills.",5
"Good product for beginners. Have been using it for almost 8 months now. Focus and apparatus is very nice.
The beginners can learn & handle it easily.",5
"Best ever camera, i am having DSLR for 1st time still got to know all thongs easily and really best camera in all these price segment, loved it ❤️ thanks Amazon

cons: no wifi only bluetooth option is available still no worrying they have awesome snapbridge application we can use it for direct downloading images.",5
"Nice camera, good battery backup, but when I put the zoom lens its take some time to auto focus on the object. Otherwise a good 4 star product. Best in its range for beginners.",4
I ordered the 2 lense bundle and the 300mm lense was not included . I’ve asked for an exchange hopefully it’s included this time,1
I purchased this priduct but unfortunate battery not working more that 20 min. I am not able to contact customer care also. Please replace the product or refund my amount.,1
"One of the best entry level DSLRs. Got this with the kit lens as well as the 70-300mm telephoto lens. Was able to take a pic of the Milky Way even with some light pollution. Excellent depth of field. Only one problem is that sharing of files over WiFi is not available. Otherwise, an excellent DSLR.",5
I got it delivered on time as expected. Nice & very handy product. Pictures of 50-300 mm lens is awesome. Happy to use it. But got a currepted SD card. Unable to use & format it even with comond promt. Rest all ok. Thanks Amazon,5
I bought new product but battery along with it faulty so called customer care but they denied for battery replacement of brand new camera they said return it pathetic service Nikon,1
Quality is not good...,1
"1. Best for beginners.
2. Nice night photography.
3. Long exposure - upto 30sec
4 . No external mic for recording.

I bought it over canon 1500d.",5
The camera is good for beginners but the memory card that I was provided was not working and frequently got corrupted. Otherwise the camera is good. Sturdy and stable and gives good quality pictures. Only negative is fixed screen but when you use more of view finder it doesn’t really matter always,5
Display screen blacked out after 5 days. Then a long lockdown and no service centre nearby.,2
"A thin ring around the 70-300mm lens got peeled off after a few days, even with very careful handling and usage.",1
Its just a basic cam better go for little bit more expensive one this is a very limited camara just like digital cam.,3
sd card and usb cable missing from the pack.,2
"The picture clarity is good and video recording is also in HD quality , the price of camera is bit high but worth for the quality of picture . Battery perspective could have been given more and when we need to take the pictures in large lense the battery drains very fast overall the I would rate 4 out of 5 for this product",4
For beginners it's very good camera. Make sure you buy 75-300 lens for best photo shoot. Cons: Transfer of data should be WiFi but still it's in Bluetooth platform. Latency in data transfer even though their app.,5
I bought this by my sbi credit card but no cashback offer for this purchase. Reliance digital offered 30500 rs.,3
"Nothing to say really, does the job like nothing else in the range. Know the basic stuff atleast before getting one, it won't disappoint.",5
Good Picture quality and Nice product for basic DSLR and Easy to share photos from DSLR to Mobiles using Snapdragon and Zooming lens was awesome Video recording also very nice I bought the best price 33400-00 In Amazon great Indian sale But one bad thing is no WiFi option in this camera.,5
"It's a Best DSLR entery level camera for beginners. Easy to use, user friendly interface. Try and test in different modes of operation other than Auto.

Disappointed because Amazon reduced 1700/- rupess after 2 days of my purchase.",4
"Got this camera set in just 31999 during the sale,at this price point it is a marvelous camera the best part is picture quality,battery,compactness....",5
"Best for beginners & lovely point n shoot for closer pictures, potraits",5
"I had experienced with this cam, was awesome.. Value for money, but audio jack not available, and if you are thinking for the video recording then don't buy this...",5
it's costly now before it was 26500/- and I bought at 32500/- price,5
Good as First Camera. Need to learn a lot of things before I could comment about it. Seems ok but frankly speaking phones with good cameras turn out to be quick and hassle free these days.,5
"Best for beginners and better than canon 1500D..
Fallin in love😙😍 with it..
Really awesome..",5
"Yes, as far as the beginner goes, the camera is perfect for them",4
"3 star for Camera quality which is good, but Camera does not have WiFi and NFC connectivity, Amazon is making fool customers by mentioning WiFi and NFC over product description.. no issues with picture quality but atleast they have to mention real things.. Really Disappointed with Amazon this time",3
"I am not a professional, but this DsLR has a lot to do. If you want to be a professional in a lower to spend, you must go for this D3500 beast. Excellent for photography, not much satisfied with video-shoots. Amazing buy.",5
"Value for Money. Beginners can start photography in Auto mode. Once you are comfortable you can learn Manual mode from Nikon school website or from YouTube.
Photo size is 5-6 mb.",5
"1) Delivery by Amazon: Before expected arrival
2) Product review: Good for beginners, too many modes and settings to learn. One can learn to get better exposure triangle.
Even i am new but learnt few things through youtube.",4
"This is my first dslr camera . So far so good.
I m learning photography.
Thanks to Amazon for giving me this camara for good price. It was far more expensive on other sites and local camara dealers.",4
"It's been two years 😍😍😍.... Battery backup is perfect. Lot of memories captured.

Ps: Purchase with Zoom lens 🙌🙌🙌",5
"One of the best for beginners and I recommended this for few of my friends. As you improve, no need to buy another camera, a different lens is enough.",5
"It is OK for beginners but the functions are too complicated, by the time to change your settings, it is possible that the object you want to click might have moved.",3
Good product.. battery is nice work.,4
Best one for beginners from Nikon... loved the product... Delivered on time... Value for money... Clarity is so good... Packaged so well... Worthful one #Nikond3500,5
Best for the price .,5
"This is a entry level camera and it does all the basic stuff smoothly, don't expect much from this camera or you will be disappointed. Solid build and strong body. The camera is good for one who are starting their passion/career in photography.",4
"For beginners it's awesome to use and we can learn how to take a perfect snaps
Picture quality ok battery backup also gud..",4
Perfect dslr for beginners.picture quality is nice.can do fast auto focusing.performs well in low light conditions. Light weight.nice grip.if we know adjusting manual mod it feels better than auto mode.overall it s a nice product,4
SD card is missing in packet,3
"As per the product details, Memory Card was not included. Its written in box also that 16Gb memory card included. But there was no memory card in the box.
Picture quality is awesome....",5
"Your search for the perfect beginner camera has come to an end. Go for it!
Buy the 70-300 lens as well.",5
"I'm return this product.
I'm got a defective product.
When i install battery. It's got very hit. that why I'm returned it. But camera is ok best for beginners
And it's picture quality is very good.",3
Not that much great as mentioned. for better results we have to buy other lenses which are more cost. Please don't expect much from camera.portrait was very bad.,3
Nice product for beginners. Only thing I would like to mention that it takes long to transfer pictures from DSLR to smartphone (via Bluetooth). No wi fi option.,5
"Boon for beginners like me...just go for it without any second thought...❤️
Picture quality is damn awesome...you have to play with settings and it’s enjoyable...more you play more will learn...Its just love...",5
"Camera is nice but price is high. I got it 28k from amazn.
I live in local city or else...
Main problem.",4
It's the go to for beginners. Overall a good experience and a lot to learn. But it's the start and you can start from here,4
"Best beginner dslr camera out there.
Buy some good lenses and you are good to go
Posting some pictures taken from nikon d3500.",4
The Camera Is Very Very Good & Item is very good Enough only give suggestion is if anybody buy any camera always buy with double lens combo pack bcoz it is very cheaper in rate & Have the best reasonable price u get.,5
Safe packing - received all seals intact company original pack- detail review will follow,4
"I bought this nikon d3500 dslr few days back and when i was registering myself on nikon site, the serial number shown as invalid.",4
I never used DSLR before. For my travel purpose I brought one. Really nice. The picture quality is great. Thanks to Amazon for delivering it on time,5
"Excellent Camera for Beginner , It is my first Camera , Easy to use , Easy to get picture into our mobile",5
Best camera in easy price good for biggners .,5
This product has been my dream come true. Loved the pics and can't wait to explore more of its features.,5
"Camera is excellent, a lot better than a smartphone camera when it comes to capturing details, but the kit lens puts a limitation to the camera, must buy other lens as well",5
"The D3500 is simple to use, captures good pictures and is lightweight, so doesn't burden you.",4
Good,5
Writing review after using it for one year. It is amazing for beginner level photographer and for hobbyists,5
"Like: build quality
Dislike: since I am just a beginner, I cannot comment cons now",4
Nanba it is really superb. I purchased with two hearted. But its output gives me satisfaction,5
The camera is perfect for beginners. What I would recommend is to get a good prime lens if you want to take portraits because the kit lens is very basic.,5
Go for the two lens kit. 70-300mm is a must have 👍🏻,5
"I bought this product in June'19, and after 2 months of using it I can say that it's the best choice for beginners in this price segment The only one thing which I felt could have been improved a bit was it's battery life. It's pretty avg.",5
"Super, good option to connect directly mobile device. Fine",5
"Overall the best buy for entry level photographers. I should recommend Nikon to make way for adjustable self timers because there is only a 10s timer if it were adjustable, then we could have made it 5s or 3s etc.",5
"Seller described wifi, NFC and bluetooth (all inbuilt) for the connectivity but it only has Bluetooth and no wifi , no NFC present in camera.",4
Beginners can click mind blowing and absolutely fantastic images in Nikon D3500. It is too worth for its prices & the kit lenses are doing much better. Nikon D3500 will be a good companion for those who are fond of clicking the special moments & memories.,5
Features are awesome,5
Fabulous camera for beginners. No Mobile Phone can match the quality or details.,5
"Good DSLR for beginners .Great product for this money.Good packing , on time delivery and etc.",5

But I love the product",5
Nice camera light weight easy to use. With 350mm lens u get nice close pics. Battery life ok. Picture quality with 18mm could have been better,5
Whole new dimension in photography for me,5
Company must provide manual in CD form and Videos in the CD that will help user to use with better precessions.,5
"Simply saying, Smartphones take better pictures. Go for it if you want to show-off a DSLR.",3
The camera is good and easy to use for beginners like me. However the manual should have been more details since D3500 is meant for beginners,5
SD card is missing from the package. I can't return it as I need this urgently. Do not expect SD card if you are ordering this,2

"I exchanged my Nikon d3200 for this and there are a lot of things that disappoints me about the camera as well as love it.

Is this worth an upgrade? Is this the best camera out there.

Today I will explain it to you in detail

Design and build

The build is solid like most Nikon camera, it is not very premium but what you get is a hard plastic well built compact DSLR camera that is super compact and very grippy to hold.

What disappointed me was how similar the design was to the old model, the design of the old camera was not bad, but this one has the same feel and buttons with few extra changes that are very pleasing.

You have a viewfinder toggle switch that feels very used compared to the button on the previous model, you also get an adjuster dialer which is designed a little better than the old one but performs just like the old one.

I felt Nikon could have changed the design a little bit for those upgrading to the newer model, everything works well here so I can live with this.

The camera is very compact and has the same battery holder and card holder design like the previous one, what I love about this camera is how compact it feels to hold in your hand and carry around, I am sure Nikon understand that this camera is for those who are entering the world of DSLRs and would want something that is easy to carry and simple to use and it does this gracefully.

Battery life and performance

What surprised me about this camera was the mammoth jump that it takes as far as battery life is concerned. The battery life on this is extraordinary. I was never discontent with the battery on the Nikon d3200 however, this one is on another dimension with a company claim of more than 1500 shots approx, the battery life on this has been extraordinary.

https://amzn.to/2AUj4Jn

I am not going to post a comparison review here because it will make the review very long. But both Cameras are great and have their own set of pros and cons.

Conclusion

A well-finished camera by the house of Nikon, it is compact has a fantastic battery life, easy to use and has a lot of options to add your fx and dx type of lens.

The camera is flawed by few updates which were required in the newer model, in the world of vlogging it simply disappoints with an absence of an articulating screen, the resolution of the screen does not impress either, but if you are a beginner and entering into DSLRs, you should definitely consider this and if you are not, and looking for a decent upgrade check this out

https://amzn.to/2U5GfYr

Pros

1.fantastic battery performance
2.fast snappy chipset
3.Nikon quality and build
4.very well priced, value for money deal
5.very compact, a joy to hold and easy to carry
6.well laid out controls that are all within your reach

Cons
1.display could have been better
2.Still no articulating screen
3. The app still needs to improve
4.not worth an upgrade from the older model

A very well made camera with good performance and battery life. One of the first DSLR I purchased with the 3200 and this one will be a decent first camera for you.

Hope my review helped 😊

Cheers",4
Nikon D5100 was so bad that I decided I would never buy a Nikon again. The auto focus was terrible. The image noise cancellation and high sensitivity performance was so bad. The LCD got damaged very quickly. The biggest problem was that it didn't have manual exposure settings in video. There was no option for grid overlay. The mic input was of no use as you couldn't control the sensitivity efficiently and the internals were poor quality. The file size of videos especially was too big but that could have been tolerated had they been anywhere near average quality. I tried ridiculously hard to get rid of it. Phew.,1
Nice product from Nikon..!!!,5
"Hi guys, I bought this camera last month.. For past 2 years, had a dream of buying dslr.. Finally I got it.. In Amazon, price is around 50k for kit lens plus 70-300mm lens, I bought it in near by showroom.. I got it for 41.5k... I asked showroom owner, he said due to demand the price is little bit more in Amazon..

Though I don't know anything about dslr, I had an interest in bird photography, so I'm learning basic things from nikon YouTube channel, and v2k photography, so I'm learning a lot..so if u r amateur like me.. Go for this camera, and learn things..",5
"This DSLR is good for beginners, i have bought it in Reliance digital for 45000/- including 18-55mm and 70-300mm lenses.
Picture quality is outstanding. U can record non-stop 30min video in low quality, 20min in medium quality, 10min in high quality.
Nikon D3500 is perfect choice for beginners, if are confused between Canon and Nikon, go for nikon undoubtedly.",4
"The cost shown in amazon for Nikon D3500 with AF-P DX Nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR in amazon was 44,999 but when you check same in other E-Commerce its 36,000 and even in nikon website is 37,000.
So be carefully before buying it",1
"You don't need to be a photographer to know a great photo when you see one. And you don't need to be a photographer to take a great photo you just need the D3500. It's as easy to use as a point-and-shoot, but it takes beautiful DSLR photos and videos that get noticed. It feels outstanding in your hands, sturdy and balanced with controls where you want them. It's compact, durable and versatile, ideal for travel. And it works seamlessly with compatible smartphones, making it easier than ever to share your great photos. Even if you've never picked up a DSLR camera, you can take beautiful pictures with D3500.",5
"Best camera for beginners, i bought it from local dealer in december for rs 42000/- , later in january the gst prices have been reduced ,though iam happy it deliver specatucalur images , the battery life was amazing iam getting nearly 1300 shots with mixed usage of flash for shots , if u want to buy go for it , but consider taking with two lens 18-55mm and 70 -300mm",5
"Best Entry Level DSLR camera Till now
Love the Pic Quality
Love NIKON ❤️
Go for it,😊
Got it @34750🔥🔥",5
Loved the improvements over the D3400. It's about 20% light and has all the control buttons to the right. Welcome the pleasant change in design.,5
"7k over priced than , Croma.
Thank god my transaction got declined on Amazon.
Same Dual kit 39500 on Croma.",1
"The camera is good but it's missing some imp function, Cannot attach MIC and Cannot handle it remotely from a computer.

Its major drawback. Though is for beginners the cost is not for beginners.
I cannot shoot video from far because it will impact on the voice recording.

I recommend going for Canon or other companies where you get external mic port and which support remotely control from a computer.",1
Just over the moon that i got the camera with dual lenses for the meagre price of 28999. Thank you Amazon for the amazing offer. Desoerately waiting for the camera to arrive. Will update with pictures and more.,5
"One of the Best Entry Level DSLR Camera 📷🔥👌🏼
Great For Beginners 😉👍🏼

Go For it, I bought it from the market...",5
"I did not buy the product. But i want to now why there is so many reviews from italy and europe countries.
We are looking this from india so why not indians views are here.",5
A good camera for beginners and professionals as well. A bit of knowledge is definitely required to operate this beauty other than once you become a pro using this camera. This can even become your bestie..❤️❤️,5
"Great entry level DSLR. Pictures arr aweome light weight compact DSLR easy to carry and in good price range, the thing which annoying is no bag with the product we need to buy it seprately.

design was also great all the buttons on right side which is great thing.

Rest Nikon nailed it with this. Small light weight easy to carry.",4
I'm new at DSLR photography. I like to click nature and that's why I brought it. Before this camera I used mobile phones only. These are some clicks from my Nikon D3500. Till now I am happy with it. Though I am learning.,5
"E-COMMERCE WEBSITES/PORTALS ARE NOT OUR AUTHORIZED PARTNERS/ DEALERS IN INDIA FOR SALE OF NIKON PRODUCTS OR ACCESSORIES.

"Perfect DSLR for beginners .Just very handy n easy to use.If u are beginner just watch tutorial n buy this DSLR n feel professional.
Photography is not a rocket science.keep intrested n find smart way .",5
"i personally have used many canon as well as nikon cameras, i find that canon has a more sturdy build and the picture quality, especially the focus is greater in canon cams, so if you're going to get a camera for professional photography i suggest go for canon",3
nice the picture quality with colors. best camera entry level. D3500 Nikon vs Cannon is best product you should buy......,5

Overall nice.. but i opt mobile than this.. bcos its nit practically feasible to carry it everywhere,5
"I got this camera after seeing rave reviews in YouTube. However, this review will focus on the shortcomings only. I discovered after 10 days of use.
1. Poor battery life : does not last even 3 hours of use. However, this is compensated by the extra battery provided. But the way battery compartment is designed does no good to the purpose. you need to unscrew from mount to change The battery. So you will need to break your schedule in case u are shooting something continuous.
2. Error Error - the dreaded E:62:10 error appeared in my camera after few days of use. Although I did not face any difficulty in shooting. It did make my experience bitter. Could not resolve though the solutions available on internet. The usual switch on of. Change battery etc does not work and the error message is a part of the display now.
3. Mic : even tough the mic is a strong one. It does not do well to reduce background noise.
4. Charging time : 150 mins. This really restricts ur ability to shoot and u need to plan ahead if you are a serious vlogger.
5. Not weather proof. : the manual says it is not weather proof and small amounts of water may damage the internal circuits. I mean why? It restricts your ability to take outdoor shoot and a vlogger would not take this.

Apart from the above. The camera delivers what it promises in the review videos.

Update :
My lens assembly was faulty. Thankfully Sony service centre was open and as directed by the Sony representative, I gave the camera for repair. It took 14 days to get the part from abroad and complete the repairs. Now, the camera is working fine. No issues as such.
Update 2: Please go through the settings and understand each setting before shooting. There are a lot of helpful YouTube videos on this camera.
Update 3 : The camera worked fine for 2 days after repairs. As of now it is still in the repair shop. 2 months after purchase the camera is 28 days.(and counting) in repair shop. Even after 2 trips of repair shop the error does not go away. Now it is a permanent display in my camera.
Update 4: Sony had finally replaced the camera with a new one. Will update if there are issues in the new one. From mid September to mid December the camera was in the repair centre for at least 50 days before it was finally replaced.",4
"Good camera but not a perfect camera.
Slightly over priced and image stabilization is not good. If you want to see full review with video samples,you can see on
Dr Kalpana singh YouTube channel.",4
"I have purchased early morning on the launch date, received the next day under Prime one day delivery!
The box comes with camera, Bluetooth grip, 64gb memory card, two batteries, wind screen and usb cable which makes it a complete package.
First impression on quality is good. I was searching for pocket sized compact light weight camera capable to take DSLR quality photo/video and this one solves the purpose.
Follow the attached image how small it is holding within the palm!",5
"1. Video stabilization is not working
2. Battery is draining up within 1hrs of video recording.
3. Noise cancellation and Audio quality is poor.
4. not at all value for money.

Don't waste your hard-earned money on this product.",1
Today is the first day I brought camera for outdoor shooting and noticed the colour video is so dull. My S9 was shooting better. Then I looked close the lenses. Inside the lense some colour patches are observed and a piece of dust is also there. I did not expect such a bad quality product from Sony,1
Waiting from the day of the launch. Really an amazing camera. Recently started a vlogging channel and it's better than gopro and my osmo action. Thanks sony.,5
Wonderful camera. Used for live streaming and vlogging. it's perfect.,5
"No doubt this camera is producing some super amazing video and pictures. Sony has lived upto his reputation and name with this.
There are few things I wish they need to improve on immediate effect in next version.
1) Microphone needs improvement so much noise comes in have to buy additional accessories to cut down noise
2) Battery 🔋 can't even hold a month if not using. Once I charge the device to full capacity it doesn't last a month on stand by. In case of emergency shoot it is not a good companion
3) Bag to hold camera and gear
4) Price if possible as I had to spend 10000 to get a microphone
5) Little rugged and waterproof so that I can ditch my go pro and carry this all alone",4
"i bought this sony zv1 few weeks ago. i have not been using it much since i am down with covid 19. However, on few indoor usage there is a line scratch on the lens. I checked out several youtube video on this camera to find out if this is normal. But nothing of this sort is found on any other camera. the scratch seems to have gotten when the lens pushes out and pulls in when the camera is turn on and off. So, how do i exchange this camera for a new one? Thank you. Please help",3
"Best camera you can buy as a content creator!

I always confused between Canon m50 or Sony ZV1. Atleast choose the ZV1. Because of these resons,
1. Great Autofocus ( Very very useful. Sony cameras are very reliable)

2. Quality (Sony smashed Canon)

3. Less croped, usable 4k recording ( As compared to m50)

4. Low light capability (Much much better than m50)

5. Value for money ( I calculted overall cost to get the same things from M50, and it cost more than ZV1)

But, yes there have two major drawbacks,
1. Battery (Yes you'll get more battery life in m50 compared to ZV1)

2. 24mm lens ( I think 16mm is the best lens for vlogging and you can buy one for M50. For ZV1, yes it's 24mm is wide but not as much as you need for vlogging.)

Conclusion - If you need Quality, reliability and compactability just like me, this is the camera you need.

No other camera on the market can beat it in this price point.",5

No phone can match this camera clarity",5
"So i have been using this Beast For Almost 2 Months Now And Tbh Im Loving it Especially The AF Of This Camera is Really Awesome and the quality it gives is just amazing for a point and shoot camera almost directly comparable to DSLRs worth 100k+ inr
there is only 2 very minor issues that i suffered from
1;- battery life it does not long last if you do vlogging i would recommend you getting a extra battery
2;- lense is not interchangeable (the built in lense kit is good infact really awesome but interchangeable lenses gives a creator flexibility)",5
"Good light weight 4K camera. Good still photography as well excellent 4K videos too. Cons, sound is too less when watching the videos on camera and battery life is too bad, it comes with 2 batteries so you need to keep other one on charge when using for shots

Also I felt it is Little bit expensive for what it deserves. Price should be 8-10k less but overall it does the job, good autofocus and background defocus",4
"Received with a spare battery and 64gb memory card
I'm not a expert in camera
It's easy to take pictures and videos
But Need to upgrade your mobile /computer for 4k and HD videos

"ADVANTAGES:
Pocketable
Advanced video features

Poor battery life

"Everything thing is good,camera is very easy to use,quality is very good no problem,but the man problem is battery , battery is very poor only 1 hr backup for normal use ,and take 3 to 4 hr for charging it's very frustrating to change 4 hr and use only one hr.......",4
Very low noise. Superb colours from the Zeiss glass. Flippable screen. Records high quality audio. So light to carry and the sony tripod is excellent. The battery performance is pathetic. Taking out the SD cards is impossible to take out when fixed in stand. Takes poor photographs. If Sony addresses these issues they will have a perfect vlogging camera for us.,5
"Comes with a 64GB memory card
Amazing build
Awesome fast focusing
Perfect choice for a point and shoot camera in a mid-budget range
Better than Sony Rx 100
Zoom is not that good
Operates in manual mode
Love it overall",5
"Very good camera for vlogging, best AF in the business.
Very compact and light.
Very good video recording capabilities.
No phone sensor can beat this video quality.
Very good audio quality

Negatives:
But pricey
Battery life could have been better",4
It's just a digital camera. Not good for a video blogging in india. Also have an issue in the focus. Sometimes object goes out and get delayed for correct it back,1
now the price reduced by another 10000/-,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Ordered cam at the earliest. Tested its functionality, operating excellent. Pleased with the size and power packed in it. Only downside is ""had the lens covered wider""! Can manage with Ulanzi extended mt 08 tripod stick. Hope to enjoy vlog and travel.",5
"The camera works great and is good for amateurs, but the piece I got doesn’t have the 3.5mm mic jack working.. that’s a real downer :(

In the midst of this Covid situation it’s so difficult, now I have to visit the Sony centre to get it replaced",4
Wonderful camera for purpose,5
Awsm purchase.worth every penny.fullfilled my purpose.am a vlogger.its amazing to shoot & capture awsm pictures.lovely quality.thnq Amazon & sony .Highly recommend for vlogging & youtuber.But battery life is very low...it's sustains only for 30 min...for battery I ll give 3*,5
"Sony claims that we can record up to 45 minutes, but that's not true. Battery is getting exhausted in max 20 minutes of usage.",3
"Cons:
Poor battery life.
4K recording limit : 5mins
Automatic shuts down shooting when camera gets high temperature.
Not wide enough.

Pros:
High Quality Images and Videos.
Easy to use.
Light weight. 290gms
Smaller than my smartphone.
Nice audio recording. Better than Rode Shotgun mic.
Natural skin tones.",5
"Sony zv-1 is really great. I am totally satisfied this product. It's really good Camera for vlogger. Go for it..

Okay..... But need to Study more.,4
Nice,5
"Most of the things in this camera is fantastic, one thing I hate about this camera is the battery life. You will need to carry many batteries if you want to get through the day.",5
Too expensive for the type of usage it supports. Better to look for other products. The previous alpha series is still something good to buy.,2
Iam a youtuber and this camera makes my vlogging easier. The in built microphone record your voice clearly even in crowd. The 4k vlogging camera is perfect for content creation. we can also use the flip screen and video eye AF. It is very easy to share videos. the quality is wonderful. This camera is perfect for you.,5
"This is my dream camera. I haven't bought it till now. But I will. I am working on it. Basically I am a technology freak, gadgets freak. So after giving so much time, asking so many people, researching so many times, I have come to this conclusion that I will buy this camera. I will definitely post another review with pictures after I buy it. If you are also searching for a vlogging camera then please go for it. It is beginner friendly.",5
to tell the truth this product is not for professional shooting like really professional but excellent other wise if you are a beginner or a short video on the go producer it is the bomb!!!!,5
Best vlogging camera for professional vloggers. And the feature are really awesome.,5
"Love this camera using this for my youtube videos

Best,5
"Best prodct, amizin send amazon product, picture volaty nice a to z nice better life carge and valu is middiam",4
"Very nice camera for vloggers who needs a point and shoot camera and doesn’t wanna carry a DSLR. It enables you to shoot in 4k however battery life is poor. That means you need to carry 2-5 extra batteries if you’re a serious vlogger. However you can also buy 2-3000mah power bank/battery pack. Don’t blame the poor battery life cuz camera is so compact hence you have to compromise. 1hour of 4k shooting is good enough and if you need more carry extra batteries.
Sony never failed to impress me with pic and video quality. It’s a very good camera. Go for it, it’s handy, small.",5
"Got the set 1. Camera body 2. Kit lens 18-55mm VR 3. Kit lens 70-300 mm for Rs 33.5k. The camera sensor has exceptional imaging quality. I'm new to DSLR. It has been giving a true artistic expression of reality, which even a best quality phone camera can never do. Best camera for those who while pursuing photo clicking have come to know the limitations of a phone camera. See the pictures I have taken with and enjoy

Thank you Jeff and Co. for trustworthy, timely and secure delivery.",5
"Picture quality- Awesome, better purchase and see for yourself. Nikon basically is for stunning colours as the same colour vivid ness you can't find in any of the Canon DSLRs untill and unless they are full frame models.

Battery life- Avg. Usage of 2hrs every day gave the battery power running continuous for 3 days to me.

Durability- Here I have to mention that as it's a entry level DSLR. My suggestion go for it. Why? Let me explain

i. The grip on this is DSLR is almost like a professional cameras. Just go to shop and physically feel the grip. You'll love it. And do compare with other cameras also if I am no wrong.

ii. And for sure I have to say it's not weather resistant. According to me if you have 70 plus thousand rupees definitely go for weather sealed body full frame DSLRs. If not then grab this NIKON D3500 (An advanced model of 3400) released in the month of June 2018.

Lastly don't think whether to choose the entry level or professional camera. My suggestion a person should be enough patience to buy entry level first, because an entry level itself has a lots of menu options where you'll learn a lots of things. And after the completion of every option and one think Iam a professional person then go for a full frame DSLRs which costs around 1 to 1.5 lakh. My suggestion in that case would be NIKON D500 or CANON 6D Mark II.

Pls don't go for intermediate or Mid level cameras. Go basic level learn, experiment, go to field, study, repeat daily by varying different options, like ISO aperture and shutter speed, make yourself professional and then earn a very very good camera.

Thank you",4
"With max ISO 25600 you will get a better control over low light shots, than similar beginner-level Cannon models.

I chose this camera over Cannon 1500D because I heard a lot of critic reviews, and all of them were recommending Nikon.

The camera has a good grip, and doesn't much weigh, so you can easily take shots with one hand.

Most people have complained about no WiFi. I haven't missed that feature much. Because, I will not have a WiFi while taking shots outside. I can easily transfer the pictures to my computer using the SD card reader.

The camera doesn't have geo-tagging feature. But you can easily pair the SnapBridge App with the camera, and it will use phone's location and use it for geo-tagging. I really liked it.

Overall the camera is great.

Things I missed:

- It has a fixed display. Would have been great if it rotated.

P.S. I got all the items from Amazon, the Camera body, lens, bag and a 16GB SD card.",5
Just Awesome,5
"All the accessories/necessary part of camera is not genuine.
I got this dslr within two days of ordering it. It went well till the returnable period. Then suddenly I found both battery and charger defective. Defective Battery is not charging with the defective charger.
Apart from that, the USB cable required to transfer photos in laptop/desktop is also not in the box.
Want it to be replaced.
Its a trust issue. Hopeless with Amazon.",1
"SD Card missing from the kit. Apart from that, the USB cable required to transfer photos in laptop/desktop is also not in the box. Want it to be replaced.",1
"Awesome camera... excellent ""picture quality""..u should buy this product d3500.. don't go for d3400..I give guarantee buy Nikon d3500😍..also don't go for Canon...waste of money...Nikon is best and less price with high specifications",5
"This is worth for Rs.33500 after offers. I bought it mainly for taking picture of my kid who is so fast and mobile can't capture his activities. This very well survived the purpose. Picture quality is great and I am still exploring the 2 lens as a beginner.

Only downside is that Bluetooth Transfer is useless as it takes 5 min to copy 8mb file and the battery drained when I tried copying 100 photos. You can use your mobile USB cable to Copy your files but this shouldn't stop you from choosing it.
Go for it.",5
I got it for 24k in offer and believe me its a no brainer just go for it in this price no canon camera is equal to it lov d it and buyed 50mm prime lens and my kit is complete now. Fine quality with super fine pics.,5
"This is my first DSLR. I am very happy about this performance and picture quality. . This camera very easy to use. No need to join workshop . Just see video on YouTube. You will get everything knowledge. Very easy to shoot picture on different mode. I feel myself like professional photographer. . And thanks Amazon for before time delivery great packing. Trustful product. No need to think that online shopping is not trustful. It's wrong. All documents , manual and warranty card inside. I registered my product on Nikon website also",5
"I was very afraid 😨, that do u get a genuine product or not... Once 1 received and opened it I found.... yes... its great all the item where present their thing where there like memory card battery warranty card camera.. of course.. with other item like bag..
yes one can buy.... no problem",5
"Product not working as expectation yes the qualilty of product is good... but the amazon disappointed us because they showing in his website the product is available with the connectivity facility in the product with NFC, WIFi, and bluetooth. But the real product is not having with any type of wifi and nfc...... only bluetooth facility available in it......",2
SD card is not in the packet as shown while I was placing the order. And also carry case was not there.,1
"Nikons latest one of the D series.
Snapbridge is present and can be operated via Bluetooth only. (Pics transfer is very late via snapbridge because of only Bluetooth and no WiFi). I use snapbridge mostly for remote photos. Picture quality is great. I recommend",4
"I love my new camera ""D3500""... Picture quality and every bit of this DSLR is very good and upto the mark on this price range of DSLRs. Low light photography is not soo bad but I would suggest not increasing the ISO above 3200 as it leads to noisy pictures.
Today lots of phones have good camera and click very good pictures but not as good as the DSLRs if used properly. Explore your talents and imagination... HAPPY CLICKING!!",5
Pictures are really good..read many reviews and between cannon and nikon decided to go for Nikon...easy to use...dont have in depth knowledge about camera since I am a beginner but its definitely better than any phone's camera...checkout the picture I have attached,5
In this product box memory card and black case cover are missing. So pls place all orders carefully,1
16 GB (Class 10) SD card was not givem with the product....,1
"You can buy this with your eyes closed and be assured of a great deal. It is truly an advanced camera for the beginners as well as the professionals alike. I am an amateur and this must be my 10th camera including the 7th digital one. It feels great to hold it in the hand. Non-slippery ergonomic and beautiful body with all the controls adequately spaced and close to each other by moving the fingers slightly. Whether you use manual or automatic, or you wish to click jpeg or RAW, pictures are just great. You have a choice of optimizing your picture quality and fineness. Focusing is great. Additional manual focus ring besides the automatic is a boon. Viewfinder is great. Shutter release focusing as well as clicking is smooth and fast. Processing to write the images is superfast. Camera adjustments are easy and versatile for the beginner or the advanced user. If you are new, you can be well guided into photographing. What more you need, great pictures, done at ease with or without applying your mind. Depends, how you wish it to use it, it would stand by you like a good camera. Buy it with your eyes closed and enjoy the pictures you wish to take.",5
"The cameranis an amazing one especially for beginners. Amazing picture quality, easy to handle and compact. Got 16 gb memory card with the camera. For professional photography, go for a higher option. D3500 is an excellent one to use as a family camera. Can transfer photographs to laptop or computer via normal android phone cable. Eveeything is superb at this price range. The camera bag is also good one.",5
"All over it is good,
But i have issue with battery as per description it is not so long lasting and secondly the body get more hotter then it should be i think the product is good but with the problem of battery it make the product bad according to my knowledge the bettery is defective.",3
"So many of us will ready to buy this, because of this product has NFC and WIFI. Once you buy and realize there is NO wifi and NFC you will definitely disappointed.

I always believe amazon and it will provide allow and provide trusted information about product but it fails becuase of this product descriptions.",3
"I have watched a lot of review videos on youtube and other sites, that's what I usually do before buyig any major product. First of all Nikon 3500 is my first dslr, and I am quite surprised by its picture quality and Easy User interface. So if you are a new dslr user or if it is your first dlsr you can Buy it without any second thought. This is one of the best cameras in this price range. And trust me you won't be disappointed. I don't usually write reviews, but I had to this time I am very happy with this purchase. And as uasuall Amazon never disappoint me with its packing and delivery. All in all 5 star.",5
"Got this Camera today and was it well packed, thank you, Amazon for the neat package. Recieved all the items for this camera. Kept it for a first charge and waiting it to complete charge before exploring the world of DSLR. I feel good about this. I Will post usage review in a week or two. Am I satisfied now? I am pumped. Have fun guys.",5
Cannot take video more than 5 minutes the screen becomes white in cooler by itself which prevents me from seeing what is being captured on camera. It’s a fake DSLR Nikon camera.,1
"I purchased it along with set of 2 lens.
Autofocus works well actually but in a complex scenario it finds itself difficult to focus(very rare condition).
Colour contrast and reproduction of images is good comparatively in this price range.
Go for it only if you are an amateur to photography, although it nikon has tried to improve its old features and fit a bit new, but still I find some more features must have been added for beginners like retractable screen, increased image size and quality (last picture size u can get is 6000*4000, not more than that).
As there is a saying, smooth sea never makes a good sailor, hopefully full featured camera may not make the best photographer unless we know to explore the full potential of this camera.
I know people who shot awesome photos in mobile camera rather some people struggle for same composition in dslr.
Slightly there's a bit lag in image preview, like 2-3 sec after every image u click, hv to wait untill it loads.
Battery backup is pretty awesome, lasts longer than others in this price range.
No shortcut iso button which makes bit lesser competitive because when you shoot in manual mode u can't get the constant light condition in evry direction, except auto iso can help, but it won't give the required effects u need if you can't manually adjust it really quick.
Inbuilt image editing options are explorable and work quite well
Effects in dial are pretty good, overall I feel nikon has user-friendly operating system.
Those moon photos were taken using 300mm lens in manual mode with exposure being in negative column, then retouched in Photoshop cc.
Hope you'll make your decision and think on your purchase.",4
"Back when i was a kid all i had the family SLR film camera to play with. Though I was mostly fascinated with the gadget and never really got any good at photography. Having given up on taking photos for well over a decade i decided to give it another go. After surveying the various available camera types and models in the market i narrowed on this one. I have to say i am thoroughly impressed with the convinience, features and not mention cost-effectiveness of digital photography compared to film! And the image quality is just great. The ability to capture FHD video is a bonus. Worth every paisa.",5
"My first day of any camera -
Getting to know the features. It works wonder for the nature photography . Lets see how it goes for the rest of it.. till now best for the nature photography . I want to use it for the vlogging for my pet and his pics are still difficult to capture.
Con- doesnot have a wifi option ..so need to get a cable or a sd Card reader or a cable to tranfer the images and the bluetooth doesnot work to tranfer videos just the transfer of images is possible.
I am having thoughts to get one with the wifi. Or should I wait.",3
"Battery backup is insane, picture quality is awesome, built quality is good. Perfect start for beginner photographers. If you want to take some more awesome lowlight shots buy a Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G lens separately that will take your game to the another level.
Loving the camera already with the kit lenses.",5
"This is the right DSLR for beginners. If you learn some basic techniques you can click amazing shots with D3500. I got a well packaged camera in two days for decent Rs. 26500.( cheaper than dealer’s price) When combined with Capture NXD free download, Power of RAW files can be put to use. 18-55 mm lens is not a great one, but is a good starting point. Having learnt some basics I miss the ability of the camera to shoot at high aperture. Unfortunately the kit lens does not go beyond f/5.6 in M mode ( and I look forward to add a f/2.8 prime 50 mm soon). However lenses can be purchased for a bargain from dealers directly.
After theee months of usage : Have shot some awesome images with silhoutte. As I learnt more about photography I realise it’s 70 % of how you use the camera settings and the rest is about the lens.",4
"It is the best beginner level dslr you can get right now in this price range.it is best in photography,and still videos in this price range.it did pretty well in every photo types, focous problem was there during shooting flying birds ,but again it also depends on lens used.in maximum number of time it did great.if you want to explore it's full potential then do switch to manual control as soon as possible.any camera will do fine with good lens,just invest more on lens.you will be fine with this camera
Do Visit my insta for pics with this cam - @r_a_z_o_r_i_n_e",5
"A very good and quality product- Nikon dslr D3500 Camera. For beginners it is need to read the manual carefully and also must be educated in Exposure Trio means Shutter speed,Aperture and ISO to click manually. Everything is good but should have a shortcut key for ISO adjustment. I got the product in 28k with 18-55mm kit lens. It maybe 2k less in price compare to camera shops. I am rating giving you 4 stars. It's ok. I preferred Amazon. Thanks.",4
"Product was not so good.
I bought it in November 2019,
But now my nikon dslr has so many problems.
Like its screen issue, and also the camera..its completely shut down.I really didnot expect that from amazon and nikon .",3
"Hello All,

Before I start writing my review, first of all, I would like to send thanks to Amazon and the seller ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"" for their amazing 5***** service and providing me this top-notch product.

I finally received my Camera #Nikon D3500 D that I ordered on 7th June 2020 with Kit lens 18-55mm VR and 70-300 mm .

In order to cut long review short (In a nutshell)-

1. Awesome machine for capturing memorable moments - specially who are beginners and are planning to buy a new camera to start but getting confused - I would not say much - just look at the shots that I took and uploaded here from my camera and you yourself will come to know what I am trying to say as there is a saying ""A Pictures Speaks Thousand of Words"" (Please note- all of these uploaded pictures have taken from its kit lenses itself - I didn't use any prime lens for these blurry effects).

2. I don't want to go deeper into the technicality here - I would simply recommend all to buy this camera if you are specially looking to have your Camera for general photography purpose - not for commercial use. For Day to Day photography - it's A Jack Of All Trades!

3. Easy to handle 5/5

4. Picture Quality/Sharpness wise - 5/5 :)

5. For Beginners - just start with these two lenses first as this is fine enough - but down the line if you feel then go for other lenses such as Prime 50mm.

6. Try to shot via Manual Mode/A/S/P Only (An advise for beginner only) - First start with the Auto Mode - Learn & Experience it, then go with the advanced level then you will enjoy the true performance of the machine :)

At last, I would like to end by saying - Don't confuse with any other machine especially when planning to buy a beginner level camera - buy it with closed eyes :)

Thanks,
Parikshit",5
"Best for beginners and medium level photographers. The telephoto lens is awesome. Other kit 18-55 lens is very basic, gives you nothing. Go for purchasing a prime lens if you can.

Picture quality and colour reproduction is very good. Though focussing is an issue.",4
Good camera for the beginner like me. This is my first Dslr camera and I am very satisfied with the performance of this camera. Picture quality is excellent and the battery performance is superb. But sometimes this camera hangs if you are taking pictures very quickly shot after shot. So you need to stop for few seconds before taking new shot. Pictures are good but it should be more vivid.,4
"The best camera in this price range..
Picture quality is awesome ...
Deal of 70-300 lens is very affordable...
Bettery backup is really awesome 1500-1600 shots per charging.....dont think much go blindly.",5
The DSLR cameras come with an advantage because they have a lens with variable focal length and aperture. It allows them to regulate the amount of light that enters the camera thereby ensuring images of better quality. Smartphone cameras have autofocusing lenses. They can be slow at times and experience shutter lag.,5
"This camera is really handy and good for beginners. The packing also had carry bag which
was unexpected. The packing should have been better as the main box was not fitted to hold the D3500 box firmly and I think it came wobbling from packing to delivery. Luckily the D3500 box had all Camera items in slots with good fit. Good to buy one more battery if you travel or click regular pics.",5
Its simply amazing.. better than d3400,5
"I will not provide any too high information here. Buying this camera i hope you are a beginner in photography or dslr .this product you have to buy a lot more accesories if interested in mannual mode. Auto mode requires nothing just press the shutter !
Please do follow @hikewithabhijeet on instagram for magic this device can do if operated mannually!",5
"Only DSLR can beat the Phone Camera.
I experienced with it above the expectations. This is my first experince with DSLR, Fast delivery within 3 days only. Got all the items in Box as listed in list.The quality of the Body and Lances are really awesome, even picture quality.
Very good product for Beginners & Propesaionals.
Totaly worth the cost",5
"One of the best DSLR for the beginner photographers. Trust me, you can buy an expensive camera but untill you know how to use it, it is worthless. So, Nikon D3500 gives you the best results and worth buying.

Never forget- It is never about the camera, it's about the skills. Polish your skills, get yourself this beast and explore :)

Happy Clicking :)",5
"The nikon camera is worth buying for the beginners at this price range. I would suggest If you want to have dslr like image quality and low light photography then you have to purchase 35mm or 50 mm fast lenses at least. As shown in the description, the devise is not wifi/NFC enabled. However bluetooth connectivity and mini hdmi ports are available.",5
"For beginners this is best camera and if you have some money always prefer to take 70-300mm lens to enjoy more power of this device....
Battery backup is just awsome....change once and go for trip it will do it duty very well......

Learn about manual adjustment of this camera and ypu will rock....
Pros:
Battery
Price
Built quality

Cons:
Only 11 focus points are present.,..",5
"Don't know much about DSLRs. It's my first time using one & I'm damn happy. I feel the colour capture is amazing. Buttons, dials, locks, clicks are all perfect. Feels premium enough & great in hand. Build quality is amazing. I'll definately recommend to others.",5
"Best camera for beginners.best outdoor pictures.the lens is too good for long range shots.can capture moving objects with the maximum shutter speed of 1/4000.for beginners, also buy cleaning kit with camera other wise there is a chance of fungal growth.its picture quality is really good than canon.but it has only Bluetooth connectivity no wifi.so it takes more time to transfer the photos.it has good battery backup also takes few more time to charge",4
"The camera build quality is super and very great for bigners also battry bakup is awsome u can click upto 1500 shots.

Picture quality 10/10
Video quality. 8/10
Focusing. 7/10
Battery. 10/10

If you are a normal photographer then this is for you
I have using for video
Awsome product by amazon",5
"Amazon cheating customers telling that d3500 having wifi, nfc too but it is having only blutooth. Rest of the features are good, this dslr is for entry level photographers, i like it and u should buy dual lens... As buying lenses separtely is expensive.",1
One of the best DSLR camera for beginners. Great and innovative guide on how to take perfect photos. I'm enjoying with the purchase.,5
"Its good product, i got it with missed parts..latter i they replaced with new one..Thanks",4
"Value for money. I got it for 28k. The pictures are really awesome even in low light conditions.
The kit lens is almost okay.
For getting more bokeh just go for the prime lenses.",5
"If you are beginner than this DSLR is awsum.
Easy to use and carry.
All features are good.
Easily connected to mobile also via its app and all images got imported easily.
Overall experince 10 out of 10.
If you want to buy this DSLR dont hesitate to buy it just buy and experince it.",5
I bought this in 2019 and have been using it since. The camera is very good but it does not have a touch screen so still have to manage with the buttons but that's not much of a hassle. The pictures come quite good of you know what you're doing. I bought both the lenses but you don't need to buy both as you would rarely be using the 70mm lens. Overall a good product. Recommended!,5
I really liked the way Amazon delivered the product by securing end to end of the camera box but even though the cable which usually comes with cameras aren't present in the box (like HDMI cable ) the camera and lenses performed very well indeed the delivery was quick and trackable thus I conclude by saying Amazon did a great job,4
"If you are a beginner,then Nikon D3500 is the best choice for you in this price.The picture quality is stunning and both the lenses are damn good.The battery life is impressive too.It takes 1.5 -2hrs to get fully charged.",4
"As a beginner I bought this cam on my b'day with lots of confusion as I don't know nothing about dslr and now I'm in love with this product, I would like to thank Amazon for their amazing delivery as usual, Definitely a great cam for beginners I've learned lot from the cam itself as it has built-in guide feature and it has some filters, modes and so on...

My rating - 11/10🔥",5
"The camera is well beyond my expectations. Quite light in weight and operations are very smooth. I got two lenses too, including the 70-300mm lense, for a total price of about Rs 35,000. Very affordable price.",5
"Thank you Amazon.. I was waiting for long time and finally I got for just 21K after using SBI debit card 😍... About performance 🤔.. Brand name is enough, it says lot.. best picture quality and build quality too.. you will love guys don't think just go for it..",5
"Brought it as a gift for my love during great festival sale. She wants to learn photography and I believe this is the best DSLR for entry level photographers. She is loving it.....Thanks to Amazon....The product was well-packed, no any issues in the product body and it works fantastic!!!👍😃",5
"The camera is not good, please don't buy it, Amazon is giving bad products nowadays
I think they gave a returned product. Please be careful, I have stoped bying products from AMAZON after this, they didn't want to return the camera back, it was a 46000 loss for me",1
Camera Screen is defective.... I received all items I ordered for and when I assembled all parts and turn on the camera Screen was found defective ..... Now returning this product,1
Nice camera for beginners go for it but do purchase in offers like great Indian sale you will get huge price drop upto 23k,5
I'm a newbie with DSLR cameras but loved this piece as its not at all complicated. Amazing entry level DSLR. Functions are pretty easy to understand. Timely delivery by Amazon. Go for it.,5
"Unable to charge the battery with the defective charger within 3 months of purchase.
Thereby the camera has become useless without the charger
No response from the dealers and service centers while enquiring about the complaint",1
"Excellent!!! Must buy... In budget...+ Original Product..+ Fast Delivery + Premium Quality + ... no words to say...
Writing this review after using Nikon Camera for 2 Months
Guys...Just go for it...! Recommend dont scroll down for another review... believe just go for it... 10/10*.",5
The picture quality is very good in day light Bt struggles a bit under low light.. Shutter is responsive and snap bridge official app of nikon works cool.... Auto focus is bit unaccuate given 11 focus points.... Bt can't expect more from entry level camera and kit lens.. . Overall happy with the product,4
Not good,1
It's my first camera purchase and use. The pictures I took are attached for reference. They are not in original quality here but truly they are fantastic. I rate this camera pretty good for beginner but it's a feedback coming from a person who hasn't used any other camera before. So beware before you take this review for granted.,5
"I could not find the camera inside the box. The box was just a camera bag,Apart from this, nothing related to the camera was found inside the box",1
"Nikon 3500 is the first DSLR I bought and I have no regrets. It produces such an awesome result, I click photos from my phone also, but the quality which a DSLR gives, a phone can never give. I am using it for the past 6 months and never found an issue. I am totally satisfied with this camera and I highly recommend it. Both the lenses are good, I personally like the pictures clicked from 70-300mm. Depends on the object you want to capture, both produce great results. 5/5.",5
"Good camera for beginners. Great ISO control, good auto mode. A bit expensive for the give fratures it has, but still, makes up for low light pics. Very low noise compared to canon 1300/1500D. Compact size and easy to handle. One of the better choices in budget DSLR in india right now.",4
Camera Bag is not good.,1
"Came without battery and then the entire return process was a nightmare.

Finally it all happened after some escalations.",1
"Easy to use. Lightweight. Came properly packed.
Just make sure the SD card is packed properly. It was stuck under the box on the plastic. Could have thrown it away by mistake.",5
"Ease of use
Nature photography
Bundled offer of camera plus 70-300 Telephotolense is great value for money",5
"Trying to develop photography as a hobby, I feel it is a good buy for beginners, myself being one.
Thanks to Amazon for it's offer, I purchased the item for around 24k rupees.
All the items and accessories mentioned in the product details were packed and delivered neatly.",5
"This is a perfect dslr for entry level photographers. We have all the basic controls and can also achieve great pictures using the product. If you have an hight budget, do go for Nikon D5300 or above, it will definitely help you.",5
Great camera all items with product i received which seller promised the camera is better than canon 1500d in future i am going to buy lens thank you appario Ltd and amazon.,5
The product is good and i have recieved all the accessories as mentioned. Thank you.,5
"Auto focus is good but not so great. This does not means its bad. It works well. As beginner its good. But once u r used to it, u will find it bit boring as ur requirement from a DSLR will be higher. If u r beginner, blindly go for it, or else go for some higher version",5
It's very good entry level camera for beginners. It does the job. Picture qualities are good. If you are buying for video shooting then get a stand too to avoid video shaking.,5
I didn't receive cable to transfer data from camera to laptop,3
SD card is not with the package . feel cheated,1
Display is not working within 2 month. No one is responding to fix the issue. Need help.,1
"Its good for a beginner with little cost add-ons. but you can go for 3400 too. It is less rate and almost wiyh same configs.

They should provide lens hood when they are charging this much for product.",5
"Very good product for the beginners.
Best battery performance ( if you use the viewfinder) (I left it on for a week😅 and it works )
Kit lenses does it job good (it don't have auto and manual change button)
Ultimately its upto the user and there skills.",5
"Good product for beginners. Have been using it for almost 8 months now. Focus and apparatus is very nice.
The beginners can learn & handle it easily.",5
"Best ever camera, i am having DSLR for 1st time still got to know all thongs easily and really best camera in all these price segment, loved it ❤️ thanks Amazon

cons: no wifi only bluetooth option is available still no worrying they have awesome snapbridge application we can use it for direct downloading images.",5
"Nice camera, good battery backup, but when I put the zoom lens its take some time to auto focus on the object. Otherwise a good 4 star product. Best in its range for beginners.",4
I ordered the 2 lense bundle and the 300mm lense was not included . I’ve asked for an exchange hopefully it’s included this time,1
I purchased this priduct but unfortunate battery not working more that 20 min. I am not able to contact customer care also. Please replace the product or refund my amount.,1
"One of the best entry level DSLRs. Got this with the kit lens as well as the 70-300mm telephoto lens. Was able to take a pic of the Milky Way even with some light pollution. Excellent depth of field. Only one problem is that sharing of files over WiFi is not available. Otherwise, an excellent DSLR.",5
I got it delivered on time as expected. Nice & very handy product. Pictures of 50-300 mm lens is awesome. Happy to use it. But got a currepted SD card. Unable to use & format it even with comond promt. Rest all ok. Thanks Amazon,5
I bought new product but battery along with it faulty so called customer care but they denied for battery replacement of brand new camera they said return it pathetic service Nikon,1
Quality is not good...,1
"1. Best for beginners.
2. Nice night photography.
3. Long exposure - upto 30sec
4 . No external mic for recording.

I bought it over canon 1500d.",5
The camera is good for beginners but the memory card that I was provided was not working and frequently got corrupted. Otherwise the camera is good. Sturdy and stable and gives good quality pictures. Only negative is fixed screen but when you use more of view finder it doesn’t really matter always,5
Display screen blacked out after 5 days. Then a long lockdown and no service centre nearby.,2
"A thin ring around the 70-300mm lens got peeled off after a few days, even with very careful handling and usage.",1
Its just a basic cam better go for little bit more expensive one this is a very limited camara just like digital cam.,3
sd card and usb cable missing from the pack.,2
"The picture clarity is good and video recording is also in HD quality , the price of camera is bit high but worth for the quality of picture . Battery perspective could have been given more and when we need to take the pictures in large lense the battery drains very fast overall the I would rate 4 out of 5 for this product",4
For beginners it's very good camera. Make sure you buy 75-300 lens for best photo shoot. Cons: Transfer of data should be WiFi but still it's in Bluetooth platform. Latency in data transfer even though their app.,5
I bought this by my sbi credit card but no cashback offer for this purchase. Reliance digital offered 30500 rs.,3
"Nothing to say really, does the job like nothing else in the range. Know the basic stuff atleast before getting one, it won't disappoint.",5
Good Picture quality and Nice product for basic DSLR and Easy to share photos from DSLR to Mobiles using Snapdragon and Zooming lens was awesome Video recording also very nice I bought the best price 33400-00 In Amazon great Indian sale But one bad thing is no WiFi option in this camera.,5
"It's a Best DSLR entery level camera for beginners. Easy to use, user friendly interface. Try and test in different modes of operation other than Auto.

Disappointed because Amazon reduced 1700/- rupess after 2 days of my purchase.",4
"Got this camera set in just 31999 during the sale,at this price point it is a marvelous camera the best part is picture quality,battery,compactness....",5
"Best for beginners & lovely point n shoot for closer pictures, potraits",5
"I had experienced with this cam, was awesome.. Value for money, but audio jack not available, and if you are thinking for the video recording then don't buy this...",5
it's costly now before it was 26500/- and I bought at 32500/- price,5
Good as First Camera. Need to learn a lot of things before I could comment about it. Seems ok but frankly speaking phones with good cameras turn out to be quick and hassle free these days.,5
"Best for beginners and better than canon 1500D..
Fallin in love😙😍 with it..
Really awesome..",5
"Yes, as far as the beginner goes, the camera is perfect for them",4
"3 star for Camera quality which is good, but Camera does not have WiFi and NFC connectivity, Amazon is making fool customers by mentioning WiFi and NFC over product description.. no issues with picture quality but atleast they have to mention real things.. Really Disappointed with Amazon this time",3
"I am not a professional, but this DsLR has a lot to do. If you want to be a professional in a lower to spend, you must go for this D3500 beast. Excellent for photography, not much satisfied with video-shoots. Amazing buy.",5
"Value for Money. Beginners can start photography in Auto mode. Once you are comfortable you can learn Manual mode from Nikon school website or from YouTube.
Photo size is 5-6 mb.",5
"1) Delivery by Amazon: Before expected arrival
2) Product review: Good for beginners, too many modes and settings to learn. One can learn to get better exposure triangle.
Even i am new but learnt few things through youtube.",4
"This is my first dslr camera . So far so good.
I m learning photography.
Thanks to Amazon for giving me this camara for good price. It was far more expensive on other sites and local camara dealers.",4
"It's been two years 😍😍😍.... Battery backup is perfect. Lot of memories captured.

Ps: Purchase with Zoom lens 🙌🙌🙌",5
"One of the best for beginners and I recommended this for few of my friends. As you improve, no need to buy another camera, a different lens is enough.",5
"It is OK for beginners but the functions are too complicated, by the time to change your settings, it is possible that the object you want to click might have moved.",3
Good product.. battery is nice work.,4
Best one for beginners from Nikon... loved the product... Delivered on time... Value for money... Clarity is so good... Packaged so well... Worthful one #Nikond3500,5
Best for the price .,5
"This is a entry level camera and it does all the basic stuff smoothly, don't expect much from this camera or you will be disappointed. Solid build and strong body. The camera is good for one who are starting their passion/career in photography.",4
"For beginners it's awesome to use and we can learn how to take a perfect snaps
Picture quality ok battery backup also gud..",4
Perfect dslr for beginners.picture quality is nice.can do fast auto focusing.performs well in low light conditions. Light weight.nice grip.if we know adjusting manual mod it feels better than auto mode.overall it s a nice product,4
SD card is missing in packet,3
"As per the product details, Memory Card was not included. Its written in box also that 16Gb memory card included. But there was no memory card in the box.
Picture quality is awesome....",5
"Your search for the perfect beginner camera has come to an end. Go for it!
Buy the 70-300 lens as well.",5
"I'm return this product.
I'm got a defective product.
When i install battery. It's got very hit. that why I'm returned it. But camera is ok best for beginners
And it's picture quality is very good.",3
Not that much great as mentioned. for better results we have to buy other lenses which are more cost. Please don't expect much from camera.portrait was very bad.,3
Nice product for beginners. Only thing I would like to mention that it takes long to transfer pictures from DSLR to smartphone (via Bluetooth). No wi fi option.,5
"Boon for beginners like me...just go for it without any second thought...❤️
Picture quality is damn awesome...you have to play with settings and it’s enjoyable...more you play more will learn...Its just love...",5
"Camera is nice but price is high. I got it 28k from amazn.
I live in local city or else...
Main problem.",4
It's the go to for beginners. Overall a good experience and a lot to learn. But it's the start and you can start from here,4
"Best beginner dslr camera out there.
Buy some good lenses and you are good to go
Posting some pictures taken from nikon d3500.",4
The Camera Is Very Very Good & Item is very good Enough only give suggestion is if anybody buy any camera always buy with double lens combo pack bcoz it is very cheaper in rate & Have the best reasonable price u get.,5
Safe packing - received all seals intact company original pack- detail review will follow,4
"I bought this nikon d3500 dslr few days back and when i was registering myself on nikon site, the serial number shown as invalid.",4

Best camera in easy price good for biggners .,5
This product has been my dream come true. Loved the pics and can't wait to explore more of its features.,5

"The D3500 is simple to use, captures good pictures and is lightweight, so doesn't burden you.",4
Good,5
Writing review after using it for one year. It is amazing for beginner level photographer and for hobbyists,5
"Like: build quality
Dislike: since I am just a beginner, I cannot comment cons now",4
Nanba it is really superb. I purchased with two hearted. But its output gives me satisfaction,5
The camera is perfect for beginners. What I would recommend is to get a good prime lens if you want to take portraits because the kit lens is very basic.,5
Go for the two lens kit. 70-300mm is a must have 👍🏻,5
"I bought this product in June'19, and after 2 months of using it I can say that it's the best choice for beginners in this price segment The only one thing which I felt could have been improved a bit was it's battery life. It's pretty avg.",5
"Super, good option to connect directly mobile device. Fine",5
"Overall the best buy for entry level photographers. I should recommend Nikon to make way for adjustable self timers because there is only a 10s timer if it were adjustable, then we could have made it 5s or 3s etc.",5
"Seller described wifi, NFC and bluetooth (all inbuilt) for the connectivity but it only has Bluetooth and no wifi , no NFC present in camera.",4
Beginners can click mind blowing and absolutely fantastic images in Nikon D3500. It is too worth for its prices & the kit lenses are doing much better. Nikon D3500 will be a good companion for those who are fond of clicking the special moments & memories.,5
Features are awesome,5
Fabulous camera for beginners. No Mobile Phone can match the quality or details.,5
"Good DSLR for beginners .Great product for this money.Good packing , on time delivery and etc.",5

Good camera for family function and simple out door phooto shooting,5
Quality of the picture is very nice. Don't buy 48mp. Camera mobiles. Instead you can try this.,5
Nikon D3500 is a very good camera for beginners. I highly recommend them to go for it.... Picture quality is also good.,5
I am not satisfied with the quality of photos. They are just like what point and shoot cameras deluver.,4
"The battery is not up to my expectations...
But I love the product",5
Nice camera light weight easy to use. With 350mm lens u get nice close pics. Battery life ok. Picture quality with 18mm could have been better,5
Whole new dimension in photography for me,5
Company must provide manual in CD form and Videos in the CD that will help user to use with better precessions.,5
"Simply saying, Smartphones take better pictures. Go for it if you want to show-off a DSLR.",3
The camera is good and easy to use for beginners like me. However the manual should have been more details since D3500 is meant for beginners,5
SD card is missing from the package. I can't return it as I need this urgently. Do not expect SD card if you are ordering this,2

"I exchanged my Nikon d3200 for this and there are a lot of things that disappoints me about the camera as well as love it.

Is this worth an upgrade? Is this the best camera out there.

Today I will explain it to you in detail

Design and build

The build is solid like most Nikon camera, it is not very premium but what you get is a hard plastic well built compact DSLR camera that is super compact and very grippy to hold.

What disappointed me was how similar the design was to the old model, the design of the old camera was not bad, but this one has the same feel and buttons with few extra changes that are very pleasing.

You have a viewfinder toggle switch that feels very used compared to the button on the previous model, you also get an adjuster dialer which is designed a little better than the old one but performs just like the old one.

I felt Nikon could have changed the design a little bit for those upgrading to the newer model, everything works well here so I can live with this.

The camera is very compact and has the same battery holder and card holder design like the previous one, what I love about this camera is how compact it feels to hold in your hand and carry around, I am sure Nikon understand that this camera is for those who are entering the world of DSLRs and would want something that is easy to carry and simple to use and it does this gracefully.

Battery life and performance

What surprised me about this camera was the mammoth jump that it takes as far as battery life is concerned. The battery life on this is extraordinary. I was never discontent with the battery on the Nikon d3200 however, this one is on another dimension with a company claim of more than 1500 shots approx, the battery life on this has been extraordinary.

https://amzn.to/2AUj4Jn

I am not going to post a comparison review here because it will make the review very long. But both Cameras are great and have their own set of pros and cons.

Conclusion

A well-finished camera by the house of Nikon, it is compact has a fantastic battery life, easy to use and has a lot of options to add your fx and dx type of lens.

The camera is flawed by few updates which were required in the newer model, in the world of vlogging it simply disappoints with an absence of an articulating screen, the resolution of the screen does not impress either, but if you are a beginner and entering into DSLRs, you should definitely consider this and if you are not, and looking for a decent upgrade check this out

https://amzn.to/2U5GfYr

Pros

1.fantastic battery performance
2.fast snappy chipset
3.Nikon quality and build
4.very well priced, value for money deal
5.very compact, a joy to hold and easy to carry
6.well laid out controls that are all within your reach

Cons
1.display could have been better
2.Still no articulating screen
3. The app still needs to improve
4.not worth an upgrade from the older model

A very well made camera with good performance and battery life. One of the first DSLR I purchased with the 3200 and this one will be a decent first camera for you.

Hope my review helped 😊

Cheers",4
Nikon D5100 was so bad that I decided I would never buy a Nikon again. The auto focus was terrible. The image noise cancellation and high sensitivity performance was so bad. The LCD got damaged very quickly. The biggest problem was that it didn't have manual exposure settings in video. There was no option for grid overlay. The mic input was of no use as you couldn't control the sensitivity efficiently and the internals were poor quality. The file size of videos especially was too big but that could have been tolerated had they been anywhere near average quality. I tried ridiculously hard to get rid of it. Phew.,1
Nice product from Nikon..!!!,5
"Hi guys, I bought this camera last month.. For past 2 years, had a dream of buying dslr.. Finally I got it.. In Amazon, price is around 50k for kit lens plus 70-300mm lens, I bought it in near by showroom.. I got it for 41.5k... I asked showroom owner, he said due to demand the price is little bit more in Amazon..

Though I don't know anything about dslr, I had an interest in bird photography, so I'm learning basic things from nikon YouTube channel, and v2k photography, so I'm learning a lot..so if u r amateur like me.. Go for this camera, and learn things..",5
"This DSLR is good for beginners, i have bought it in Reliance digital for 45000/- including 18-55mm and 70-300mm lenses.
Picture quality is outstanding. U can record non-stop 30min video in low quality, 20min in medium quality, 10min in high quality.
Nikon D3500 is perfect choice for beginners, if are confused between Canon and Nikon, go for nikon undoubtedly.",4
"The cost shown in amazon for Nikon D3500 with AF-P DX Nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR in amazon was 44,999 but when you check same in other E-Commerce its 36,000 and even in nikon website is 37,000.
So be carefully before buying it",1
"You don't need to be a photographer to know a great photo when you see one. And you don't need to be a photographer to take a great photo you just need the D3500. It's as easy to use as a point-and-shoot, but it takes beautiful DSLR photos and videos that get noticed. It feels outstanding in your hands, sturdy and balanced with controls where you want them. It's compact, durable and versatile, ideal for travel. And it works seamlessly with compatible smartphones, making it easier than ever to share your great photos. Even if you've never picked up a DSLR camera, you can take beautiful pictures with D3500.",5

"The camera is good but it's missing some imp function, Cannot attach MIC and Cannot handle it remotely from a computer.

Its major drawback. Though is for beginners the cost is not for beginners.
I cannot shoot video from far because it will impact on the voice recording.

I recommend going for Canon or other companies where you get external mic port and which support remotely control from a computer.",1
Just over the moon that i got the camera with dual lenses for the meagre price of 28999. Thank you Amazon for the amazing offer. Desoerately waiting for the camera to arrive. Will update with pictures and more.,5

"I have a mi security camera already and I am using it since one year. After the lockdown, it went out of stock but soon arrived at Amazon but it's cost had increased. Even then I went ahead and tried to purchase it as I had prior confidence but just before buying Amazon showed me a feature comparison with this camera (tapo c200). So my review would be largely a comparison of the two with a breakup of the features of both security cameras.

On the feature front, this tapo camera beats mi security camera hands down. It comes with home monitoring, call/talk back feature just as mi security camera but additionally has privacy feature to switch off recording, alarm on/off on detection of movement, clean user interface, advanced self diagnosis feature, auto reboot feature and 128gb sdcard storage as against no privacy feature and 64gb in mi security camera. Also on detection of movement, mi security camera records multiple clips of max 1 min duration whereas tapo doesn't have that recording constraint. This is the biggest disadvantage of mi security camera. The setup took time as my WiFi was hidden and camera didn't recognize the hidden network even though I manually added it. But finally to overcome that, I made my WiFi network discoverable, once tapo recognized and stored it, I once again hid my WiFi and tapo didn't have any problem.

Aesthetics of tapo are however not that good as mi security camera. mi security camera feels premium when touched physically. However when you touch tapo, you get a cheap Chinese feeling which I hated when I opened the box. Moreover tapo rotates from its bottom and the rotating diameter is large. Mi security camera rotates from its middle point and the rotating diameter is consequently smaller.

Other than the rotating and aesthetics, tapo wins quite handsomely. If you want a premium feeling ( which no longer matters once the camera is setup) go for mi security camera otherwise go for tapo c200 and enjoy the rich features at a lesser price.

Will update more about its longevity in future.

Update1: After 3 months I realized that after inserting SD card, the initialisation time has increased by more than two minutes whereas in mi camera, the initialisation time hasn't noticeably changed. So mi camera wins here.

Update 2: Recording and browsing of recording in sd card in tapo is better but when tapo records any video on detection of any Movement, the green light of the camera turns to red. Also when night mode switches on, one can hear the relay sound from tapo easily. Mi camera continues to emit blue light even while recording and no relay sound comes out of Mi camera when night mode switches on. So Mi camera wins here again.

Update 3: in case of motion detection, mi camera takes an estimated 8-9 minutes to process the feed and send you a notification. That is, if a person/motion is detected at 8:00pm in front of camera, you will receive a notification only at 8:09 pm. In case of tapo, this is 4-5 minutes with a buzzer/alarm feature. Here Tapo wins down handsomely.

More updates in future",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The packaging of the camera was good. It was so easy to install it. Just plug in the Camera to 100-250 V and follow the instructions of app-TAPO. Few clicks and it is working. Plenty of options for privacy, Motion detection, and alerts and customized timings for motion detection/alerts. It will not work with Alexa Echo, but only with the Alexa Echo show. Recommended for home security cameras in this range.",4
The device goes offline like of a full day. Happened it on last 2 Sunday’s and today. Don’t know what is wrong . Internet and power supply is fine but the devise shows offline. Customer care number doesn’t respond or attend the call. Tried giving feedback thru the app. Even no response for that.,1
"This is really a very good Camera in this price. Beleive me I have tried all the Xiaomi, Yi and D3D Smart Wifi Cams and this I found one of the best option.

I am using these with Home Assistant and MotionEYE.
I have not inserted any SD card and using MotionEYE to directly record videos to my system.
The RTSP stream is in full hd 1080p and its really good. It loads instantly and delay is of few microseconds.
I am using 1080p feed over RTSP and 360p feed on the app so both the things can be used at the same time.
I have configured AI Face recognition using this camera to announce whoever is on my gate over my Google Home Mini and this is working really well with this cam.

Pros:
- Good Video Quality at 1080p and at Night
- Really loud speaker
- Camera Speaker can be used to trigger alarm sound
- They offer RTSP/ONVIF support for these camera which is a big deal
- Fast and Responsive App
- Ability to live view camera feed on any computer system

Cons:
Sometimes connectivity issue in the app but it can be fixed with the update.
No NAS support like Xiaomi Cameras, However I don't need it as RTSP is more then enough but having NAS support in app is a big bonus.",5
"I bought this for Rs 2500. My honest review on using this for 2 weeks.
1) It is one of the best camera at this budget. It provides 360' degree tilting from left to right and vice versa, also up and down view is available.
2) Clarity provides 1080 pixel, which you can't get in normal security camera especially at this budget(2500rs).
3) It doesn't record the idle position, and captures any small movements. It only records if there is a movement, which is a good feature. Also it provides constant notification for every movement. Even it is a small flies it captures that too and sends the notification to mobile.
4) You just need a wifi and power point.
5) Draw back is if someone steals the camera, then you can't see anything, because everything is recorder in camera's sd card.
Even if you switch off or it doesn't get wifi you can't view or download anything.
6) if you are placing this inside the gate then it is a good option.
7) another feature is it also records the voice.
8) I inserted 128 gb sd card on this.
My review is 5/5",5
"Good product by TP link. Tapo App is awesome and very quick, user friendly to configure and manage. Camera can be rotated from the App. Video Quality is reasonably good for the price we pay. I am Giving the review after 6months of usage.
Tapo is the best CCTV camera App that I ever used. One of the steady robust App. Awesome developers.
Overall worth buying with one year warranty",5
BOUGHT THE TP link for home use - the devise connected to the wifi but the camera didn't. We tried for tech support. 5 days - no response - they send us from one number to another. They neither solve the problem nor do they take back the product - worst experience ever. I needed two cameras so I bought the TP Link and another camera of Sricam make - that is working beautifully so its not that our wifi is not working or that we don't know how to set up. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GIVE 0 RATING TO THIS PRODUCT. Amazon also is not able to help us so as an online shopping site they have failed. totally bad experience.,1
"Update: The Tapo app absolutely sucks. Terrible app. Sometimes takes one or two minutes to get video from camera. Viewing recorded video footage is equally painful. You have to play the entire lenght of the video to record. Ridiculous! No option to simply get files from camera. Even trying to change camera settings is lethargic.
----

I will compare this camera with Mi Camera which I also own.

C100 supports ONVIF and RTSP. It makes the camera versatile. You can connect it with software/hardware NVRs. I hooked it up with MotionEyeOS running on a Raspberry Pi.
This was the reason why I bought this camera.
You can see all RTSP/ONVIF IP cameras in grid view from a computer/Android TV.

Mi cameras don't have ONVIF/RTSP support.
Mi camera can only be viewed from a phone app. (And chromecast+google displays which most people don't have.)
No PC software or even an Android TV app for Mi camera.
You can connect it to a NAS where camera automatically uploads original recordings periodically. Tapo cameras don't have this. (You can create a NAS from your PC/RaspberryPi etc.)

Tapo C100 over-saturates colors. Too much.
Mi camera does it too but not that bad.

Field of View of C100 is narrower than Mi camera.

When Night Vision (infrared lights) is on in Tapo, three red LEDs can be seen with naked eye. It does not have invisible LED infrared. It makes the camera visible, which is bad.

Tapo camera has two hooks on bottom to wall mount. Mi camera doesn't.

Google assistant support is there for both cameras. You can cast camera to google home display/Chromecast ultra device.

Build quality of Mi camera is better than Tapo C100.

If you are only going to use a phone app to view the camera, get the Mi camera.
If you need to see cameras on laptop, get Tapo.

In case, in future Mi cameras get RTSP/ONVIF support, no doubt get Mi.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Very good product. Connected it to router without internet connection. Now I'm able to watch live video on 3 phones connected to the same router. No data usage. Value for money. Love it. Bought one more of the same camera. Very satisfied with the quality.",5
"Been using this camera from the last two days and I have to say it is a wonderful device with all the features you'd except in this range.

The app is a little buggy but that is acceptable.

Picture quality is pretty clear and the night vision is really good.

The only thing I wished for is if the vertical FOV was a little wider.

Please note - The customer service provided by TPLINK is pure garbage as before purchasing this product, I called up the toll free number of TPLINK for asking about the warranty period and the executive was so confident that even before letting me complete my question, he said "" 3 Years warranty for Tapo C200 camera "". where as in amazon product page as well as the manufacturer box, it is written 1 year. I just hope I do not face any issues with the service center people atleast while the product is in warranty.

Overall - I am really happy with the product and can definitely recommend.",5
"Setup was easy. Worked flawlessly until I turned of the room lights. Night vision is dead & is not switching on. Tried resetting but had same issue with night mode not functioning. Color vision Quality is accepted but the product is presently useless as it is defective. Will post an update when I get a replacement.

2nd & 3rd units Review update:
The 1st unit's replacement is already on way & I'm glad for that. The other two units worked flawlessly without any issues I faced with night mode. TP-Link's Tapo app was good with a clean UI with ability to view upto 32 cameras just like a cctv system.

Pros:
Easy setup, 128Gb storage, No SD errors like problems i faced in Mi cameras. Ability to connect the cameras to a NVR system as ONVIF protocol IP cameras.

I added these cameras to my Synology DiskStation NAS system that has amazing surveillance station software that can beat any NVR systems available in india.

Motion detection was too sensitive, had to reduce the sensitivity & muted the notifications on the phone.

These are really good stable performing cameras. I can say these are very reliable for use as IP cameras.

I'm currently using six Tapo C100 Cameras. No issues faced except for my first order. I'll be purchasing more & am planning to expand these upto 24 cameras. Waiting for the C310 outdoor camera to launch.

October's end update: Using a total of 12 Tapo C100 & 2 Tapo C200 cameras with my Synology DS218+ DiskStation NAS system. Zero hiccups. Very stable performance all streaming at 1080p 15fps. Very happy with the Tapo series cameras. Will update here on long term performance next year. Planning to add 6 more cameras but waiting for Tapo C310 outdoor to launch.",4
"UPDATE: DON'T BUY IT FOR USING AS BABY MONITOR, COMPLETELY UNRELIABLE FOR THAT. Motion sensing notifications only work when there is a gap of 10 minutes between each motion. If the baby moves within few minutes of the previous notification, the app won't detect it, won't send a notification!

All this when the screen is continuously ON and watching the live camera feed. As I already wrote below, the TAPO APP IS USELESS for motion detection because it stops sending notifications after 5 minutes of turning off the screen.

OLD REVIEW: I bought it specifically for using as a BABY MONITOR. Camera is perfect with lots of adjustments and functions. Motion sensitivity is perfect and adjustable.

Night view (infrared) IS TOO GOOD, I can even see a tiny 1 inch toy on the bed in pitch black room!

The camera app called ""TAPO"" IS USELESS FOR MOTION DETECTION WHEN MOBILE SCREEN IS TURNED OFF. I have done 100 tweaks in the phone like disabling optimization, enable auto start, battery optimization, lock app in recents tray etc etc. But TAPO app notifications stop after 5-6 minutes of turning off the screen anyways. Obviously it's the fault of App developers because not a single other app gets killed like this like Skype, WhatsApp etc, they run perfectly in the background.

So I am forced to keep the phone's screen on continuously to receive timely motion detection notifications. Imagine the battery drain! It's around 10% battery usage per hour with screen on, whereas it will need only 2% battery per hour with screen off!

UPDATE: I have found a TRICK to decrease the battery drain while using the TAPO app. I downloaded an app from play store called BLACKR. It turns the mobile screen black (just like a locked screen) without actually turning off the screen. You can make gestures on the black screen to wake it up again. So I run the tapo app then then pull the notification shade down to run Blackr app from the shortcut. Now the tapo app keeps sending notifications for hours while the screen is black, almost like turned off. This way, the battery drain is about 4% per hour which is acceptable.

Still I would advice NOT TO BUY TP LINK CAMERA IF YOU NEED IT FOR TIMELY MOTION DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS.",4
"I was confused with this cam and Mi one and decided to try it. Really satisfied with the product. It is supporting 128gb class 10 micro SD card and I have enabled recording only during motion is detected. I never knew about this option before buying it. This helps to have data for a long time than recording it continuously. Motion sensor is really good as it detects even if there is movement by an insect.

I was really satisfied as I can see and control the camera when I am not at home and I can access the live view or recording from anywhere in the world using the Tapo app. I was not aware of this also when I had ordered it. I thought it would work only if am in the same wifi and I can access the live view or recording only from same wifi like dash cams. It alerts you when there is a motion detected and you can see the live view or recordings from wherever you are at that point of time (if mobile network is there :)",5
"EDIT after 7 months of 24x7 usage
=============================
The camera still works great. It has been deployed in my (covered) porch outside in Rajasthan from the day I bought it, so it faces dust and weather abuse (temperature 1-2deg in winters, ~50deg in summers). I thought of testing its outdoor capabilities, although it is stated that this is an indoor cam. It is behaving pretty well till now, nothing out of place or different than when this guy was new. Upcoming scortching summers will test it inside out, and if it stays stable throughout, I am getting 3-4 more for coverage! I somehow didn't get this level of reliability and features in any outside-rated cam available.

Just received and my God! What a little beast it is. Loads of features in this negligible amount Motion detection (3-level sensitivity adjustment), custome pan/tilt positions, camera sharing, night vision, alarm system, near 360 pan, great fov, decent 1080p, recording on phone (haven't tested sd-card thing, but it is said that it supports that too). Configuring was a breeze. It also has both speaker and microphone, so you can speak something 'into' the camera from wherever you are, and obviously can hear from the camera too. Both these things work decently, I've tested their stability well.

Most important thing, its completely hassle free, install and forget thing. Once configured, if the power goes off, it'll be ready for use, auto-connected to wifi once power is back (I know its an obvious requirement, but still I loved that). You can use the app to see the live feed & record on your phone itself (in addition to sd card in the cam) anywhere in the world, and pan/tilt remotely. I've played with almost every feature and let me tell you, its a serious deal. Build quality could use some more thoughts, but this is supposed to be used inside. Looks are great. Also the alarm sound levels are just average, but again its just an added feature and decent enough to place the creeping elements in a puddle of confusion. For alarm, it can also blink a pretty bright white LED near the camera lens, along with sound.

Only thing that remains to be seen is its 24x7 performance and durability. I've put it on duty, and will update this review after a month or so.",5
"Below are some point that you should consider before you but

1) Camera has huge issue with SD Cards, it simply don't work with SD card more than 32GB. because it only support FAT32 file system. If you inset 64GB or more SDcard it will corrupt it.

2)No NAS support (Network attached storage), if you want to view recording in PC, you have to remove SD card from camera and insert into Laptop. and when you insert again in Cam it get malfunction.

3) It doesn't support low light color mode.

4) Once you attached the wall mount support into cam, it become impossible to remove it. make sure you fix the mount to Wall first and then attached the cam.

5) App layout is good and responsive.

6) It has RTSP protocol, which is good to watch live feed in PC via VLC or other media.
these are the big difference when compared to other IP cam in market

7) Camera microphone is sensitive, can capture low voice as well. But Camera Speaker is not good, Output sound is very low.",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Worst product i have got so far.I thought the product would be good as it is from a good brand.But after I received the product it doesn't work after turning the power on.It just showing a red blinking light on the right side of the camera lens after that nothing happens.Returning the product",1
"Writing it after 2 months of usage
1. Easy to setup and install
2. Classic look and smooth 360 rotation
3. Easy to operate andriod app
4. Can be integrated with fire TV stick and Alexa
5. Microphones are not very great but okish
6. There isn't any desktop app available. This is one of the biggest drawback I found. If you don't have smartphone then this camera is useless
7. Able to record offline in sd card (can be replayed using android app). I am using 32 GB SD card and able to save last 2-3days of recordings.
8. We can record the camera view via mobile app.
9. We can capture the screenshots from mobile app.",4
"TP-Link Tapo is a great product. We bought this for monitoring our puppies movements at night and now we use it for monitoring his movements when we step out.

Pros:
- 360 degree horizontal view
- 2 way talk
- Alert alarm
- Configurable video recording time window
- Configurable zone for pre setting camera position
- Privacy mode
- Motion notification to mobile app are prompt (within seconds)
- Motion detection zone helps to notify only for motion within a capture zone
- Speaker volume is good

Could be better:
- Motion detection is not configurable as to notify only when to notify. This makes notifications too frequent if you are using it as a baby or pet monitor
- Audio quality gives static sometime. Could have been better
- Although speaker volume is good. It’s audio quality gives static and one has to be clear which speaking into it

Hope this helps",5
"Better performance compared to other cameras. Does not go off line, alerts are quite reliable. Recording can be shared and stored for offline viewing.
Picture quality in night vision is really poor and cloud storage not available",4
"After the physical installation, I was able to access it via Mobile App in 15 mins. Easy Wifi and mobile app configuration.
Video quality is great when both Camera and Mobile are connected to same WiFi. When accessing via Internet (different physical location), it's better to use LOW video quality setting.
The only Con is that it's neither Cloud enabled nor allows access via Computer (PC or Mac). So, the only way to save the recording is on SD card which is useless in case of out of home installation.",4
"Pros:
-Motion detection is very accurate and it starts recording a few moments before the actual motion starts.
-Keeps recording on SD card even when wifi/internet is not available. You can easily access the recordings later.
-Allows sharing camera with two people. Admin has all the controls and the people you share the camera with can access the recording and view live footage. They cannot access camera controls which is a plus.
-Night vision is good. Make sure you don't place the camera behind a window glass.
-Good quality videos which makes it easier to recognize faces.
-Tapo app is intuitive and easy to use.
- Live stream can be viewed via VLC player on a laptop/PC via RTSP. Just open network stream on VLC and type your details in the following format: ""rtsp://username:password@IP Address:554/stream1""
Make sure you have created ""Camera Account"" in Advanced Settings of Tapo app first. The credentials you set there should be used for RTSP.

Cons:
-Haven't found them yet.",5
"Does not work - bad chinese product - dont ever buy. It has problem in capturing image and stuck in videos and asks reset the wifi and password. Damn chinese good. Dont buy, wastage of money.",1
"The product looks professional. It asks for login to there server and shares a location with them during the initial setup. After that, it can be used without the internet with minimum features. Till then it's ok. But remember it is not a device that you can directly connect to your phone or computer through device Hot-spot. You need to have a dedicated WiFi switch preinstalled at your place. As compared to the price, the video quality and night vision quality is very poor. Moreover, the motion sensor is not very smart. It alarms at any minor change like the movement of a leaf due to wind. I was planning to 10 pieces of the same and this purchase was for quality testing. I am very disapponited and I am not going to buy the same to fulfill my requirement of 11 pieces.",1
"Feature wise it seems good but not reliable at all, it died after 3 weeks of usage. And service they hardly provide been a month since being spoilt still trying to get the company to repair or replace under warranty. Poor product and poor service.",1
"excellent way better than expected, easy in installation , MICROSD SUPPORTED , on ur choice can set all notification, i am using Day vision at night as there's 3 light on street so result is good. can save setting to motion detection only which can save more space and can save video in LOW and High quality which is good option voice recording als at good level and when we speak from mobile side camera speaker sound is OK not bad",4
"using this Tapo C200 for last one week. The installation was easy and straightforward. Had no issues installing 64 gb class 10 SanDisk sd card. Recoding on the card works fine, even without out internet. As of today the firmware does not support cloud storage. Only sd card storage and recording on mobile device via app. But it is mentioned that they are working on cloud storage on their site in later firmware. 64 Gb card is Ok for last 8...9 days backup in HD. Pan and tilt functions work great. The camera remembers it's last position in case of power shutdown. Night vision is fine, will not say it is great, but it is just fine. Overall the Tapo app is good with clean interface and easy to use. Have ordered one more Tapo camera C100, this is without Pan and tilt, rest functions seems same as C200. As i need the one to mount on side wall in fixed position. C100 will be fine for the same.",5
"Looking for an INDOOR CAMERA? Go for it. Best in the Indoor range. I am saving you the sweat and anger and sleepdays of scrawling You tube videos, posting questions in Quora, checking numerous blogs and what not.

1) Day and night vision both are amazing 2)
Talk back feature both ways is good ( tested with Mom) 3) Motion Detection and Camera detection both need to be switched on if want to get notifications for motion. It detects motion well( gives silent notifications to the owner of the app ) and 4) the Alarm from the camera buzzes to scare the intruder- 4.1 ) the Alarm sound is medium 4.2) Both Sound and / or light can be set to ring/ flash during motion detection 4.3) Two alarm sound options 5) For indoors and if planning to use outdoors keep it under a roof because it's NOT WATER PROOF. 6) Download Tapo App and configure with DONGLE OR MODEM whichever you use. I am using it with JIOFI DONGLE ON available Jio plans which we use for Jio Sims. 7) Using the registered email ID for the Tapo App 4 people can log in the App and check the activity on the device at the same time from any location/ city/ state IF the camera is connected to the INTERNET. 8) Within the home you can be in the same network as the camera or not ( upto you) and if outside the home you can move the camera and see and do the usual settings using your mobile internet too ( again if the camera is connected to the internet at home). 9) Tapo App has many modification settings which Idk others provide or not. 10) Face detection for family members is not there ( or maybe I am not aware) bit what more do you need in this amount? I have not yet screwed it at one place ..I keep moving it from place to place since it's 5 th day of the use. My mom loves it already. No hassle of spreading wiring for indoor Security.",4
"Good camera, best motion detection feature,

Cons:
Software improvement required.
Server is bit slow, when connecting to camera from remote place over internet it takes time.
Android software not works properly on android TV, works in portrait , only in video full screen mode it works on landscape mode.
NAS drive recording feature not present, need memory card for recording.
Made in Chaina!",5
"This review comes after using the Tapo C100 camera for a couple of weeks

I use it to monitor a few stray cats that I take care of in my apartment. So the camera is fitted in the basement car park. I have designed a long range WiFi system and I use MotionEyeOS on a raspberry pi as a DVR.

The good points:

1. Night vision is very good. Very clear images.
2. Motion detection is good. You get a notification on the Tapo app when the camera senses movement. If you point this camera on an area which has a lot of movement, you can define zones that you want to monitor for movement.
3. Camera offers RTSP and ONIF streams. I use the RTSP stream to connect to my MotioneyeOS on the Raspberry Pi and it works quite well. That is how I am able to get still images.
4. The Tapo app is easy to use once you get a hang of it. Playback from memory card is smooth. and the live view is smooth as well (it better be!).
5. Speaker and audio is very good for the price point.
6. Easy to mount and swivel on the base.
7. Angle of view is wide.

The not-so-good points:

1. Camera only connects to 2.4Ghz WiFi and that to only to channels 1, 6 and 11. Depending on where you live, your WiFi might be weak in these channels.
2. Camera seems to go offline if there is no internet connection when it is booting up. This is a problem when there is a power cut and the Internet is not yet available before the camera boots up.
3. The alarm cannot be trigged on demand. It will automatically trigger when there is movement, if you have configured it to do so.
4. Images appear over sharpened. See example photos I have posted.
5. No cloud storage. So the cam needs to be connected to the internet for you to see the images on the card. However, this problem can be mitigated by using a DVR (MotioneyeOS in my case).

My conclusion is that for its price, the Tapo C100 is an excellent WiFi IP Camera. Just for comparison, a Raspberry Pi zero costs 1500 and a decent Raspberry pi camera with a wide angle lens and night vision costs twice as much. I have gone that route only to realise that buying a readymade WiFi IP camera is cheaper.",4
"It's supports Onvif & RTSP for local recording or third party NVR software like blue iris, shnobi, etc. It also support Alexa/Google integration to view on echo show and Google display.
Good video quality, easy setup, decent night vision. Good camera for the price. No cloud subscription needed. You may also record on sd card.
4 star for picture quality.",4
"It's completely useless product when we talk about ease of installation..I bought it and configured in my phone when I was in India..Now I am thousands of miles away from my family and it's removed itself when my son pressed the RESET button by mistake..Now I lost the control over camera and watch it just as a dome camera without any other functions...and it's showing "" YOU DONT HAVE PERMISSION TO USE THIS OPTION"" It's completely waste of money...Don't understand why the designers design such a nasty products and write those algorithms in such a way that which is of no use to anyone...It's totally nonsense....",1
"Product is true to its description and other reviews. The starting experience is hassle-free, mobile app and settings are simple. And the power cable is really long. :)

It does not have NAS support, but that was something which I knew while purchasing.

Would add few points which may not be present in description and reviews:

1) Motion detection is sensitive but cannot distinguish between human, animal and other moving objects. Even at the lowest sensitivity, it considers insects' movements and keeps recording.
Avoid installing it near a light source.

2) You can save some spots/positions in the 360 deg x 110 deg space as favourites and can jump to those angles quickly. But no matter where is your current camera position, if power goes or camera restarts, camera will move to its default position. There is no setting/workaround to overcome this as confirmed by their support team.

So, place the camera in a way, that the default position is towards the most preferred angle that you want to view/record.

3) You can use a third party app to access the video feed but you will not be able to Pan or Tilt even if it claims it supports ONVIF. This is confirmed in their forum.

And just in case anyone is curious, you cannot rotate around continuously. It reaches 355 deg and stops, you have to rotate in opposite direction to reach 0. Be rest assured this will cover more than 360 deg in camera footage/ coverage, with a decent overlap.

Overall, a very good purchase for the price point if you dont care about above points.

Hope these help someone.",4
"Best camera for the price. Pros which I observed.
1. Recording on Motion detection only, this helps in saving space kn the microSD card and its life as well
2. Auto switching of day and night mode based on light conditions rather than time.
3. Clarity of the image
4. Speed of the app. Have connected it through a 4G connection and speed is pretty good when accessed from internet.
5. Build quality is good
6. Firmware updates.
7. Pretty easy to setup.

Cons.
Only one, not sure why but it detects the memory card and suggests if its original or not. Detected Tiitan 128GB card as not original though it's working fine.

Finally you need a wifi router to use this cam.",5
"I feel below things are good

1. Design
2. Camera quality
3. Easy to install
4. App
5. Can talk in speaker
6. Alarm

Note: Poor customer support, When I send mail to customer care, they replying very late more than 10days

I don't like because
1. Software has some bug
2. They can provide more feature in app
3. Delete option not there to clear any specific date video
4. Loop video recording not working for me
5. Format memory card is not working through app.

I am using samsung 124GB class 10",3
"I bought this product. Though the Camera clarity was good. But this product had issues in Horizontal movement. I send it to Service center to get this fixed. But post service support, I see a vertical movement issue.

So, technical(wait for call center person for an hour to get a response) and service support are not that great. Please keep this in mind before purchasing. If you are product is good out of box then fine, if not we will have a tough time to get this fixed through technical and service support.",1
"Delivered early.
Set-up easily.
clarity is good for the price and 2MP.
ONLY the problem is that it got connected at the first setup without any problem.
But after the power went off and came back, it does not connect to the wifi automatically, moreover, tried to connect manually and it never worked. it says to reset, did it more than 10 times. The phone connected to the Camera but the camera cannot connect to WiFi at all. It keeps saying ""Connecting to WiFi"" forever.
Could be a faulty device. Requested for replacement.
This is happening even after replacement also. Returning it.",2
"Thou i havent used tech support. This is a very prompt and very good camera. It rotates 360 it tilts up and down. I can watch my dog activities and any theft act while being away from home. I have a very bad neighbour thats why have to install it. Now they are in control lol.
Night vision is fine but it focus on the glass in front of the door. So ive to keep my corridor light on in the night to record.
Cameras motion detect is smooth and detect everything sends notification right away and you can just tap on it and view who it was outside the door.such a good feature.
Also keep a good memory card like i had 32 gb it goes straight to record for 4 days then i have to format via mobile or you can copy it on your laptop, then reinsert the card. I prefer using mobile to format the card.",5
"It is a tiny wonder. Works pretty well. Can check real time and recordings anywhere through mobile app, it is just great. There was an issue with linking it through the router (dual band) but having an extension with a single band router, it did not have those issues. Attaching further cameras, once uploaded is very easy if you make the app remember the settings. The long power cable is a boon, you won't have to fix additional extensions. Picture quality is great, mounting is easy and what not. Excellent asset to your home security and peace of mind.",5
"Best one for record ,remote view. Best one . You can talk.make a call and say something .you almost connect with it internet for remote view purpose nor you can just connect it with router for local view without use of internet access.Recording schedule features and motion detection recording features choose as per your need.continue recording features support up to 128gb memory card for local save and view later in phone or in laptop. or access instant through tplink tapo app .and many more features.",5
"Camera stopped working in 1 day, after reset also not working.

Will share few observations, might be helpful

Advantages

Lengthy power cable to connect to power source
Motion Detection and alerts
Good Quality picture comparitively

Disadvantages

More prompt Technical & warranty Support required
Reliability and stable functioning issues
Problem in connecting to wifi after power failure
Frequent resetting of camera is required incase of any problem.
Inconvenience in reaching camera physically when installed at heights or unreachable places to reset/remove sd card.
No software/ option to record to pc/laptop.
Manually record or save video from timeline to phone and then transfer recorded video from phone to other storage.
In continuous recording, there are no motion markers to directly move to motion events, we have to watch timeline.

If these are resolved and improved it would be wonderful product",1
"Simply perfect monitoring camera at affordable price for indoor/outdoor. Not a perfect security system but serves the purpose. Pros and cons below. (Personal user opinions)

Pros:
1. Great motion detection with faster notification compared to others in the segment
2. Night vision is just great. Clear vision in extreme dark conditions.
3. Tapos app is good, customisable options like motion sensitivity, area of sensitivity etc.
4. Calling from anywhere in the world (average quality of sound) serves the purpose.
5. Alarm function..
6. Hassle free use, auto network reconnection.

Cons:
1. No motion tracking. If the 360 cam can track and move would have been excellent. (hopefully expected in future software updates)
2. Suppose if someone wearing a mask can damage the camera/steal, won't be able to find out because it is directly recorded in to the memory card inside camera itself and we can only view if connected to the camera. But if we detect the motion we can record manually to the phone directly.",5
"Noise was less in both Night and Day modes. Picture quality waa better than C200. Clicks pics when motion is detected. App works too. 2-pin DC adapter is provided as well.

Download the app and switch on the camera and app will connect to camera hotspot. Then app will ask you to provide details to connect to your home wifi network. Camera's hotspot will be disabled and then it will connect to your wifi and then you will be able to access the cam feed from app and receive motion alerts.",5
"Reviewing after using for around 2 months.
The Product is easy to install and use.  Configuration is easy. Stays connected on WiFI reliably. Software has enough features for a regular user.

Installation HW is included for standard wall/roof mount. If one needs a special installation away from the wall, one can also install on a bracket (which you have to arrange).

The angle adjustment. pan/tilt works in a very reliable way. One can also set some default markers (preset positions) to where camera angle can be moved with click of a button (e.g. road side view, door view, balcony view, parking view - you can set and give name of your choice).

Motion detection - One can also define zones within which one wants motion to be detected.
One can also define a schedule for motion detection and recording (which hours one wants continous  recording and which hours only when motion is detected.

Through the Tapo App, one can get alerts and also access recordings from anywhere in the world. Recordings are on the SD card which is on the camera. I wish they add an easy to use utility to support network storage. There are methods available but too technical for a common non computer literate or a geek user.

Sound - quality of microphone and speaker an average (usually camera is installed at a height and away from person talking or listening so there is not much to expect from this aspect.

Overall with a price around Rs 2500 for the camera and few hundred rupees for the memory. It is a value for money product. In the app, on one network one can add up to 32 Tapo Cameras if one wants a more elaborate setup. ",5
"I am really happy to buy this product over D3D. My friend has one D3D but I did not like the motion detection and quality of image of it. So I was confused to buy that. And after much googling I found this. And I am happy that I choose this. Till now I did not find any cons of it, as I am using it for a week now.",5
"The TP Link Tapo C200 came well packed, sealed and undamaged. Comes with its own power adapter with a very long cable length. Build quality is good. One has to install the Tapo TP link app on mobile to setup and view camera on mobile. Same wifi network is to be used.

There is no provision for watching cam footage from remote location through cloud. I have not yet inserted the micro SD card. I am yet to try the rtsp streaming on VLC player.

It is over a week now since i used it. I inserted a 32 MB SD card. The unit works perfectly . A small correction about remote viewing.
Once you have the Tapo TP lnk app on mobile you can watch live feed and stored footage on SD card from any corner of the world with a data connection, as long as you have a wifi with internet at home. Pic is pretty clear too. Planning to buy more. I already have a regular CP plus 4 channel DVR, but i feel this is way better for indoor use.

19-09-2020: It has been working flawlessly so far. The video quality is amazing and file size is not that big too. It works with Alexa only if you have 'Echo show' unit, which i don't so I can't comment on that aspect.",4
"The camera is like a robot when it initialises. Its can twist and turn and resolution is good. You can even live stream to a computer using rtsp streams and use as webcam. It has 2 way communication so can be used as a door phone.

How ever there is a delay of about 5 seconds in live stream which is a serious issue as you cant see or communicate to other side in real time. Sometime its delay is upto 10 seconds.
Another issue is that sometimes it disappears off the network for few seconds. after a few refreshes its back on line. not sure its a network issue or camera issue",4
"It is good camera but tech support needs to be improved, pls help me with me nas storage on same network",4
"Absolutely sham reviews by non-Indian countries. Does not deserve even one star. The device does not connect with WiFi even when the camera and router is in the same room. More so, Amazon will wash hand as soon as it reaches your door - and then YOU suffer.
Received a replacement. Still unusable. Unstable product unsuitable for use. The product is itself a security hazard. Zero reliability. You cannot ever rely on something for security which is in beta state. Lost confidence on this product and on tp link too! Amazon must discontinue selling this product to customers. Very shocked",1
this camera stops working after few days of service. initially switching off and on will do the solution later it will not work if you restart the camera. Auto reboot function also does not give any solution. you don't buy this product and it is waste of money. suppose you stay in a remote location and want to watch your surrounding at that time it will show you offline in the app even though all other parameters are fine at both end. why do you want to buy a product which takes away peace of mind ?,1
"Pros:
- Easy of setup and configuration.
- Good Quality steaming
- 360 degree coverage
- Good backup upto 22 days with 128 BG card
- Good Audio (speakers) and good Mic clarity.
- Good adapter cable length.
- Good Night vision
- Honestly, motion detection works really well, but can get annoying quickly, so I’ve turned the feature off.

Cons:
Works only with electricity
Works only if there’s internet",5
"Kept outdoor inverted this doesn't come as water proof but my portico ceiling covers the camera protected from water , works perfectly fine, features such as motion detection, playback view , alarm are good. Wifi is mandate, since the recording is happening in SD card inserted within the camers and if intruder damages or takes away the camera then nothing can be done. So you need to install at a place where intruder cannot reach that easy. We can zoom but not to the level where you can recognise number plate or even face. Closer the object more the better the view. Since I have installed outdoor audio quality isn't that great, it captures all the noice but with less clarity. If the manufacturer increases video quality (MP) and fine tune audio for only voices , then this prodcut is the best in market compared to others.",5
"So I have been searching for a low budget but equally dependable security camera for a while now for my store.

I already have a euro vigil security camera but it’s a basic one. I was quoted ₹5900 for a new camera having all the features that this camera has.

Though I was skeptical about this option at this price. I went on buying it just to explore my options.

The camera arrived and has been using it for two days now.

Pros
1. Connectivity is brilliant. You can watch live steam without any glitch on the tapo app
2. 360 rotation is very handy
3. Voice feature where you can talk through the app and speak through the camera
4. 24/7 recording though you need to buy an SD card
5. Easily mountable if you have basic pieces of equipment

Cons
1. Seems a bit bulky
2. Very fragile
3. The plastic quality could have been better

Overall seems a good buy considering the options available. I would go ahead and buy 2 more after reviewing it for another 7 days.

The app interface is also user friendly you can configure it on your own following instructions or browse through a YT tutorial to get a walkthrough.

Recommended buying.

If you like the review do mark it as helpful.",4
"Best product.. Premium look. Gud clarity for videos. Voice call is not clear.
Memmory card slot is in safest area.. Under the camera lens.. So other people cant remov.. A missing feature is smart tracking. Tapo app works well. Very easy to install and configure the camera.. Works with both alexa and Google home.. Home automation is a best feature for this price range camera..
About night vision, it can detect exat time to shift to night vision..i m telling this Because some cameras will shift to night if just switch off the light in day time also..

Soo.. Almost all the features are best..
But voice call option not clear.",4
"It's the best Wifi camera available at this price range. I ordered one initially and loved it. I have ordered one more now. Its a wifi camera , you can view live and stored recordings (if you have inserted memory card). I'm using sand disk 64GB memory card and it and it stores for 6 days with minimum motion detection.

When the storage is full there is option called loop, when you enable it, data gets rewritten automatically.

You need to have Power supply and Wifi access always , otherwise you cannot access the camera.

Camera clarity is top notch. Mic and Speakers are good.

You can record the video and share it in whatsapp or any app.",5
"I have attached 2 pictures that reflect the picture quality of the camera. as you can see 1 of the picture is from daylight and the second one is from night view. though night vision is not up to mark well I can understand they mentioned about night vision range they mentioned that this is a camera is for indoor security purposes...

pros and cons:

pros:
1 Camera quality: 5 out of 5
2 Motion Detection: 5 out of 5 (Camera literally captures moving leaves of the tree and instantly notifying me as ""Motion Detected"" )
3 Connectivity: 5 out of 5

cons:

Night Vision: less range",5
"The camera is well built, easy to configure and use. The app is also pretty decent. Overall not a feature heavy but a good buy.
Negatives: 1. Audio quality is not great. A lot of feedback and no noise cancellation. At times you will not understand what you are hearing.
2. No cloud storage or any way to configure any other location on the network to store the videos. You have to keep it on the SD card and has user limitations. Keeps on showing unstable network a lot of times.
3. Cloud transfer is slow and buggy sometimes.",4
"it is worst in terms of the audio capture and nothing can be understood even if nearby and loud enough. My other reolink is like a thousand times better. no return, don't go for it",1
"I did not want to purchase it initially as it is a Chinese product. However, the features it offers are matchless. I use it for monitoring maid servants taking care of the baby.
Pros:
1. Very high quality resolution. You can even see baby's teeth while laughing.
2. Two way communication. Very useful feature. It almost works like a walkie-talkie.
3. Motion slider on phone. You can control the motion via phone easily
4. Works even without SD Card. (If you just want to monitor and not record)
5. No Cloud cost, works locally
6. Total Cost = Camera Cost + SD Card cost (optional)
Cons:
1. Automatic Motion is not very good
2. Wifi dependent - No wifi, no camera. But I guess we live in an always connected world now.

Overall, I am rating it 4 star as I do not find the Cons very significant and I point goes away for being a Chinese product.",5
"Got the camera for 2 reasons- live streaming and to listen to audio. Had to put this in a remote office and wanted a live cam there.
So the good bits.. really easy to set up. The app is great, movements of the camera are precise and night vision is fabulous.
It connects easily to the wifi and the streaming quality is good too. However the audio was totally useless. Could'nt make out anything. Amazon didn't allow returns so I had to buy a new one(blurams, which had better video and audio quality) and use this in another location where audio was not required.
The SD card support is good, though. I used a 128GB card, whose recording you can access through phone as well.
All in all, pretty good except for the audio, which is useless.
Adding an update to this.
So , i found another camera with slightly better audio. But the acoustics of the room matter a lot. Eventually, I ordered two more of these. The reasons are:
Less fish eye effect in this camera.
Easy to record on sd card and obtain that recording through phone.
The panning is through arrows and is very precise, unlike other camera software where you have to drag the view.(it's a matter of preference, both are equally good).",3
"I would rate it 3 stars, because Mi camera is anyway better than this TP-Link camera, because:
1) The camera takes approx 6-7secs to load and display the live footage everytime u open the camera on the app
2) The app regularly signs-out, making you feed in the login credentials multiple times.
Both point 1 and 2 combined, makes it frustrating at times to access/use the camera when you want to access the live/recorded footage on an urgent basis.",3
Very good camera for indoor and office use. Viewing angle is very good. We can control the camera completely from the app. Mic is functioning good. We can hear every sound from the camera mic through our mobile app from anywhere. Internet is compulsory for both camera and mobile to view the video in app. Overall a very good camera in this segment.,4
"I would say, very nice performance. Easy to setup, can be easily connected to WiFi, make it online and view in Android devices. Overall it auto reconnects... Provides 24/7 surveillance. The app provides decent configurations. Built quality is great. Mounting on wall is easy. Comes with very long charging cable which is useful. Only negative I found that the device can be shared to only two more people or devices. It should have allowed more shareable connections. However, other than that, I would recommend it and does serve the purpose to the fullest.",5
"The best product among this type of product category. Motion detection is excellent. Immediate response on phone. Tapo Camera application is 5 star. PAN / TILT, Horizontal Cruise, Vertical Cruise, and Marker feature are the best features.
*****
Easy Configuration.
BEST PRODUCT. THE QUALITY OF PRODUCT IS VERY HIGH IN COMPARISON TO OTHER SUCH TYPE OF CAMERAS.",5
"Just an awesome product by tp-link
The camera is just awesome the video clarity is awesome and the night vision in it is also very crystal clear
The mic for two way audio is a really helpful thing its use is good

Pros
1) 360 degree so it can cover all the area of frontage of a home
2) two way audio is just awesome
3) motion detection is also very good it will give instant notification in your smartphone or other devices
4) connectivity is very good in the tapo app

Cons
In my usage noting only some issues with the tapo app

Anyway a fantastic product by tp-link",5
"Excellent product. Using it for the past 2 months. No problem at all. Easy to install and linking to mobile
Highly sensitive to detect even small motion, night vision is very good, clarity, video recording are good. Does not come with memory card. Buy 64 gb card and install. It gives almost 30-40 days back up on motion detection. Installation, you can do it by yourself. Don't need any expertise. Strongly recommended.",5
"Really nice product with some minor scope of improvements:
1. Has a good amount of lag. I initially though it is because of my phone's modem but later I took Airtel Fiber connection and initially the camera didn't connect. After resetting it it worked but there is a lag.
2. Lot of rotation on start of camera which can be avoided.
3. Sound quality is very poor and there is a lot of lag and disturbance and the person at the door can't understand what you are speaking due to noise.
4. Noise cancellation is not there so whatever you speak is heard back to you and thus creating an infinite loop of noise.",4
"TAPO Camera is damaging Memory Card installed with Camera. It damaged brand new functional Memory cards and made it not-functional.

I have experience of using MI and other cameras with 1GB / 8GB / 64GB memory card and saving continuous recording and were nice in all manners.

I purchased 2no. of C200 camera in Sept 2020. I installed 1 GB memory card with one camera, Camera worked with card for few days and after few days it made memory card non-functional. Frequent got message that memory card is not working. I purchased three more memory cards of 64GB in October 2020 and installed first 64GB memory card with with one camera. Camera made 64GB memory card non-function. I tried with third memory 64GB, again it became non functions. due to the series of problem i use my 64GB (3rd) brand new memroy card with another camera. it also became non-functional after 10 days.

After loosing 4 (3 new + 1Old) memory cards, now i am sure that its not fault of Memory card, but fault of TP-LINK Cameras - TAPO 200.

I am also not getting proper support from any end. I recommend NEVER TO BUY TpLink - tapo C 200 camera.",1
"Very good esp. when used with app for real time monitoring. Also can be set to send real-time ALERTS in PHONE WITH LINK, in Sensing MOVEMENT. One ISSUE is IF your INTERNET DISCONNECTS, you have to MANUALLY RESET camera & RECONNECT with App for it use normally. Else it's stays DISCONNECTED, does not automatically reconnect. Picture Wuality, Nightvision, Microphone function all are very GOOD. Recommend it!",5
"I got this camera without knowing a feature that was very important to me i.e. Works at night without IR night vision. I wanted to disable IR LED and this camera has the option that actually resolve all my problems. I used to keep it behind a window glass but because IR LEDS are activated, it glows like the mirror and nothing is seen beyond the window glass due to IR reflection. So I wanted those disabled at Night. I had a YI DOME 1080 camera with same features and smaller size but it didn't have this feature of disabling IR LEDS , so I used to switched it off at nights everyday that was cumbersome to me. But the app and camera of this Tapo resolved all my issues. The only thing missing in this camera as compared to previous one is - Automatic Tracking/Cruise tracking and the colour production of objects at infinity.
i am using 8gb memory card class 4, an old sdcard for continuous storage upto 24 hours. For more info about the app and camera, please check it's app features on apple store or playstore. almost all features are working in the camera. Clarity is awesome that even in Night, without IR LEDS activated, it captures somehow visible streaming. Street lights are working in street so it doesn't require IR and night vision. It captures around 80ft. front visible boundary of my street in length. You can imagine how wide vision it has. Because it is motorized rotary 360 degree camera, I wish the motor keep working for long. My YI dome camera got vertical motor non-functional so I had to returned that within warranty period. Fingers crossed for this tapo camera.",5
It says no internet access on setup. Tried with different router and different phone no luck. Also recording not happening,1
"It's been a month I am using this cam and seems to OK at this price.
Pros: Camera is quite OK and installation is also easy.
Cons: I have tried 7 memory cards till now starting from 1gb card to 128 GB but none was working. Only HP16gb Aviao card worked finally... Fyi... all the other cards which I have used are all in perfect working condition.",4
"It works ok like any other PTZ IP camera however when streamed on echo show and on nest hub, stream is delayed by 8 seconds, defeating the purpose , further stream wont last for more then 30-60 seconds, will disconnect and wont connect again. It mandates use of TAPO App for concurrent stream thus making it utter useless if you plan to stream on smart displays, keep in mind while buying.",1
"Good smart camera for home security. It connects instantly with your Wi-Fi. You can configure this camera on your smartphone. It can be connected with multiple smartphones using Tapo application.

Motion detection works perfectly on this camera and night version is also pretty good, you can actually check old recordings as well. It has a memory card slot I'm currently using a 64 GB card which suffice the purpose.

I haven't used their tech support yet, however, I am pretty sure that being a very old and dependable company, the tech support should be good.",5
"Recently i changed my wifi network and when i try to configure th cam with nee wifi by resetting it is unable to detect the new wifi network, the wifi is fibre based and runs 4 as well as 5g. I called up support he was very rude and when he is not able to resolve, he disconnected the call. Pathetic experience. Dont buy this product, it says one year warranty but no one cares.",1
"I am very much happy with this deal. Initially, I got a TAPO C200 had some connection issue, so I went for replacement. Surprisingly within one day, I got my new product and I am very much satisfied with this product.
It has very good wifi connectivity range.
Good quality camera capture.
Good night vision.
and best is, without WiFi also it records and stores it in the memory card.",5
"Positive:
1. Best clarity
2. More features two way speak
3. Quick connect
4. Motion detection

Negative points;
1. Motion detection may not worth
2. It will not capture motion detection in automatically
3. Notification just flash message with out sound and you will not aware if mobile screen not on or using.
4. Camera gone offline and unable to wakeup.",1
"This is not a true IP Camera. You can’t access the streaming using URL or Web application. You can’t access this camera remotely. Once again saying loud & clear “ THIS IS NOT A TRUE INTERNET PROTOCOL CAMERA “. Please check the CONS before buying.
You cannot return this item back if not satisfied. No refund available.Only option available is replacement. Don’t spend money on this useless camera.",1
"Don't buy this camera it stops working wit in 2 months , wen u give it to the service center for replacement it will take more then a month for the replacement to arrive. One of the worst customer service I have come acrossed . No one. Takes the responsibility .",1
"Great product. I got it on sale with cash back final prize of around 2000 inr.
Night vision is great.
Motion sensing is just about correct to detect a intruder in the house.
I would have liked a little bit more range on the vertical radius of operation but it’s ok for home/office basic use.

Haven’t insert a memory card yet so can’t comment on that.
And not sure how much internet data the device consumes.

The app is very user friendly and allows you to record within the app itself.
I have uploaded a pht that I took straight from the app.

All in all it’s a great device.
Moneys worth!",4
"Really loved the app design and the timely notifications that keep me hooked to what's going on at the entrance of the home. Video quality is very clear and sharp. The night vision, mic interface and the pan function are really useful and handy features. Also, this device is compatible with Alexa which is an added advantage over other smart cameras. Would recommend this camera to buy around a budget of 2k.",5
"This device has some issues with pairing and connectivity. I never faced such trouble with any of devices. First it was not able to detect my wifi despite changing wifi settings for my TPLink router. After fiddling for 1 hour AND MULTIPLE DEVICE RESETS was able to connect somehow with wifi using other network option which also took 4-5 retries. On second day my router got rebooted due to power outage and security camera failed to reconnect. App was showing device to be offline. Again after trying a lot I gave up. Now I am stuck with this useless crap.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEVICE. SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WHICH RENDER THIS DEVICE AS SECURITY DEVICE EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE. OVERALL FAULTY PRODUCT. WASTAGE OF MONEY. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!",1
"Pros:
1. Super quick setup.
2. Video Quality is superb, even in low light.
3. Motion detection is perfect.
4. Can view live feed/recording from anywhere.

Cons:
1. Cannot save the video easily on mobile or any other device.
2. No, browser access.
3. Battery backup would have been a plus.",4
"Pros: Looks nice and compact, easy to install. Long power cord of the adapter is very useful. Picture clarity is good. Speaker volume is very good for the size.
Cons: The tapo app takes ages to open on my OnePlus 7. Once the app loads, it takes another minute or so to connect with the camera and open the feed. Streaming videos works well only with wifi, almost impossible on 4g mobile data. (tried with Vodafone, jio and BSNL ) This beats the whole purpose of the cam for me because I can't check on my kids while I am at work. Altogether disappointed.",3
"Really good. Good two way audio, video quality, motion detection, and alarm. Super useful. Helps me keep an eye on my house whether I’m out of town or even country as it’s WiFi connected. It records when it detects motion. But the SD cards as per your requirement, depending on how many days you wanna keep recordings for.",5
"Everything is perfect. First fresh setup is smooth where it recognises your WiFi in the *Listed available WiFi networks* smooth sailing from there.

->But when your WiFi disconnects or has no internet connection for a brief period, it can't automatically setup or connect with wifi afterwards.

-> You need to manually reset the camera and do a fresh reboot or fresh setup., Thing is this time the device can't recognise your WiFi network. It does not show your WiFi listed in the available networks.

-> Easy fix, login into your Router interface, change the wireless network frequency channel to 1 or 6 or 11. Reboot the camera device. Do a fresh setup, this time it definitely recognises your WiFi network. Also remove and insert the memory card again while setting up.",3
"Wonderful product. Easy to setup and get it to work. Shared device is a great feature to allow less tech savvy people to view the camera feed.

Taco app is amazing. You can add a total of 32 cameras into the app.

Customised camera view zone for detection, is a good feature.

Excellent microphone.",5
"Its a really good camera, had a tough decision choosing between this and the Mi Cam but i realise i made the righr choice. With accurate motion detection and good enough picture quality this is a great camera for daily usage. I have paired it with the alexa echo show 5 also and it works flawlessly. It just takes a minute to load on alexa but otherwise there is zero to no picture lag even over data, 10-20 km from the place the camera is mounted. I have been really impressed with accurate motion detection and getting alerts always on time however far away i am. But there are still some flaws when it comes to alarm as at night the alarm isnt very audible so its quite useless to alarm people inside the house but i do think it will do the job to scare anyone away atleast. But also the alarm rings sometimes when there are bees and flies close to the camera, but this is rare. The camera also has motion detection zones that i have uses and that also works flawlessly without any issues and gives accurate data. In all, i would recommand this over the MI cam as the mi cam reviews arent that great and alot of people complain about motion detection. As such i have no complaints for this camera yet. I've used it for about 3-4 months now.",4
Amazing product ... bought a home security camera first time ever and it’s absolutely worth it !! It’s so easy to install and start literally just took less than 10 minutes and it was up and running !! Haven’t used the night vision so cnt comment on the feature but so far an awesome product.,5
"I have 2 of this, both works pretty well and does its job well. The Tapo app is very good on both IOS and Amdroid.

The video streaming quality and speed is depends on the wifi coverage near the camera.

Motion detection works well and the 8GB memory card gives around 1 week of backup as the recording is set to 60% of the time",5
"In fact to have some basic surveillance this camera will be suitable. The coverage of area is decent but clarity of human faces or vehicle number plates cannot be viewed using it.
Alarm function is good. Night vision mode is also quite good.
We must have a strong wifi connection for the cam to operate at its optimal level.
To speak about the application the download of videos from or through the app is not possible still this application serves its purpose for what it is meant for.
Above all at this price it's a decent cam which can be relied upon",4
"I purchased this item to be used as a webcam for my online teaching. Yes, with the right software this camera can be streamed as a webcam feed.
Only downside (that I didn't know before purchase) is that there's no default monitoring app for PC available.
All setup and communication has to be through TAPO mobile app.",4
I would have loved it to have a USB C power cable instead of the proprietary cable. Otherwise I like how seamlessly it connects to NAS. Its been just a week but si far no issues. I also have Mi 360 cameras but I would definitely recommend this over that because my Mi cameras half the time say that my card is corrupted and can't play the videos. So it defeats the whole purpose if using as a CCTV.,5
"It’s not working after 3 months waste of money
Can any one suggest me were we can get it repaired or warranty",3
Camera needs reset after every power cut. Tech support is useless they always ask to wait for call back which never happens,1
"I got this camera to use as a door security camera and link wit my Amazon Echo Show 8, however I am not successful in linking the camera to view on Echo Show. Camera quality is often grainy.

UPDATE 03/04/2021
Recently re-tried to setup the link and now I have now successfully linked the camera with echo show and check the camera video too.",1
"Writing this review after 1 week of usage. Product is good with all the features mentioned. Picture clarity is excellent, 360 degree view works fine. Ideal for monitoring your house / kids when you are not at home. Another good feature is that you can listen to camera audio and talk back, helps when you are outside, leaving your kids at home with caretaker. Installation is quite easy and do not require technical expertise. There are lot other features like motion detection alarm, motion sensor video recording. Overall it is a good buy.",5
"Pros
Essay Setup less the 2 min
good picture quality both day and night
very long Power cable 5 meter
fast reboot and schedule reboot
alarm system when detect motion in in aria
custom motion area
good mounting stand its rotate 360 also mounting kit in the box

cons
Alarm system not work in night vision mode
its take 1 sec to switch normal mode to night mode
night infrared is visible so any one know where is camera is
leggy video play back
slow server upload speed
now particular section for motion diction notification
no HDR and full colour with low light",3
The product is very good and easy to setup. The software and interface is very easy and user friendly. The only problem is it work on 9V DC so cant use it anywhere with a 5v powebank. But there is DC-DC boost module to boost 5v to 9v. I made a converter with the module and now can be use with powerbank anywhere without depending on electricity power supply.,5
Nice camera. Picture quality ok not the best but acceptable. Have been using it since last 2 months. Only con is it does not have software to control and see recording on pc or laptop Although it does support rtsp protocol so we can see live feed but no recording or cannot manage camera using computer to manage camera and to see recordings one need to use mobile or tablet running android or ios. Otherwise it's good and can is worth the money.,4
"Tapo app failed to list my home WiFi during the installation process. Repeated the same process with a replacement cam. The same issue persists. Ironically, my home wifi is also running on a TP-Link Archer C50 router. As instructed in the manual, only 2.4Ghz band was enabled in the router. Still no luck. Contacted TP-Link customer support too, who could help me much. Finally, I had no choice to return the device. Sad!",1
"Overall product quality and the build is excellent.
Though HD recording will only records details for 10 days in a 64 GB card in continuous recording mode.
Though I am not able to find the Cloud storage option in settings.
Vedio quality in HD is great, zooming also gives a clear picture.
Motion detection works great.",5
"One of the most important purpose for which I have purchased this is 2 way audio. This is not happening. I do not know if this works for other. Remaining features are good - like easy to install, Motion detection and Night Vision.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a revised review :
I am missing
1) Saving to cloud feature, In case of theft of the camera itself, this could provide clue - who, how and when stole it.
2) Noise cancellation is bad. So lot of surrounding sound is picked up during two-way call.
3) Following a moving object feature is not there.",3
"The product is good, but as it says 360^ but it's manual it doesn't rotate automatically assume per motion. So guys if your requirement is as per motion it should rotate than don't buy this product. Rotation is manual which is of no use. There's huge noise which is while watching recording which reduces the communication had between two people. Rest is OK.",3
"There was no power cut, no loss of internet. But the 2 days old camera went offline. I need to switch OFF and ON to get connected again from mobile app. The purpose of buying the camera gets defeated, if this thing occurs every other day. I bought this camera to monitor the movements when I am miles away from home and if it goes offline then how to restart it . I am very disappointed due to this.
The camera speaker is also low in volume. One salesman was standing at my door, I turned the microphone ON from the app and was trying to speak to him, but he was not able to hear my voice. I was bit disappointed. I thought that this camera's speakers are better than other brands, but its very poor speakers.",3
"THIS WEBCAM IS A PAIN TO SET UP, IT DOES NOT DETECT MY D LINK WIFI ROUTER WHICH HAS 2.4 AND 5 GHZ CONNECTION, IT ALSO DOES NOT DETECT MY TP-LINK WIFI EXTENDER. IT DETECTS MY NEIGHBOURS WIFI, I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING. IT DOES NOT WORK, EVEN ENTER THE WIFI CONNECTION NAME MANUALLY! HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED!",1
"First of all thanks to Amazon for the deal and fast delivery.
TP-link Tapo smart camera and it's functionality is good for home security purposes & when I figured out how to create NAS storage it made my purchase a satisfactory deal. Echo is a minor cons. Over all a good product.",4
"It works as advertised but there are 3 downsides
1. About 60% of the time while using the app it shows the cam is offline but it won't affect recording feature
2. It won't record on cloud if you need to record on cloud you need to keep the app running
3. Night vision has limited range",4
"Everything is good...
Except Made in china
No auto rotary options
No Humonide detection, follow,capture images and record videos...
U can't download detection from camera, only u can view...
U need lot & lots to improve....
Srihome SH025 is far better than this one & also price is less comparatively then To C200",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 i tried to connect 12 times still fails",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Decent pricing and quality is as per the pricing.

Tapo app works well.

Alarm sound adjustment option to be enabled via app as the volume is too low

Night vision is on par with the pricing as it is not too clear as the sensor is just 2 MP.",4
"I am using these for the last 5 months. Since last month the camera has stopped working, I can not figure out why. I have a 200 Mbps connection at home, still, I can not connect to them. The only red light shows in them. I will never recommend such a camera. It's pathetic. Please don't buy it won't work for more than 4 or 5 months.",1
"Buy this camera to monitor a certain space. It has good nightvision, and nice pan and tilt. Sound capture is also good to a limited range. In the fiven sub 2k price point, this camera has no equal. Some form of environmental protection would have been even better.",5
"Issue no 1
Pretty crap motion detection. Each time a vehicle passes through, the shadows cast by raising alarm.
Issue no 2
The app forgets the logins, whenever your device losts signal and it asks for login with new uid pw by resetting the old passwords. Something very bizarre and Stupid.",2
"I’m using it from last few days. Product is very good except for 2 following problems: (1) It’s speaker volume is drastically low. As in when you speak from app, the speaker form camera doesn’t throw out high volume. (2) You cannot play recorded videos from memory card on your laptop at all! You can only watch those videos on the app.",3
I am writing this review after 2 months of purchase. My camera fell from 9 ft height and its intact and functioning. This is the only reason I thought of leaving my reviews here. Product night distant vision of 20 ft is not that great and 10 ft is good.,5
"Pros :
Mobile APP UI is good.
Easy to Install.
Cos :
Quality Image / Recording is not the best in the Day( Light reflection ) and in the Night
Lack Of Micro USB power cable
Cannot access / download footage from Laptop / Desktop.
Mobile APP sucks when you try to access Live camera Footage & recording while in the LAN .",3
"I used the camera for 2 months , the performance was above average. The cam froze few times had to reboot . The clarity is good at this price and easy to install. Make sure WiFi is stable and I tried to access with 4g ... it worked but you get better clarity with WiFi .",4
This product is good but no option to view on PC and no option for saving at cloud. No tech support,3
"Bought the tp link for home use - the devise connected to the wifi but the camera didn't. We tried for tech support. 15 days - no response - they send us from one number to another. They neither solve the problem nor do they take back the product - worst experience ever. I needed two cameras so I bought the TP Link and another camera of Sricam make - that is working beautifully so its not that our wifi is not working or that we don't know how to set up. I would have liked to give 0 rating for this product. Amazon also is not able to help us so as an online shopping site they have failed. totally bad experience.

 finally i am saying that don't purchase  this product .  ",1
"Camera is good with long power cable. And best thing about camera is real- time motion sensor. Any movement in schedule time will let you know on app in real time.

I had initial connection problem and I call customer service and it was useless. Don't expect customer service.",4
"Despite it is mentioned 1080 clarity it is not upto the mark when compared with Mi's 1080, 360 degree cam. I have tested both the cams on its mobile Apps and also SD card recordings on my PC. Result of Mi Cam is wonderful and truly with 1080 clarity with original colour while Tapo's clarity is not even 720 degree with vivid colour (darkend the colours).

I would suggest people to invest few more money and buy Mi's 1080, 360 deg cam than this because there is no return option on Amazon for this product. By the way i got this at ₹1599/-",5
"Guys, it was my 1ever security camera purchased for home use and trust be it's worth paying 2.5k for this.
You can view live video footage over wifi network/ mobile network also can connect to any normal tab and see live streaming over vlc player.
This is perfect for indoor security",5
this is my first security cam. purchase. the product is beyond expectations! most easy to install and configure. Did it all by myself just by reading the provided micro manual leaflet. very happy with the purchase!! all features ar working great. The night vision is awesome.even in pitch black room can see up to 20ft very clearly as that's the max length of my installed area. you can blindly get this one!,5
"Nice product, easy to use. I deducted a star since it doesn’t support 5GHz bandwidth. Other than that all other functions are great.
I am using it for my main door, I reside in a gated society so the risk of theft is minimised.
Product is great within this price range.",5
"If you are trying to run automation or scheduled recording, time lapse thn do not buy it because Its app is extremely outdated on App Store atleast and ur says in the app itself that they r working on it.

Motion detection and camera quality is good.",3
"Useless camera, don’t buy , stopped working after 10 days, have raised complain via phone and email with TP link but nothing, Amazon says return period lasted after 11 days , as per Amazon Tplink will replace whereas the maker is least bothered .. so don’t waste your money on there products.. Absolutely no after sales service/ help even though warranty period is for 1 year...",1
"I brought this camera to integrate with my home assistant automation, once integrated Hassio records the videos externally on HDD using rtsp protocol. Tapo need to improve the wireless range and launch outdoor unit soon in india. So far works wells",4
"Nice wifi security cam.. Clear vision in night. I am using this cam for last more than 1 month till now no issue faced..i tried many time, I disconnected the power supply and after resume power supply automatically it connect to with last connected wifi. Can operate the camera through apps
Go for it",4
"I have ordered and started using with a 64GB continuous recording , observed 24 hours appx recording and its is good at night vision and 360 coverage.
I have set it to auto reboot every day and still the data is intact and no issues observed till now",5
"Best one at this price, its response is good and motion detection is very responsive, it record without wifi if we use memory Card",4
"Dont buy this camera it would recommend MI CAMERA than this
This is worst one camera i am using
I want to return it but no options also i am not able to get warranty claims.
Camera problems - 1. Bubbling while rotation
2.no or very less and laggy rotation
3. Poor video quality
4. Lost wifi connections
In conclusion dony buy this DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT ITS TOTALLY WORST.",1
"I had to do lots of research to arrive at a Good Camera that I can place inside my home for security purposes.
And Tp-Link Smart Cam did the work for me.

I am writing this review after a couple of months, and so far it has delivered what i expected.
Notification on Motion movement, Night vision, Pan from remote, everything is working fine.
I have inserted a 32GB storage which I keep backup or delete once a week.",4
We have purchased this product for the purpose of keeping an eye on the visitors and it really solves the purpose by sending a notification directly to our mobile phones everything there is a motion near to our home entrance. Just loved the product.,5
This camera is good with its app but does not work with alexa. TP link will make u download multiple TP link camera apps to set up with alexa and teach skills. It just did not work for me alexa was not able to pick up the camera so returned the product.,3
"Easy to install.. Perfect application to use.. It took less than 10 mins to connect and setup.. Night vision is amazing 😍.. Resolution is good aswell.
Night Vision 10/10
Resolution 10/10
Application 8.5/10
Motion Detection 7/10
Go for it",5
"Excellent product.
Pros:
1. Easy to install
2. Good picture quality
3. Night vision
4. Push to talk and two way communication capability
5. App has lot of different facility

Cons: Chinese product",5
"Though the camera is cheaper than MI's camera, there are a lot of disadvantages on buying it. First of all, the camera does not record sound, that is, when you run the playback, you cannot hear the sound. Secondly, if we want to run the live feed on Tapo app continously, we have to refresh the feed after every 5 minutes. Also, MI Home app has much better range of features than Tapo app. The main disadvantage of using this camera is the Tapo App.",2
"I got it for 2199 INR, On 03 Feb 21. This is simply amazing piece of system every house should have. Either place it any where in the house or fix it in the wall,
Motion detection recording & Alert, Alarm System, Night mode, Easy Connect to Wifi, Live Monitoring, Calling & Alert Options, No Hassles of wires running through the house, Simple enough that can be hidden out of eyes.",5
"Supplier sent used cam/ the box was not sealed as well as the base of the camera was fixed already. Vertical movement worked and horizontal movement was not worked. I hope this is the problem from supplier/ vendor who sent the used as well as non working cam.

Requested for replacement and the new cam is working fine.",4
"This camera do not connect to my wifi (i also tried manually connecting, spent half a day)- how can I rate it? even I cannot return and get my money back; only replacement is allowed. Waste of time and money ordering this china product.",1
"video quality is good. but it doesnt auto-track. it doesnt move with people movement from left to right. this means that you have to manually move it from your phone, which is not possible to do everytime. to me personally, this is the biggest drawback. hence 3 stars. if this feature is not important to you, then everything else is great. easy to install on the app.",3
"All the features are amazing.
Works really well.
Motion detection is top notch.
Night vision is exceptional
Setup with the app is pretty simple.
For this price it's a good buy",5
Continuous power and network is required. Live video can be viewed only with same network connection. Micro SD should have been more secure as it is placed outside and easily removed by anyone. Overall it is an average product for my requirement.,3
"First and foremost, the picture quality is great and interactive. But what's the most downfall of this product is, it keeps getting restart issue and after every week it goes to non-functioning aspect. It keeps on going to the red light blinking and gives me hell of a time to connect again. I hate to the most. It is for my convinence not to give me pain. Everytime it goes to offline mode. I thought it's from the house of Tplink and it would be great product but u fortunately it's worst thing I have come across.",1
Product meets with purpose for which it was bought. Motion detection is fine. Image clarity and colour when lights on are real. Goes into b/w mode in the dark. Memory card works well. Overall good purchase,5
"A nice product , Actually intent to mount upside down . At least 1 Mtr radius around the camera area not visible
Night vision to color vision transition is a big question , Up to 9 it shows B& W vision",4
Why this does not connect with Mobile hotspot why WIFI connection is mandatory. First time it has connected through mobile hotspot and gokd vision later it does not support without WIFI connection.,1
"Third class product.
It works only for few months then stops working suddenly. It will work only for first few months, in that time it will earn reviews and one day it will suddenly stop working.
Most of the times functions like rotation, night vision won't work.
Cheap quality components used.
Really feel cheated as the company does not honor the warranty.",1
Very basic camera. Audio quality is poor. Works fine but frequently looses network connectivity. Requires very strong network and close placement to router. Otherwise its a good camera with fine video quality even in total darkness. App is not so intelligent.,3
"I purchased this wifi camera for my entrance despite knowing the fact that the camera is made for internal use. After using it for 15 days I feel satisfied with the product. Camera quality is not very good for outer space, however I did use it in my room. In good network connection, it gives good result of HQ (high quality) but if wifi connection is not stable , the picture quality becomes low. Its microphone is also very good. I give it 8 out of 10.",4
Camera worked fine for 2 months only and then it stopped connecting to our home Wifi. We have tried all options given on net like connecting to 2.4GHz but it is not detecting our wifi itself which worked for 2 months. Very disappointed. Please think again before buying this product,1
Best quality image in night mode. Very good responsive from tapo mobile app. But sharing the live video is not possible. Parents can’t see the video stream at a same point of time.,5
"An Amazing product with flawless Tapo app. Night vision awesome..

Some minor disadvantages, movement of camera over any connection other than local wifi is slow.. works only with app, no web page support . ..",5
"I liked features such as only video recording when motion detected, good night vision, horizontal and vertical rotation of the camera through the mobile software, motion detection notification feature (which can be disabled as well), scheduled video recording, sharing recordings as video or photo.",5
"Looks nice, very easy to setup and works seamlessly with the app.
I have tried camera controls, presets and talk back microphone system.
It’s just out of the box and I don’t see any negative about the product.
One thing which is missing or can I say good to have is have at least a digital zoom built into it...",5
"Refund option not showing faulty camera received ,always showing error offline but not able to View live its damaged products our Wi-Fi speed is higher, its cheap wast of buy, do not wast your 💰 and time.",1
the app could have been faster. it takes 4 or 5 seconds to load the live feed even on a good connection. also need 5 ghz support. also the Google assistant feed is 5 seconds delayed. please improve your app connectivity,5
"UPDATED COMMENT:
The price came down back to the normal price and I bought 2 more.

OLD COMMENT:
All good. Except the price. Increased by INR 200. Maybe need to buy the Mi Camera.",5
The camera does not turn based on motion or human tracking. Its static and the tech support is also bad. Not recommending this product.The customer care people just pretend to help u ..in reality they dont even get back to you.Cheap Chinese product.Dont buy.,1
You can't operate it without wifi If keeping disconnecting from the wifi again and again. It will take 10 minutes to the complete setup again and connect with the app. No online help found.,1
"It has major connectivity issues, once the connectivity beaks with wifi, it never switches back on, you have to reinstall the device again and again, so whenever you wanta to access the device remotely, it will never work.

Dont waste your time and money on device.",1
"Best that you can get at such price. If only viewing is your priority, go for it. For communicating, it’s a weak product. Voice quality at speaker end is not so good. Again depends on your priorities and budget.",5
This camera is good.. While in office i can watch my toddler whenever I need.. This is for indoor use.. Dont have cloud storage but I like this product,5
"Never used any security devices in my life. This is my first and oh boy do I love this.

I got this for 2k and the features it has are mind-blowing.
1). Night vision is superb.
2). Only records when someone is in motion in its FOV.
3). Great picture quality, Can also save some memories if you want them.
4) Bang for the buck.",5
"Camera quality is good,and clear view.nice at this budget.power is also quite long.
Dispointed me is that no NAS facility available. MI cam provide at same price.
And only class 10 memory card are accepted by cam rest no other memory card is accepted,so again have to spend 1000 rs more for memory card. And no cloud storage facility..",4
"Using for the past one year ,no complaints.Night vision is gud.picture quality is ok.
I had bought one C200 & another C 110.
Tapo c100 has wide angle & saturated color in comparison to C200.
Seamless pairing and setup.",5
"Impeccable night vision, motion detection and tech support. Perfect solution for my senior parents monitoring their rooms and surroundings at the touch of a phone app.",5
"For installation, you need a seperate wifi connection. You have to install a new app in your mobile to see the camera. Mobile (in which app was installed) wifi/hotspot connection can not be used to connect the camera.",3
Very expensive for this quality 3200 is too much...it can be no more than 2000,1
Clarity n all is very good. Tilt feature is good. Two way communication is average. But the main problem is that this device doesn't support Cloud storage which makes this totally useless,1
Nice product worth buying my 2 cameras covering approx covered 1000 sq ft area .best in range though bought this for 2499 each but .. it is an awesome product ..u can rotate it 360 degree from it phone app. And even tilt it .. pan zoom .. call n tlk back features are just worth it .. received yesterday only .,5
"Awesome wifi camera good clarity and app is too good.
Wifi connection is needed for best results .
Night vision works well.
64gb memory card added working very good",5
"Best product its night visionen is very good
It rotates very smoodly. The Is also Good Lots of Functions Like Motion Detection and You get a notification Straight On Your Smartphone.
Must Buy ❤️",5
"Its overall good. Video quality is also good. Rotation is also good. The bad thing is motion detection. Any fly or something passes through the camera, our mobile phone gets a notification, but we can switch off that setting. But it's not worth ₹2,500.
If internet is not there then the recording would stop. Better buy a wired CCTV camera",5
Product quality is good. Visibility and night vision is also good. i have purchased 2 cameras. i have been able to connect only one camera with the TAPO app the second one is not connecting even after trying in different locations. No technical support available to solve the issue. The sellers should look into the issue.,3
"Good camera.... Recording option for motion detection not proper and play back not user friently but otherwise good. Also it rotates automatically, that also not accurate, bacause of this missing some important video footage. Also if primary wifi connection is down, no option to connect automatically to a backup connection. Also no cloud backup option. Changing one wufi to another is difficult",3
"Very impressive product, the night vision is beyond expectations. Motion detection is quite responsive, it is less than a sec that I receive the message on mobile.",5
"Firstly I would like to thank amazon for superb fast delivery and thanks tplink for this awesome wifi cam which is an overall Hero of security as I was awstrucked with the sensitivity of the cam motion sensor which sends instant feed ASAP motion is there! 😳🥳🤠

Tapzo application works like a charm and very user friendly and ui is awesome for control REMOTELY!!!! Using my mobile data

I am gonna hook it with my Raspberry pi and will share my review regarding same.....",5
"Duplicate product sent through Amazon as it is only replaceable,not returnable. We could not link it with the app as the SMS/email with the link never came. When I called the helpline number,it automatically got disconnected after 30 seconds.",1
These 2 devices were temporarily (10% of the time) unable to detect the required wi-fi network on which they had worked before. All possibilities were attempted then. But they would just not pick up the network even from a close range and on some occasions even after resetting the devices. 2 other devices were fine. Time for warranty.at least!!,2
"Every where written full hd but camera only takes 720pand there is no option in app that its shows it's full hd.
Camera hq is worse I don't know other option may be more worse
Pixel are broken .... I think camera is 1 mega pixel",1
Working flawlessly and can monitor remotely the happenings indoor 360 degree rotation help to see the complete area. Lens quality is good and night vision is superb and we could see everything for 10 feet . Very simple to setup,5
This Camera is the best choice in replacing conventional CCTV. This cam rocks and the inbuilt microphone and speakers work fine. Its been 4 months since my purchase no malfunction or problem. It does the job!,5
The best camera in this price and performance over internet networks. With continuous loop recording and many advance features like alexa enabled usage and many more. Super happy with this tec,5
"I was purchased this tapo c 200 camera and refund two times. Problem is while talking and calling time , unnecessary more sound was coming like whistle,",1
"Lacks pairing by LAN, gets unpaired often unlike the other TPLink cameras.
It has to be paired again. Reminds me of some cheap versions available in the market.",2
"Motion sensor and night vision is impressive,

cons:
-sometimes not able to see with my 2.4Gz airtel internet in listed wiffi (however at same time I can see all neighbours Jio 2.4Gz internet connections :) )
-support only 2.4Ghz internet",4
"Quality is good but whenevr you are out camera gies on offline mode. Wifi, system updates everything is fine but still shiws offline mode. I restrated it multiple times. Still offline. Suddenly it shows online but offlike most of the time. Provided feedback multiple times but of no use. Nobody resolved my issue. Worst produxt from TP Link. Returned it",1
"A grt cam,
I would like to share that in a few months the cam stopped working for some reason, I took it to there service centre and they replaced it immediately.
Grt service and grt customer service",5
"Worth the money, bought in discount at 2199/-.

Night vision is epic.
360 pan is useful, motion detection is very accurate.

Have been using it for a while now, no limitations observed yet.",5
Setup was easy with tapo app you have to buy memory card separately. There would be some buffering delay mic and speaker is working fine. Enough adapter wire length.,5
Over all good product. Hardware is good and Software is very good. Night vision is not so good. (My Sri cam IP camera clarity is better) little better than this. But overall all good.,4
"It is not worth for Balcony as it's range is very short, the faces of a person moving on the street is not recognizable.
, actually I could install today in my balcony, but found it is not worth , if possible I want this to be returned and will buy another one of longer range.",2
Product malfunctioned within 60 days of installation. Lodged a complaint over email and received an automated token from TP-Link Support-[TKID210323110] on 22nd March. Yet to receive any support or phone calls. Horrible tech support.,3
"1. Doesnt allow me to record in HD
2. Not able to access from app.
3. Too much lag if connected from app.

Not expected this from TP link",1
बहुत खराब है क्योंकि बिना राउटर और इंटरनेट के इसे उपयोग नही किया जा सकता है मैने इसमें पैसे फशा कर गलती की है आप ना करे,1
"Way below expectation. Video feed lags by good 3-50secs. No continuous feed. Feed on the app stops and asks for refresh every 30secs.
And it’s not because of wifi. Camera is connected to 5ghz which delivers more than 100mbps speed.
Extremely dissatisfied with the product.",1
"After 7 failed attempts to register my email id to the product
Finally managed to
Now comes the hard part getting this camera to set up.. I’ve used tp link from ages
Never had any issue
Modems, routers extenders",1
"The mic and speaker need to improve... When ever we switch on, the camera rotates 360 degree and returning to default position. So we need to adjust everytime..",3
First time when I tried it got installed easily after some days it became offline and then I reset and it started working and after some hours it became offline after which it is not connecting. Motion detect gets very slow it reacts after 20 second at least. Technically it is not connecting easily. So wouldn't recommend to buy.,1
"Camera device is good no issues in camera.
But the Tapo Application used for viewing this camera is not much faster & not opening promptly.. especially whenever my mobile is connected to mobile data. But camera is always connected to my 100mbps router",1
"Amazing Product! This Camera is exactly what you need if you’re looking to buy a WiFi cam for your place. The installation is easy, the interface is extremely user friendly, the Tapo mobile app works great and the picture and audio quality are also pretty good. Go for it!",5
Good night vision for home. Motion detection prompt.,3
Not so good....always get connectivity from mobile and router after every restart....very difficult to manage..and so bad customer care....not any response even waiting after 15 to 20 min.....not got for it...go for mi camera....mi camera is very perfect in comparision...,1
When the power goes off and later when the power is back the Tapo app shows Offline and we have to manually restart the device for the app to be Online again.,1
"Can not connect with laptop hotspot/wifi.... It wasted my 3 hours...it connected with Mobile wifi , clearity is good,audio is ok ok, I don't have wifi router but tried to connect with laptop hotspot...but it couldn't be done.",2
Glad i bought this product. Works smoothly. Clear images even in dark. Easy set up. Does not move or swivel. Good enough for monitoring. Value for money.,5
"Without wifi (internet) it will not work (e.g. no recording). Even after a quick power fluctuation (From main to inverter change). It will stop working. and you will have to reset. Total useless. Keep doing the reset work multiple times even in a single day. Second drawback, camera capacity is less than 1 MP. Even There is nothing mentioned on product or box about the capacity.",1
"Great. An overall product replacing a hectic CCTV installation.

Only drawback is, only one user can pan and tilt camera from remote app.",5
"Nice clarity
Nice night vision
Motion is quite clear more than expected
Very Easy to install
Works good with google
Overall no flaws 5 stars",5
"I have been using it for a month...
This product is too good and if we disconnect the internet connection then it continuosly record in SDcard and the picture quality is also good but the output speaker not so good ,there is an to much echo in output audio but it was an temporary,it was fixed by a update.
overall it was value for money at ₹2,199 thank for read this comment",3
"It doesnt detect 8 out of 10 memory cards. Luckly one of my 32gb card got detected..otherwise
I would have to buy a new card not knowing if that would work.",4
"It is amazing product. .must buy.. very easy to install, you can forward or download recording from your mobile.

The only limitation is that you can't access recording from laptop.",5
"Easy to use, easy to install, easy to setup. Motion detection works great. I will recommend you to buy this but only if you have wifi(Not like jiofi hotspot but like jio fiber router). I have jio fiber router and it works great. I can use it from anywhere.",5
Not happy with the purchase. Fitting parts are not present in the box. Camera quality not good. There is no return option This is very wrong.,2
Use more than 8 GB class 10 SD card only. I have been using it for one day now and I find this device useful. Seller has been really prompt in response. The camera has all the necessary features.,5
"With firmware version 1.0.14, the camera has bricked. Multiple customers have faced this problem and TP Link is unable to provide any solution.",1
"Night vision range is limited
If used indoors, this should meet the requirements, there should be an option to mute audio during transmission or recording. Rest is ok",4
"I did a mistake by reviews and following hype created around this camera. My previous Sricam is giving better clarity than this camera, holder for camera is more convenient and you can connect through LAN cable.

In this major issues are:
1. Quality not upto the mark
2. No adjustable holder for camera
3. No LAN port -Only wifi",2
"Great camera. Very easy to setup, and use. PTZ works perfectly. Had very good experience using other TP-Link products also. Reconnected easily after a power failure. Dependable.",5
"Great product. Easy to install and with micro SD card, the recording function works very well. Very good for installing it inside the house. Go for it.",5
"Camera does not stay online as expected, Internet connectivity is around 10 MB/s to the camera still it says offline even if we are on same wifi network.

Except app and camera connectivity, everything seems satisfying.",3
Wonderful deal on this 360 degree CCTV. Easy to install via app and easy mount brackets provided. Motion detection works perfect and also the one way mic.,5
Fairly easy to setup. The picture quality is very good both in the day and at night. The app is very good and stable,5
"I ordered this camera and found out that the rotation was getting stuck at a certain point. I ordered a replacement and to my surprise, the replacement product has jerky motion and sound as it gets stuck. I am returning the product now. Not recommended.",1
"Without memory card its working all fine.. Since i put 64gb HP SD card it works but after few hours it stop showing SD card have to reinstall the SD again n again.. Tbh idk the prob is with thw card or the camera..
The only thing i wish this camera miss is the ability to watch live on Pc / Desktop",3
Absolutely worthy product. the application is also good. night vision quality is good but it does not capture upto 30 feet. camera speaker & mic both are good. only issue is it wont run on mobile hot spot. it needs wifi (another network.),5
Decent camera..satisfactory..however sd card fails to be detected very often which makes it a bit unreliable.It is fine for live streaming,3
"Night vision is in greyscale. Everything else is superb. Has talkback, pan/tilt, motion detection and sd card recording and more",5
The camera was not supported sd card. So i have ordered for replacement still waiting from past 1 week. Very bad return and replacement policy.,3
Ive been using the device for more than a month now. It's working absolutely fine with no problems. Night vision clarity is excellent. It's got amazing features like voice call and buzzer. My friends were fascinated by the performance and they've order it as well. Thank you tapo. Will require a couple of more devices. Will order soon,5
"It could not able to conected to wifi even by a CCTV technician i asked for refund they said (amazon)
No return replacement only",1
"I bought this product and it is beyond my expectations.

setup for camera is easy.
monitoring it from phone is easy.
There is tapo app for this camera which will help you monitor and control the camera which is well designed. 5 stars for this product.",5
Very good product.,5
"Very nice product,worth for money
Very good quality video recording and very good nightvision also.
If you enable the motion detection you will receive a message to your phone very strong motion detection

Overall an excellent product.",5
Good budget CCTV Cam you can get at this price. The Mi model stands at the same price as this one. Choose according to your likes. Thanks!!,5
"I am using Mi camera as well. When it comes to motion tracking. Mi is best even without sd card. But, this tp link, it's completely useless for me.",2
i bought this camera one month ago for 1600₹. the quality is good. features are amazing. motion detection is pretty accurate. but the audio quality is not good. it lags while playing previous recordings. overall it a good product in this range.,4
"Works as discriped. Bit time taken for setting up. Don't waste time buying 64gb and above memory Card. Supports only upto 32gb.
Rest all fine",4
Nice camera.. only issue is that it doesn't have a cloud storage. Otherwise fantastic... Voice function is not very high quality. I loved the product and its cost effective,5
Built Quality is great. Perfect View at night. The good thing is adapter wire is very lengthy. I got this at rs. 2099 in lighting deal. Worth buying at this rate.,4
ideal for home security. inexpensive and easy to install and use. anyone can install and use it. no need for any special assistance from supplier. i installed it all by myself,5
"What I got in my hand!! OMG!! Amazing! 👏 Very easy to use. I can access the camera from wherever I want, I only need the ""TP-Link Tapo"" app installed in my mobile. Though it will be written on your outer box. I connected this camera through my mobile Hotspot and it is working well.",5
"Using it with 32GB SD card, working fine, all required features are there and working good.
remote calling, motion detection recording option, notification enable disable and all features are working seamlessly. over all a very good package. i feel worth buying.",5
Cannot be used on dongle though dongle speed is good,4
"PROS:
Camera quality is Good
Night mode is Good
No connection issues

Cons:
We have to connect with adaptor.
No windows support,
But Still We can see with rtsp server in Vlc player.",5
"Initially it worked fine. After an upgrade of firmware, it started showing SD card as problematic. But recordings are there on the SD Card. The TAPO mobile app is unable to playback.",3
"The camera in continuous recording mode is good. But the motion detection mode, the time stamp saved on memory card is not correct. So, cannot depend on time stamp.
Need to improve app a lot.",3
"After 3 months, now cam is not recognising the wifi signals. Not able to connect and function. What to do",5
"Very bad video quality, lots of time video recording not save in memory, too much software problem, don't waste your money",1
"It does not connect to all the Android phones. I have redmi and samsung phones and is constantly giving network unstable error message and not being able to connect to wifi ,whereas it worked for vivo phone with the same wifi router. Don't know what is the issue and nothing is mentioned about the device configuration.",3
Its been more than 24 hours since I have received the delivery and I am still attempting to connect it for the 100th time. This cam just refuses to connect to the internet and I am fed up. I have done all the permutations and combinations to connect it to the internet. Its frustrating.,2
Fab product. Good quality easy to install and setup. Go for 3 pieces. Works in one app.,5
"No second thoughts before buying this product.....It is amazing....
I use it for my child's safety and it is completely reliable...all features are as stated...",5
Cant share the camera with someone else. I use it as a baby monitor and both me and my wife need access to it. But it can be logged on from just one account. Though we can both login from one account. But it should have an option of sharing if i wish,3
I received used or open seal item. Screws missing. I am not satisfied. But item working good.,2
Stopped working within 1 week of purchase. Replacement done with 1 month time to reach. Then again stopped working . Overall not durable. When it was working it was fine all features but it should survive at least for 2 years.,1
"Image quality is good, live streaming needs high internet connection for hd.
Worst part is the camera mic.",5
Everything is going good but sharing control is Missing we can't provide control to shared device it's the disappointment. In Mi camera provided this fecility,4
awesome ... easy to setup n use .. very good picture quality .. excellent product in this price ... hope it lastsits worth,5
Good product but night vision is not so good. IR led not so bright. Detection is good. Overall nice product.,5
It’s a good camera for work and house . Works well . Very easy to install. Best part is it can controlled remotely and can be panned 360 degrees.,5
"Good camera for basic use. Clarity is good, I have installed in my balcony but it’s protected from rains. Working well after 5/6 months of purchase.",5
The best wifi camera,5
Wonderful product. Really nice app to support it. Good night vision capability. Sharing of real time visuals permitted only to maximum of two at a time.,5
Excellent night vision. Easy to install. Just have to buy memory cards beforehand. Has this feature of marking spots for quick rotation - liked it.,5
"Good product clear pic qulity, night vision is also good. For recording u have to use SD card. Should provide cloud storage on charge basis.
Will love to buy few more units. Waiting for outdoor bullet camera launch",5
"Stopped working in a month .
Very poor customer support/tech support. Called them 3 times and reported the issue, they'll be saying you will get a acknowledge mail from us.. so that you can courier the product back. But still didn't get the email.!!",1
Must buy for home if looking for voice with cam,5
"For inhouse security, nothing is better than this camera, hassle-free connection, and easy to use. The picture quality is great and the camera is very responsive for every motion it detects.

You will find it even better than the MI camera,",5
"Siren not work,most time camera offline apps show mobile 4g network . Memory card not support. Only work local mode wifi",1
Very nice product. Excellent quality and range. Voice call feature is added advantage. Only thing desirable is- if we can control camera movement from app.,4
"Excellent quality video. In spite of good (100Mbps uplink) Internet speed, streaming is lagging in the recent days.",4
"The camera disconnects when electric goes , or internet is not there . After that it doesn't reconnect . We have to reset the device again and connect back .
I have to travel 20kms to my shop to reconnect . Worst camera",1
"I tried as per the installation instructions and the camera got connected to the app.
I am able to control the tracking of the camera from my mobile but unable to view any video.
No live steaming too.
Customer service is responding but not able to answer to the specific issue.",1
It worked fine for a day but when there was power cut the camera stopped working. Now its not getting connected to wifi. I tried to call customer care of TP link India but they are not reachable. I m returning this camera as it is of no use if it cannot connect to the wifi automatically after the power outage,1
"This is an average quality camera.
The quality of the HQ video is so so.
Not a very good cam for sensitive areas",3
"It was good initially but after 1-2 month's of use, i have to setup it again and again. It doesn't detect in tapo app.",2
Value for Money. Till now facing no problem.,5
Received the product on 11-11-2020. The product was not in good condition. Seal was opened and some package components missing. Product looks old and looks like used one. Didn't tried to use the product after seeing these issues. Asked for return and refund for the product.,1
Facing problem in frequently disconnection from wifi..,1
In this camera still motion detection.. and I want when motion is detct the camera follow to motion.. so this future is not available in this camera.. so I m return back.. all other is good,2
It serves the purpose. Good picture clarity and audio is not upto the expectation. But overall it is worth buying it.,4
Excellent in every expect. Hassle free installation. Connectivity is wonderful.,5
"great camera... clarity , night vision, sound capture all r good... it was so easy to setup also...",5
"All the mentioned features works pretty well. Awesome price, good picture quality, night vision is pretty good. The biggest con is Live View doesn't work on mobile data. It will work on the same wifi network, but refuses to load on mobile, which is one of the reasons I got this camera.",2
Camera video quality is good & easy to intall but more technicalities required for watching the live video over mobile,4
Hii. I got my camera delivered on 3rd march 2020. It was working smoothly but few days back the memory card not getting detected by the camera and now it is not powering ON. How to avail the warranty...plz help,1
Priorly before replacement they gave me tamper camera which was not seal packed didn't had the guide book camera was not covered with plastic.It was just a damaged piece which was delivered .,3
Product is good. But it having memory card recording issue. Initially it records well when you insert memory card but after few days it failed to recording even if you set loop recording. I checked with support and found that similar problem occurring with everyone,3
Initially faced some problem in installation because of our wifi settings bt once installed it is awesome . Worth buy!,5
Very good budget camera. Motion detection is great wrt pricing. You can also set the video recording to be enabled during motion detection so it saves a lot of space. Tapo app is a cherry on the cake.,5
"Stopped connecting to home wifi after a week.
I have used other network cameras for years and wanted to try this one for another home. Worked perfect for a week, and then one fine day stopped connecting to the network. Can't return or replace now, so well-timed!!",1

Easy to setting the wall bo wired problem",5
"It detects very small insects and giving motion detection, false alarm",4
"Excellent product with superior performance. Only problem is that, after every five minutes, you are interrupted and you have to select YES to continue to watch video. Rest all is fine, recording is excellent with very good sound quality.",5
Product is good and 1 st time faced aome connectivity issues but thats not an issue now working charm,4
"Works quit well. First time setup with Tapo App had bit hiccups, but finally it works as expected.",5
Card is not working,3
Easy to install and use. Works well remotely. Compatible with Android and IOS devices. The tech support on customer isn’t that knowledgable. Overall a good purchase and safe bet.,4
"The camera is good
Features are useful
Easy to install
Very effective
Only issue is it does not detect motion or mov on its own..
Rest its a good buy
Talking over the camera is loud and clear",4
Wonderful. Much More than expected. priceworth. without any memory card we can save few minutes of video.Night vision also far better than expected.,5
"I have bought this product a week before and it is working as described so far, i'm really happy. It has many features including remote monitoring, video recording, voice call, motion detection recording, etc.",5
Very handy tool for home monitoring and security. A breeze to set and takes very less time to be up and running.,4
"Good camera, nice resolution... Very responsive motion detector...
Worth buying for 2100",4
"Interface needs to improve, connection with WIFI via camera was not even showing a success message despite completion.",3
The call facility is not that great. We cannot talk through the camera since the audio is not so clear.,3
Night view is not good that could be improved well..and rotation when power off and on.. everything is good..,5
Finally a product which is affordable and works really best! Only thing missing is that the app doesn't make a sound when a notification comes in... Else it is worth a buy definitely,5
"I didn't expect that in this price range it would be this good. Amazing device. Must buy..
So easy to use. Easy to install.",5
"Average low quality camera. Build quality not up to the mark. Bad camera Lens. Low video quality, side of the video is blur.. mic quality is bad destroyed sound.. No offline motion assistance.only TPlink software is good ... Better to take MI home camera for quality..",2
"It was working good but stopped working within a month, dead now total waste. Quality need to improve....",3
"Good clarity picture, easy to set up.

The playback in mobile app is bit confusing.",4
"Very nice camera tilt 360 degree,nice and clear view.Strongly recommend.",5
everything is good i am using this with 128 gb mem card but i think sometime it gives alert for non red zone area also.,5
"Video : Good
Audio : Very Good
Mic : Poor
Connectivity : Good
Cloud Storage : Not Available
Overall nice product in this price range. Have loop recording, 128 gb of storage support.",4
Great wifi camera. Does everything it promises. Hope it lasts a very long time. Truly worth the money.,5
Very good product but increasing the price is stupidity. The cost has gone up from 2k to 2400 which is ridiculous,1
Very good,4
More than I expected. Very good product and performance is also very good.,5
Using this since the last 6 months . No issues. U just need to connect to wifi and have a good sd card in it and that's it.,5
"Works as expected and advertised
Only thing I find missing is the option to view the stream in web browser.",4
Connection drops don't recover quickly or automatically requiring frequent resets. Pic quality and night vision is good.,3
"Very poor back end service..
Every 24 hrs tapo stops working again and again I have to reset
Waste of time",1
Worse camera ever. I have been trying rescan of Wifi network to connect my router during setup even near by but noting shown in the wifi list . Big problem is WiFi is not able find the list to connect my router,2
"Night vision is not up to the mark. But overall a good product, software is reliable.",4
2 months of usage and absolutely love it. Peace of mind after installing,5
Total money waste product is not good and service center too poor please don't buy this item,1
Nice one.. The power connection should have been given in concealed way.,5
"Good camera with high quality video resolution if proper light available.
Needs some new features which enables motion detection automatically according to set time.",4
Camera is okay with normal quality. Some times showing blurry pootage. Excellent packing. No SD Card inbuilt.,3
This is not user friendly camera...does not allow share person to turn the camera nor does it give the owner to control the kind of permissions to be given....,1
Useful as a baby Cam/Nanny camNight vision is very good.Motion detection alerts are almost a minute late,5
The product is really good.. night vision could be improved.. also major con is when mic is a recommend sensetivity it echoes all the sounds on your phone and cam.. very very annoying,4
"Software is not good,we can not use as web cam, can't connect to Laptop or Desktop, only can connect to Android Mobile. All storrage video footage only in memory card in the camera. Can't use for out door use,if any body taken camera,we don't know what happened.",2
The camera quality is great. Night vision is superb. Motion detection is accurate,5
"Could set up in few minutes, ensure you connect to the 2.4ghz WiFi during setup. Nice features helping you to setup markings and can share with family.",5
"The set-up is easy, but the technical support is non-existent.
Technical issues with motion detection, the camera is not taking pictures on motion detection. Please update. No seller contact avaliable, already tried to speak to tp link",1
It is worth to buy. I do not see any issues with camera performance and quality.,5
Camera stopped working within 29 days. Return window also closed and I do not know what to do now.,1
Mostly it does not work. Connecting to home WiFi is just next to imposible. It does connect to your Mobile Phone. You need to reset and setup it again and again.,1
"Good product , but can't use outside , not water proof.
Also it can be installed your gate side ,but you can't view your footage when you are outside as you are. Not connected to WiFi .",5
the product seemed like good quality but it has not even been 1 month and it stopped working.,1
Easy set up and start. Works ok need stable wifi.,4
"A very good product. For such an affordable price, the camera has very good features including the video quality. It removes all the hassle of having to setup all the wiring and installing a server.",5
Memory recording in SD card stopped in between while recording in between.,1
Excellent product..it's cost also very low compared to other products..don't hesitate..just go for it..I guarantee it..,5
"Great product.
It would be better if it was battery operated system.",4
I am not able to connect to camera WiFi at first stage to pair the camera with my phone. Pairing is not all at happening.,1
"This was really very useful, I used this to monitor a covid relative.. 2 + 2 people have access to view",5
"Good product and crystal clear picture.
Night vision is also excellent.",5
Feel cheated....Everything is fine but when you loose the wifi link. It stops working..had reset multiple times but same behavior again and again.,1

"I haven’t seen an ill designed product as this. Has a complex setting up process and takes ages to set up. To make it worse, it has to be re-set every few hours. Won’t latch onto WiFi and requires only 2.4 GHz band a sod every household has a techie sitting there. Their feedback and tech support is equally terrible. Fortunately, this came as gift to me else I would have rued upon money spent on it. Overall, not recommending to anyone.I am rating this product bad despite its picture and motion detection abilities.",1
"Camera is good. Quality is good. But one problem is, recording not support motion detection and normal recording same time. If you select motion detection, when detect motion then recording .if you select 24 recording then not record motion recording. Mi camera or cp plus e21 have a both recording",4
"Well it’s worth the money , the clarity is good , night vision is also good and motion detection is awesome. It is really worth the money and it does it work well. You will not regret and it’s compatible and works well with google nest also.
I have two phones and I can watch LIVE on my both iPhones.
I am using it as my entry way camera and really like it . 👍🏻",4
I have never seen such a useless product. Don't go on reviews better you judge yourself before buying it since it is non refundable so total waste of money. Better u buy cheaper one that is far better than this. If u contact them they will not even help u.,1
"Initial report
Good looking
Easy to set up
Two way communication possible although mic is not strong
Motion detection good
Camera resolution good but night vision has to be checked as initial impression not good",4
Brilliant product. Best for it price. The output is outstanding. Very satisfied. I use this as a baby monitor. It detects motions brilliantly and helps us identify when the kid is awake.,5
"Best product. Beat all other brands in this price range and Quality is above imagination.
Night vision is very good.
Motion detection is very very good",5
Most economical CCTV monitoring system. However storage and retrieval is the key issue. Storage is limited and need to remove the card physically to access the recorded footage. Need cloud storage facility of wireless access to stored video. Otherwise this is easy to set up and gives you superb pictures and video.,4
Reset automatically when ever I switch off the camera.. always ask to setup the camera again. I dont know what kind of function is this,3
It's a good product if you are willing to buy it must buy it by my side it's worth of money,4
"Excellent camera. Can hear very clear like phone speaker, both the ways. Vision is very clear in night as well.",5
Excellent product... For home use... 👍👍 Go for it... Motion detection is very good... video Quality is good... It's app interface is best in its class....,5
"This camera is good for detection,video recording, rotatingbut worst in sound wise, too much vibration in sound while recording videos.",2
"Hi, i bought TP link tapo c 200. Its 2orking good. Problem is the base plat broken accidentally. Can i buy new base plate anywhere? Please help me...",5
Great value for money. Works as expected. Nice software for remote access,5
"It works as expected, no glitches with the intended smart camera features, value for money. Got it with echo show 8 combo.",5
"Overall best recommend to everyone and nice video quality ,nice visibility night as well as day recording is also good",5
"I am using this in office , good working, awesome night vision, but I don't know why notification is not coming while motion detection .",4
"Tried conecting this device, first thing it does not connect, if it get connected by chance it will get off line and does not work. Not happy.",1
"Best in Class, Perfect in Night Vision and Has best mic for Audio Input.
Thanks TP Link for the Reasonable Price.",5
It is a great product. Everything works well but there a bit of distortion in sound while recording but that's acceptable.,5
Best product in low range i am using it and i recommend this product to my all naighbours and friends,5

Chinese product,1
Good home camera with excellent night vision,4
I have a question when a person is detected in camera it records only for 8-10 seconds why,4
"Cost aspect:
I have been using 3 Dlink HD wifi cameras. any paying 190/m of cloud fees for past 2 years= total cost of ownership = 190*24 +2k*3 = 10+ and it doesnt stop
With this the camera cost 2.2k + 700 sd card. that is it. all features are the same.

the mobile app and camera features are better then the dlink camera.

best thing that you can pan and tilt",5
"In one word it's just awesome and best camera. Before buying I search and gather information about cctv camera .And then i contacted some local cctv provider for my store..All are local cctv provider was told me a huge price for cctv approx 18k to 22k so when i told then about IP camera they said it comes high price but good. In my locality every shop have cctv camera I checked them but believe me all are waste of money no clear picture even day time face is not clear .And maily issue for me is wiring .DVR camera comes with many wire and big hardisk which is very bad for me.So i bought this camara with 128gb memory card now you check my night picture what a clear picture . Beside medicine shop owner check and said what is this how can be too clear they have DVR camara which is not clear and also not watching from home..It's cheap and best i can control from my home with internet.
Pros :
1. Clear night vision ( Check my photo)
2.cute look..
3.Control from home
4.SD card recording i can watch from phone no need to insert laptop or like that
Cons :
1 Only sound is very eco so road side shop is problem
2 .I used storage 128gb but 24/7 recording block 8 gb per day so calculate it",5
"This is a good security camera for indoor or outdoor purpose in covered areas. This is not a weather proof camera and needs to be used in covered places only. The day vision is crystal clear as is the night vision. It automatically records any movement and stores the video on the SD card if coupled with an SD card. We have been using it for over a few months now and is working great. It has been useful at times especially when we were out of our home. Go for it without a second thought, its a good product from TP-Link.

Verdict
Picture quality is great for day as well as night vision
Stores videos of movements
Can be coupled with SD card and hence need not buy cloud space
Can be operated on network any where around the world

Cons
None actually that i may have come across hence 5 stars",5
"Not working properly.Hangs alot. Buffers alot.SD card not detected. Motion detection videos not recorded, what is the use of security camera then. Complaint raised thrice, no solution provided. Rude technician ,did not visit for solution till 2days. Calling at night, not ready to visit for solving the problem, asking for product picture/ bill copy whereas customer care clearly stated to only show the bill & not to give copy. Worst product, no after sales service. 7days of purchase the product hangs up everyday. Continue beeps sound comes while listening mic sounds. No clarity in sound. Takes alot of time connecting to wifi if we want to see live camera at 12.00am it will connect till 12.10am. while other cameras in the same room connects within seconds. Deleted the app thrice & deleted device connection even more times to get smooth functioning. But it did not get better. Disappointed with the product. I want refund. replacement not required",1
I have been using this camera for 7 days with 128 GB SD Card inserted. Motion detection is slow responsive and cannot schedule only Motion Detection Recording between midnight 12:30 AM to 5 AM. Still cannot tell about the rotative motor used in this camera.,3
"Bought it after comparing features with similar camera from mi and others,
And I am very much satisfied with this, I am able to monitor my house from anywhere and ability to move camera helps as well, night vision works awesome as well",5
Motion detection fine...night vision better then my fix cameras...technical support I needed not..worth buy..do buy..,5
"awesome looking vision is clear and clearity is awesome
i m using MI camera this model but in between two of them i prefer this one TAPO camera is best for recording and
voice call speaker is not expected not too voice but it is worthy in this price and i dont need speaker to call

thank u TP LINK and AMAZON",5
"Good product for mid range price. Built Quality is good as well as picture quality is also very good, software is little laggy need to improve",5

"I purchased tp-link camera c200 on 03aug 2020 all over good up to 01month but after app update issue raised fr camera pan/tilt (camera rotaion) feature is disabled fr all family members working only fr single member which used at the time of installation regarding this problem I am writing mail many time but the situation as it is till today so I request plz* don't buy this camera after sale user service too much poor no one help u if facing any problems in camera, wastage of money.",1
"Definitely Value for money but have some cons, display used in camera is very cheap means it looks like a distorted view and you can view it better by closing your one eye😉😂😂😂. Second thing, video quality is definitely not 4k it's something between 720p and 1080p but is good overall considering the price. WiFi function sucks as their app DV King doesn't work well and your phone gets hang repeatedly forces you to close the app and ultimately uninstall it. I would recommend to buy this cam only for those guys who are having a tight budget and want to give a try for an action cam. Or else go for a Pro.",3
"Being a short movie director, wanted to shoot a small film at my Farm. And I had bought a couple of 4K action cam but found them to be normal HD and not 4K and hence returned 1 of them. Just heard on social media that a brand named FitSpark was selling Real 4K Action cams. At first, I was a bit sceptical to buy the product but when I saw the price…just 5.5k, I thought it to be a steal deal. To test, I shot a video of about 20 minutes. When I saw the recording on my 4K LG TV, I was just surprised to see the clarity. The quality is splendid! No compromise done on quality. The build of camera is good and with rubberised soft finish the grip is really good. Plus the water proof case provided with this sports cam is of good quality and it has button controls on the case so you can shoot easily with case on. Another plus is that I got all the accessories (almost 16-18 pcs) which I would ever require to use this sports cam. I am very satisfied and would highly recommend! 😃👌🏻",5
"This a good camera at this price range photo and video quality are really good, unlike others if fitspark would have provided external mic that would be an added advantage.

Really great picture quality",5
"Bought it for three reasons, mainly for under water
PROS:
1. Usually 170mm lens is fixed in most action cameras. This one can be adjusted to suit your need. Apart from 170 mm wide (fish eye) one can also choose between 'middle' and 'narrow' perspective options. Middle and Narrow options have a closeup perspective something like a 50mm feeling.
2. It has a Sony censor and that is a big plus. Even some of the most talked about action cameras do not have sony censors
3. It has 4k 60 fps/30 fps apart from 1080x1920 for slo-motions etc.
CONS:
1. It has no separate battery charger like in most action cameras and the battery lasts for about 40 to 50 minutes. One has to buy either an extra battery or carry an energy bank to recharge. At the moment extra batteries at extra cost are not available. I am told by their executive that they are launching an exclusive battery spares soon in December which can be bought separately. However Fit Spark eagle i6 action comes with a single rechargeable battery.
2. I did not find any external mic compatible feature as mentioned in the Ad.

On the whole it is a good camera compared to most well known brands in that category. Will be posting another review soon after recording videos in different modes. Fit Spark eaglei6 pro is a bit pricey though. Regards, Muralidhara, Mumbai",5
"I always wanted to buy a professional DSLR camera but since it is very expensive so I didn’t buy. And normally I shoot all videos with my mobile only. But I still wanted to buy a professional quality Action cam at an affordable price. This is my first Action cam.

The 4K video concept looked superficial to me until i recorded one with this & checked that on my Sony 50 inch 4K TV. And the quality is remarkable. Everyone in my family was delighted with the video clarity and details when we played in on our Sony TV

The camera quality is too good. It’s actually 4k ultra hd quality. Fully satisfied to experience the Real 4k quality that the company is claiming off.

The accessories provided with this are of excellent quality & ensures that i don't have to go into hassle of buying anything else to complete my new photography aspiration. Though I haven’t used them till now but I am sure these would be very helpful in future.

The product finishing is superb. You can easily connect it with WiFi to your mobile. Overall an Amazing product.

Now it’s fun to shoot with this little master ! Thank you Amazon and FitSpark for bringing such a wonderful camera 🎥 👍",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Warth and value for money. Amazon delivery and packaging nodoubt very satisfactory. In 4K 60 fps option is available.170 degree wide Engle available in 4K. In time lapse .5 to 60 option available.Batarry back up is good . I just like it. You may visit my youtube Channel, CCGA for its details video samples",5
"this review is being done after usage for couple of weeks.

first thing I want to say is that I am utterly disappointed with the camera.... the following are the good and bad about the camera.

good:
- economical price for an action camera but please read below
- delivered on time

bad:
- picture quality is very very bad
- for namesake its says 4k but the resolution, color, brightness, pixels writing/processing is very bad
- even the lower resolution output is very bad
- if you zoom in the 4k 30 or 60, you will find pixels floating... wonder if it is with my cam or that's what the quality is
- pictures is as bad as video
- UI is manual and badly designed
- battery has no indicators saying this much is available
- battery charge dont indicate the battery is full
- while the camera in action, it wont give you warning... it simply switches off
- when charging, it opens up camera and drains of all battery even if plugged
- it has WiFi but its a huge effort to get connected with the mobile using a hopeless app
- you take 4K 60FPS, but it shows 4K 30FPS on its properties... I enquired on this and the seller/responser says that its a bug in the software and if requested they will send the link to update the software.... the cam is made 7-8 months back and this could have been updated... uff you manufacturer, you could have sorted out this
- few accessories are provided but you will not find manual of using it...
- it just give you 50 to 60 mins of continuous video and wont give you advance warning
- tried all the settings from ISO, white balance, sharpness, balance etc but the quality remains very poor.

I would have been happy if the video quality is at-least good and rest remains as is.... Not recommended even to the beginner...",1
"It gets the job done! Don't think that it records a high quality 4K video, the detaila are not that good but of course usable. The video files are saved in the memory card in separate files not sure the reason behind it. Sound output from the device is almost near to 0. The sound recording volume is also 0 when you are using inside the waterproof case,perhaps just the holder will give more access to the mic for recording sound. Other functions works fine like a single snap,colours are fine not that good. Built quality is good,no flimsy buttons. The field view is sufficient to get maximum things in frame. It has supported wifi to connect any smartphone with this device to transfer data or control the camera. Once you are inside the media library,you can go one by one file to check the videos/snaps but you cannot delete individual files. Display size is good enough, battery backup is sufficient and takes almost 2h to get fully charged although its a tiny 900mah battery. When in prolonged use it gets mildly heated up but not too much.",4
"Being a wildlife photographer since 8 years now, I've been using top of the line lenses and cameras. I was a bit skeptical about the product for how well it will deliver. But I must say, at this price, with Sony Chipset on board, the camera performs really well. Auto ISO sometimes struggles in bright areas, but still can be post processed.

I dint wanted to spend big buck on GoPro, as I'm not a frequent action camera user, but those who are looking for an action camera for vlogging, biking, travel... this is quite a good product.

Cheers!",5
My elder daughter uses my mobile a lot for her amateur photography hobby. And I was looking for ways to curb her mobile usage. I gifted her this action cam and within two days she has completely stopped using my mobile. She is busy exploring the features of the sports cam. She has taken photographs of nearly every tree & flower in our entire society. Earlier she used to spend entire day on TV & laptop but now she goes to the park daily. The video clarity is splendid and it’s easy to transfer the videos to computer. I would suggest more parents to give such things to their teenage children to encourage their creativity,5
"To shoot good clarity videos, I used to rely on two options till now. Recording through the Smartphone was a convenient option. While on other days, full hd camcorder used to serve the purpose. It was good to record with them, but not the best as they couldn’t be mounted & one had to hold the camera firmly to enhance the stability and avoid camera-shake issues.

I knew that an Action Cam would be the best option as it has several types of carry mounts available. But I wasn’t able to find any brand which was low priced and had a great quality. Recently, one of my friends had bought a FitSpark Action cam. He was totally satisfied with the quality and experience.

Through his referral, I bought the same and was excited to use it. The build quality compared to the price point is amazing. It is so compact and very stylish. The best thing which I loved is the Point of View Angle. Also got the mounting accessories kit with it. I used it as a helmet camera while cycling in the morning, tied it to my pet’s neck collar to get a view from different angle.

When I transferred the videos to my laptop, I was surprised to the see the output. The results of the video were mind-blowing. The 4k 30fps recording was up to the mark. Action cam’s built in battery is also very good.

I loved using this product and it’s actually a great option for beginners to learn video shooting skills!! 🔥😍🤩",5
"Though the camera was similar to any other Chinese product and I found it is just a rebranded 4k camera with no specific support structure.

The details in the manual is diferrent to the one on the packaging as on the packaging it was mentioned that the product support iSmart DV wifi camera app. For beginners this app connects to the camera built on iCatch chipset but unfortunately it doesn't and as per the manual you could use XDV as wifi camera app (used for SJcam) but it also not the app that connects the product to the phone.

For help I tried calling the number on the fitspark website but found it is switched off and later sent an e-mail to their support e-mail address for no support.

I regret my purchase and foremost, I have asked for refund/replacement but the Amazon people are delaying the pickup.",1
I shoot professional product videos and already own GoPro and Canon cameras. But nowadays I have to shoot a lot of outdoor videos and it’s not always handy to carry very expensive equipment so I was looking for decently priced but a very good quality action cam. And I must say I made a great decision by buying Eagle i6 - the video clarity is professional 4K and upon testing on my 4k monitor I found no pixelation - it was indeed genuine Real 4K. I compared my own old videos shot on high end cameras and the video shot on Eagle i6 was amazingly good quality. The video compression was good and transfer speed was also fine. I plan to buy more pieces of this action cam for my other staff. I highly recommend this camera 🎥. “Keep it up FitSpark - your product is a sure shot winner “,5
I am an amateur photographer and use my mobile but it’s difficult to use during rains and outdoor travel on motorcycle or at beach - infact got some water damaged in my iPhone 7plus during last trip to Goa. So always wanted to try an action cam which I could use freely without any issues of rain or water. And I am happy to use Eagle i3 - though I have not gone outside Delhi but still I have used it during rain in my terrace and found it very useful as it has good video quality. This action camera is quite good.,5

 Sample:
youtu.be/s86SvuDVwUY
youtu.be/zBqNqLWz1aw

Pros:

CAMERA
- it has the good color saturation
- a total of around 5 straps along with 4 zip ties and a steel wire is awesome
- the lens and two screens come with plastic protective coverings (needs to mentioned as some other cameras didn't have those)
- it is compact and good
- Remote Control makes life easier
- Image stabilization is awesome (you can see the sample video I uploaded)
I was expecting a separate option to toggle 6-axis gyro apart from EIS
(So I would assume the gyro and EIS turns ON simultaneously)
- There were no lags in the video (there was a lag once when I was using it at 2.7k 30fps [see sample video])
- not a big fan of the finishing (SJCAM4000 had a better rubber premium feel), this camera has everything made of plastic
- the fact that you can view the video files details in the camera and the ability to delete unwanted footages is worth it (very useful)
- you can run the camera directly via a power bank without having to insert the camera battery (Very useful)
- the front camera is a simple screen (without touch)
- a stent makes it easier for you to simply attach it to a tripod instead of using some other camera casing to attach and use a ton load of switches to mount that on a tripod.
- you also get a discount on your next purchase of the External Mic by fitspark (ONLY if you rate them 5 stars)

Cons:
- Footage captured at 4k,60fps turns out to be 4k@ 30fps
- AND the footage captured at 4k,30fps is really 4k,28.3fps
- The lens glass protrudes out of the camera so you have to be pretty careful or you will scratch it when placed next to objects. So let's say if the device decides to fall with the front face facing downwards, then the first thing that will hit the ground is the lens glass.

- 13.9MB per second is the speed I got when copying from iMAX to my Samsung SSD via USB cable
- The bicycle handle mount won't fit on my Honda Activa i scooter handlebar (the screws are too short, BUT the ones I got with SJCAM4000 perfectly did, BUT I will give it a pass as they are titled bicycle mounts)
- When in a waterproof casing, once the screen gets OFF (while recording OR even if the camera is on and not recording) you will no longer be able to turn the screen ON unless you take the camera out of the waterproof casing and manually slide the unlock slider on the touchscreen. OR you will have to use the Wifi to connect to the camera via phone and then control the camera options through your smartphone.

When you turn OFF the screensaver then the screen never gets OFF, But now the battery drains faster and so

For example: if you start recording and the screen turns off then the only way you can stop the recording is when you unlock the screen and press the stop button

So even if there is no way to input touch through the waterproof casing but some sort of firmware update to manually turn ON the screen without having to slide the touch slider WOULD BE A GREAT ADDITION.
- a screen lock doesn't make any sense in an action camera
- NOT A BIG FAN OF BATTERY
a 3 bar battery can turn into a single red bar in no time

My Take or Advice:
4k 60fps - Perfect, if the camera is not moving and the subject you are shooting does
2.7k 30fps, (with EIS-ON) - Perfect, if the camera is in constant motion (swimming, running moto vlogging, etc)
1080p 30fps, (with EIS-ON) - Best configuration for moving camera
1080p 2x (Slowmotion) - It works and is ok
720p 4x (Slowmotion) - slows the footage considerably down and looks good too

Best for beginners, Good for early video creators like me.",5

 This is the best action cam I have used so far, awesome stabilised video.. true 4k quality.. underwater video is just stunning, you will get a lot of mount and accessories.. This is best camera for the price you are going to spend. I have compared with other brand and there is no comparison.. Fitspark Eagle is the best action camera of 2020..
I have used this camera for my moto vlogging trip.
Day time and also Low light video is superb..
I recommend this camera to everyone who wants to start vlogging or moto vlogging..",5
"I was supplied the camera with no battery
The battery was neither inserted in the camera battery compartment nor it was supplied in accessories
It is impossible to use/ test the camera without battery
It is for the first time that Amazon has supplied an incomplete article hence returning it

I shoot all YouTube videos with my mobile only. I always wanted to buy a professional DSLR camera but since it is very expensive. But I still wanted to buy a professional quality cam at an affordable price. The bought this 4K camera size is smaller but worth bigger. Now I shoot all my YouTube videos with 4K. Very much happy with it and I strongly recommend you to buy this cam.,5

 It's over all a good product ... For it's price , it is a phenomenal cam ..but as I landed on an accident and crashed my waterproof casing and called company for help, they just said pay 1000 rupees so that they will send a new one ... That hurted me a lot .they would have given it for a lessee price or even free...

Use 4 k tv to get full quality ...

Distortion correction
Image stabilization
Slow mo
120 fps
Etc works as per thier announcement ... Any way happy with this product.. hoping the company will contact me with a new outer case....😂😂😂😂

If they do so I will update it here",4
"Fitspark Eagle 6i is a good action camera at the price range of around 6500/- rupees.

Pros:
1) Good picture quality
2) Good wide angle lens
3) Comes with all the accessories and the waterproof case
4) 4K @30fps recording, 1080p @60fps is the sweetest settings for EIS and crisp video quality
5) Good quality EIS
6) Sony IMX386 image sensor has a good low light performance

Cons:
1) Battery Capacity is low, thus the battery backup is less compared to other action cams available online.
2) HDMI output is not clean and it is not 1080p or 720p, so you can not use this action cam as webcam using a camlink or usb capture card. Also it has not any options such as pc camera mode while connected to the computer/ laptop via usb data cable.

Overall it's a bank for bucks. I suggest who ever owns this action camera should buy extra spare batteries and the external mic.

I can not able to capture some pictures or videos outside because of COVID19 crysis, very sorry for that. Otherwise I could have uploaded some outdoor samples.",5
It is an amazing product! This camera is literally value for money. It gives really amazing photos with clear pixels. Delivery was also done on time.,5
"Very poor video quality, Stabilization not working, over heating when vedio record ing. I used this camera for moto vlog but i stopped that camera and i returned the camera to the seller but money didnt refund. I don't know what wrong with this. I planning to stop my purchase with amazon.",1
"THIS CAMERA OFFER GENUINE REAL 4K stunningly clear videos. I saw it first on my hp all in one (it has normal HD screen) and really liked the picture quality. Then I shot a long video of my kids dancing in the rain and I joined by kids (just to ensure that I got this camera wet in the rain). This time I saw the video on my Sony 4K 65 inches TV - I have no words to describe what I saw. This is undoubtedly one of my best and most satisfying purchases I have ever done on amazon.
Kudos to FitSpark for launching an international quality product at such affordable prices 🤞🖐⭐️",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 It's a great product and that too for this price! It's really 4k and 60 FPS. I had a doubt about it shooting 4k at 60fps and wanted to check it first and found out that it's truly great! I HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR BEGINNERS, if you are shooting outdoor, do not use auto ISO, use 100 ISO instead, to get the best result.
The best thing about the camera is the colors. It gives you true colors. BUT THE VOICE CANNOT BE HEARD IF RECORDED WITHOUT USING THE MIC, BECAUSE IT RECORDS VERY NOISY VIDEOS. THE BATTERY LIFE TOO IS BAD.",5
"Awesome Camera Quality , Video Quality Is Just Awesome 4K Video Quality Is Super For beginners Best Action Camera For Beginners For Everything Like Vlog , Motovlog, Slow Mo , Timelapse , Everything Best Budget Camera If You want See Results I'm youtuber watch review and all details in my channel channel name is ""thakerzone"" befor buy watch my videos on this camera

All Pros But Only One Cons

Cons Is
No External Mic Including In No External Mic Support

If You don't Need External Mic like me then you should buy this 110% paisa vasool item",5
"Fitspark Eagle IMax Overall experience is good as per the product packaging, accessories, build Quality, one battery is provided but 2 should be provided, 4k 60fps recordings is good need more stabilization, but EIS works only on 2k 30fps is good, didn't checked under water, compared to other camera like SJ, CAMPARK, FITSPARK EAGLE I MAX beats all the way... But works fine while charging but not safe.. facing little heating issue,.
Pros : handy, stabilization, picture quality and UI is best,
Cons : Need more focus on battery only last for 1 hour hardly after charging for 2 hours, 2 battery should be provided, accessories build Quality is not much as expected,
For ₹ 8999 compared to previous models or other brands for beginners good choice.. added a pic taken from the camera for reference.

"This was my first action cam for moto vlogging shoot purpose. I was a little bit unsure about the video quality, stability and noise cancellation of the fitspark product. I'm writing this review after a using it for constantly 12 days.

I have retrieved the files from the sd card and played in my Phone(Poco X3), I was just amazed. The packaging itself is an orgasmic beauty. No issue with image quality, no distortion, no frame drop, nothing at all. My speed was above 100 all the time, I tried it on NH@, if you are familiar with the road, you will know about the road condition, the jerking and other factors. I mounted the camera on chin guard of my steelbird air helmet. All the mounts required were provided in the packaging. There is literally no headache about buying the mounts from open market.
The wifi data transfer feature comes with great download speed, which is likely to help to restore storage in the memory card on the go. the display if the camera is good, the waterproof case is literally on another level.
The app provided for support itself is really good, for controlling the data transfer, system configuration control, along with its smaller size.
The image attached is for better clarification of the wide angle lens. It is a screenshot of a recorded video with 1080p, 120 fps.
They are not lying about anything.
Go for it, it will not fail your expectations.",5
"I bought this product only to have 4k 60fps but it's not.
Under setting you can see 4k60fps but when you see recorded video information. it show 30fps only.

THERE IS NO 4K - 60 FPS in this camera , I request company technical guy to tell me how can I record 4k - 60fps in this i6 pro...otherwise need to return this...",3
"Justwanted a camera for stability and clarity purpose. Saw the ad on Amazon and got promted to buy as I always wanted to buy a go pro model. The price was attaractive. Pros. Good for biginners whohave never had seen a camera.
Cons. Only good in bright sunlight and can't compare with go pro.
I had bought One plus 8t phone and that camera can't becompared to it at all one plus camera is century ahead . Secondly there is no touch screen very very difficult to operate in this digital World without touch screen.

One can buy for biggeners who has ambition in photography. But touch screen should have been there.",2
"Well the reveiw on youtube and 5 star rating its all are fake the product is not good at all, pixel is 480, its not 4k at all
Very poor image quality, so dont beleive on you tube videos and all that, its tottaly worth less product, even mobile is better to capturing a video.",1
"Honest review

Its alright with the video quality and the angle for Motovloging.
But main issue is its audio..
After purchasing its mic cost of 1500 which is huge, its just got scam with me. Means after using an external mic I am not experiencing any change. Rather. i am getting more wind blust. same extra bloody noise to the video. So i have a request to company dont let waste your customers money as they buy it by trusting your product and morever the money matters, that waa a huge money that i had spent and got wasted.
So my opinion for others is If you wana buy this product for making motovlog video then its not gonna be the one that you want,
but if you want it as a normal vloging video or dancing etc shooting then its the perfect cam according to the budget.",1
"I always wanted to have a action camera. Gopro is expensive and SJ & Noise doesn't have what i wanted. After going though each and every affordable camera for more than one and half month. I can across FitSpark i6 Pro which I got for just Rs. 6999/-. I purchased it in end of November 2020. Now the review part comes below. I have uploaded a review video with details on my youtube channel as well (Jaysenjx) you can go and check that also

1. Pros: (I will only be talking about video quality not still image)
-Its really a 4K camera with awesome image quality.
-EIS (Stability) really works as good as Gopro 7
-Lots of accessories but don't know how to use many of them
-Slow Motion and Time lapse works perfectly fine
-Can support upto 128 gb card used (64 gb card)
-Charging on the GO. Charge and shoot at same time, which is not available in many other brands
-External Mic supports (didn't tried it)
-Very easy interface no problem to handle it (As it my first action camera so I don't know many features, but its very easy to understand)
-Worked perfectly when I used it under running tap water (with waterproof case)
-Has 720, 1080, 2K & 4K
-Frames are 30, 60, 120, 240
-Real 170 Degree wide angle
-Voice is good while talking and walking but not at all recommended while driving (When on Helmet or on Bike handle. Hope will be good with external mic as Gopro also is very bad while helmet or on bike handle without external mic)
-Compatible with Gopro accessories and other local accessories as well.
-Camera body it very nice and durable quality

For still Image: You have to change setting again and again which shooting video and clicking image as you need to reset setting because different setting works for still image because of 170 degree wide angle. But image quality is too awesome MP 16, 13 & 9.

2. Cons:
-Battery really sucks, discharges at any time without warning and lasts upto 25-30 minutes of continuous shooting
-Rest no problem with the camera as of now.

3. Some alternative solution:
-Carry a power bank with you for continuous shooting. Rest if you check my Youtube Channel Jaysenjx you will find all you solution as now onward I am going to shoot with it only)
-When I received it the outer packing case was broken but its Ok because we require the camera and accessories and not the packing",5
Dual screen action cam. In this price range is the best option to bus. It will support 128gb memory card which awesome while shooting on the go. No memory issue. Very easy to use. Which I like most in this cam is slow motion function. Very happy to buying ☺this..,5
"Its a Fantastic Value for Money Real 4K Action Camera. I just love it. Am using 128gb sd card. Its cool.

Check out my unboxing and more videos youtu. be/b5ImtcLP_oA",4
This is my first action cam and I wanted to try a good quality but reasonably priced camera. I have used it to record few videos on my bike and made some videos in my house terrace - the videos were very clear. I found easy to use and the waterproof housing seems be of good quality (though I have not used it till now). I am satisfied and after few months I plan to upgrade. Will surely recommend this for beginners !!!,5
"Ordered this twice and received a defective product both times. The first time I ordered it, the box came cracked and the toggle up button was not working. I returned it immediately and asked for a replacement assuming that this was a one-off defect. However, the replacement was even worse. None of the buttons were working. Finally gave up and went for another company/model. The build quality of this product is extremely poor and there are no quality checks before sending it to a consumer! Stay away from this product!",1
"It disables image stabilization the moment you select 4K 60FPS, image quality is average, high speed / slow motion mode does not record audio, noise grain present in low light...and no HDR encoding. Easy to use, cheap and filled to the brim with mounts and accesories.",4
"Great camera in budget...
Dual screen quality is good.
Battery backup is ok.
Video quality is good and better than hero 8.
Plastic quality of all excesseries is also hard.
Eis Stability is impressive.
Extra battery & External mic options are also good step from fitspark.
Heating issue is not too much,depends on the weather,due to slow memory card it happens.
Overall Great option for vlogers...",4
"( More details visit my YouTube channel.. Knock around with Sumit )
First of all of is a budget action camera with some proud and cons.
Cons are
It will not give 4k@60fps
Battery backup is about 60 min
EIS and Distortion correction is not available at same time.
With internal mic audio is distorted at high speed
Pros.
Great stability
Video quality is good in class
Front screen is available like go pro",5
The outdoor shoots are great quality and the indoor shoots sometimes require more light (but for action cam this is ok as we mostly use it outdoors). I bought this for my son and he is spending more time with this sports cam. At this price quality is ok. I have not found anything negative till now. Hope to use it more when we start holidaying again maybe in next couple of months. Would surely recommend this to beginners !,5
"This action cam is really good for beginners, who wants to start vlogs.
Picture quality is good for this price range.
Stability is too good.
Built quality is very good.
Internal mic sound is great.
Battery last 1½ hours if you continously record.
Battery full charge in 3-4 hours
Additional battery needed if you want record longer time.
It can record 4k at 60fps which is its great features. The recording angle is 170°.",5
This camera size is very small.it should have atleast 3to4 inch size.. Picture quality is very good and technology also very good. Internal mike record very well.but too much audio noice is coming. Company should rectify and need remove audio noice. Good prodect for this price.if increase the size of the camera then we'll and good.This camera doesn't have external Mike support. That is the major drawback of this camera.,5
Good Picture quality and video quality is good .Battery backup is to be improved Spare battery should be made available or atleast give clear specification so that it may be purchased from market,4
"great buy for the price
Dont compare it with the gopro
Electronic image stabilization works fine.
Wanted a spare battery for backup but dont know where to buy. There is no option for that",4
"This camera works as expected from it. Good image quality, good stabilization and the best part is the insane amt of gear that you get for mounting and even a remote control!

So far happy with my purchase.",5
"Eagle iMax

Stability is class apart. 100/100

Colours are a bit bright. 90/100

Decent job. Good for beginners.",5
"If you already have used ADVANCE Action Camera then you won't be much impressed with FITSPARK ACTION CAM.

"Noise cancellation is absolutely awesome, works great with my Fitspark Eagle Imax. Thank you Fitspark for this great product. Great quality of videos for beginners like me. Wide angle is awesome too. I used 720p @60 fps and worked great.",5

"I already own a GoPro Hero 8 & wanted a budget action cam for routine use. I never expected GoPro quality @ 6999 but my recordings proved me wrong. Video clarity is superb at 4K@30fps & inbuilt audio was decent (I haven’t used ext mic till now). The 18 accessories set given is enough for almost any use. After GoPro & DJI Osmo, I would rate this as 3rd best action cam available on amazon today – Go for it blindly if you can’t afford GoPro
Suggestions – Don’t save money on SD card – buy a good quality U3 class 10 memory card & don’t be tempted to use 60fps – always record @30fps and it will delight you always !",5
What is warranty and services,1
"Superb Cam in my budget ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I could find only a couple of dual screen cam on Amazon - But both were too expensive and out of my budget so I bought EAGLE iMAX. It’s genuinely good camera with smooth stabilisation and decent clarity. Complete set of accessories is added advantage and didn’t need to buy anything extra. Strongly recommend to buy !",5

Few weeks ago I bought Campark X40 @ 14599 & after that I bought FitSpark iMAX @ Rs.8999 – both are exactly same & chipset is also same - but iMAX had better stabilization because of 6 axis gyro stabilization & ext mic support. Anyone looking for mid premium action cam should blindly buy iMAX – It’s a STEAL !,5
"My camera has stopped working it starts but goes blank after 5 seconds. Plz assist with address of service centernear me. I am from Goa.
Team Fitspark replaced a new camera and its working fine. Good video quality. Thx service team fitspark.",4
"Awesome clarity !

I have been using Eagle i6 PRO since last Nov., 2020 & it’s performance is excellent. No complaints till now and all my videos are very clear. Have just purchased extra batteries & will review them next week",5
Initially I bought a cheaper card and did not get good results. Then I replaced with Sandisk U3/class 10 card & results were EXCEPTIONAL - video recordings were 1000% REAL 4k @30fps - smooth and without any glitches.,5
Action camera working good. Picture quality quite good and working fine. Recored time is upto 1.5 to 2 hours then it needs to be charged. . .,5

"Very bad, i can't recommend this device, such a third class action, just to make fool every buy the have written 4k60fps, which is just in writing, that doesn't perform well.",1
"4k 60 fps is fake claim
All over okay in this price range
having dual display is a major cons else buy eagle i6",3
Best camera best 4k I have ever seen in that budget firtspark i6 pro 4k real one I have seen,5
"It'a very good quality action camera i have seen...
Best part of the camera is dual screen and 4k video👌
I love it❤️❤️❤️",5
This Product is best In this Segment Because it's clarity is awesome it can record upto 4K in 60fps and it's video quality is very clear,5

"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 4k@60fps video quality is brilliant and 4k videos with 30fps include image stabilization
videos are distortion free and faraway images of mountain top or valleys are also very bright and high resolution
most of accessories were available in the brilliantly designed box which can be used to safely keep it saving cost of another pouch or cover.
the waterproofing cover is also good quality.",5

🙅🏻‍♂️ | CONS :
—————
• Flash doesn’t pop out of the body automatically when flash mode is on 😅.
• It doesn’t charge battery at the same time while using the camera. (Which i hope in future updates will bring this functionality please fujifilm listen to this one)
• No functionality of using the camera directly from the Charging port.
• Battery capacity should be atleast 2500 mah as compre to 1200 mah for this i feel is very less.
• On e video recording session is limited to 15mins in 4k and 1080p 30 mins which I believe should be removed. (Again fujifilm please remove this limitation which can be done on software end itself)
• 4K quality need to be improve hopefully future updates will improve this.
• No fast charging 😩.

🙇🏻‍♂️ | FINAL THOUGHTS:
==================
I think its the best budget camera u can get also the quality of the photos are very top notch. Overall it very good to go camera without any second thoughts. Existing few cons which i think fujifilm can improve just with the software updates. Also, Please go and get XC 35mm f2 Prime lense its a day night difference in terms of optical quality then kit lense. Trust me. Fujifilm Lense are bit over the budget but they have the best lenses with best optical quality nothing can match there lenses.

💆🏻‍♂️ | PRO TIPS:
• Get UV filter to protect your lense from dust and scratches and also it protects your camera sensor from harmful UV lights.
• Always change lense in a clean environment if your r travelling and outside use your car inside to change it as micro dust particles on your sensor can give dark spots in your photos.
• Buy a squeeze air blower to remove dust if it gets to your sensor.
• Remove the battery when you r not using the camera for longer time period.

🐲 | ULTRA PRO TIP:
••••••••••••••••••••••••••
Get Camera sensor Cleaning swaps if your sensor is affected by smug or dust particles that are harding to remove buy squeeze air blower.",4
"Chose this over Sony a 6000 and fujifilm xt200 saved 25k and 10k. With this price you don’t get an evf but the screen is quite bright and no problem under the sun. Good for people who are new to photography.
Photos came out really stunning. Pretty easy to use. Auto focus is good. Battery back up is an issue.",4
"This camera is worth the money. The colors are so good. It feels vintage inside out. Also, its handy and compact. For all those who love to carry the camera everywhere they definitely need to buy this product.",5
excellent beginners camera with all functions that an enthusiast looks for. The best thing is the touch screen which can be opened out and made to face forward for vlogs and selfies.,5
"My first cemera, the best. One should buy it if you're a beginner. Versatile and easy to carry due to its compact size. Colors are just awesome and loved the design.",5
"hello every , i bought it recently , external mic is not working, please help",1
The camera is of very good quality. This camera is recommended for video and blogging purpose only though images takes from this camera is also of a very good quality. This is sure recommended for video lovers.,5
DISGUSTING BAG GOT TORN IN A WEEK,3
Good,5
"This small camera hosts a lot of grand features like 4K movie recording, fast autofocus, great battery life and a vari-angle lcd screen which were my requirements for shooting travel vlogs.

The image quality is also at par as it produces vibrant colors which needs no post processing.

Recommended for anyone who wants best videos/images out of a camera alongwith a small form factor.",5
"Images suffers from over exposure during light and blurred in low light. Shots doesn't come out crisp in auto mode. Very light movement results in blur images. Focus takes lot of time.
Battery life is average but camera heats up after sometime.
But, the pathetic part is the camera app. Can't imagine how one can believe in products of a company which has such a junk app.
Before you buy any fujufilm product, you will have to check out reviews of fujifilm camera app on play store. It's awful app and the company has just shut it's eyes and ears when so many customers are complaining.",1
at this price point camera comes with a lot of features making the picture clicking and uploading very easy.,5
"I used 35mm f2
great camera nd great picture quality
under 40k xa7 is the best camera u ever get
don't think to much just go for it
but u need a powerbank or extra battery
cz battery life is not that great
kit lens is good
but use better lens for better result
thank you bye bye hv a great day.",4
"It’s only a beginner level camera..When comparing with price and difficulty to carry, Better one is a good mobile phone..",3
Auto focus is not good for videography also the auto focus of face detection is slow. Overall the camera is superb,4
Excellent Made in India product .Seems equally good as the many times costlier Manfrotto slider,5
"The ballhead screw was of a bigger size and didn't fit on my camera. Had to return. do check the screw size with your camera or buy a screw adapter. The quality looked very good in hand and motion on the ball head felt great. Shame i couldn't use it and try for video shots, I'm sure it's have worked well considering the quality and weight",3
The dimensions of the base plate should be clearly mentioned. Besides the pictures should cover all the angles / sides,4
Good quality product but as mentioned in the description is heavy. Unfortuantely I had thrown the packing else would have exchanged it forward light weight one.,4
Great product for its price,5
not valuable,1
Very expensive product,1
It has fantastic height adjustment system. The total height is also ideal. The holding screws need a little improvement.,4
"Bought this 4 months ago and have been using it to mount my phone and shoot and videos.

Pros:

The adjustable height is great
Available length is great
The holder for mobile also has mobility to tilt the phone for an upward and downward angle (my personal fav)

Cons:

The only thing I would recommend is to be gentle while turning the screws/knobs as they are a bit fragile and you could easily break them if you handle them too aggressively.

Overall, definitely worth the price!",5

I have purchased it for my Nicon d7500 lens cleaning it's perfect for me and I was previously afraid of some reviews mentioned in it empty liquid bottle but the liquid is full on bottle with good packaging and good quality perfect so I give five star to it.,5
"The cleaning liquid is not alcohol like other top products :( No leakage like in other reviews. The brush bristles are coming off, so I fear if this could end up inside the camera lens when using the blower. Like other reviews, the pen has a soft sponge, just remove it and the actual cleaning tip is under it.",4

"Waste product.Its my genuine review since 1 week of my purchase.

1.Lens pen have brush with low qwality bristles and comes off when u clean lens or cam and stick inside
2.Brush is of waste one and it too have problem of bristles coming out.
3.Cleaning liquid spray's top just broke after five pressings and is the worst worst quality and now i had to pour liquid in to another spray bottle for use.

Only thing useful is the cleaning cloth,buds and blower.
Request people never to buy this and if bought u will feel guilty.
I was totally cheated.",1
Useless don't worth 500 very useless product can't even return this if you get broken or mission peace then you cant return it.,1
perfect,5
Do not buy this product very very low quality,5
Nice,5
1st time received with out memory card and pouch. Replaced it but next time received same. Now I want to completely return it because in q&a section answered that 32gb memory card and pouch free.,1
"I love it. Haven't had any issues with it yet. Pictures and videos are clear and sharp. Unlike some of the reviews I've seen on YouTube for the G7, stabilization is good and light gathering abilities of the kit lens not so bad. I'm using it for professional documentary film making and so far, I've had no complaints yet.",5
I'm quite happy with this purchase. The price has now been pitched at an affordable level. Real value for money.,5
"Pros - Nice product from every aspects.
Cons - Should come with camera bag and memory card.",5
"See the condition of package. The pictures will speak a lot. We had paid for the new camera not for a used or refurbished one. There was no user manual or related documents inside the box.

Update - next day we received replacement which looks new with all documents.",1

THIS IS CAMARA IS PREDOMINANTLY FOR BEGINNERS LIKE YOUTUBE VLOGERS AND SO ON.
EASY TO CARRY AND STYLE ENOUGH.
GO FOR IT.
THANKS.",5
"This is my first camera. I ordered this because of I am creating content for YouTube and I need 4k camera in low budget.

So this camera comes with huge features in it.

Pros-
1. Very lightweight
2. 4k support
3. Wifi support
4. Tilted touch screen

Cons-
1. Battery life is about 1.5 hour in video
2. Image quality is ok with its kit lens as this camera have 16mp only",5
"I was about to purchase a Nikon DSLR but an influential devil told me to go for the g7 for its 4k video abilities. I'm glad I did. Kudos to the seller n amazon! It's power pack...
Need more time to dive deeper. Cheers!",5
"This is a great camera. It's a small form factor and I absolutely love how light it is and the pictures it takes just out of the box are amazing. However, the USB data cable that comes with it is Panasonic proprietary cable. Understandably this camera came out in 2015 so back then USB-C wasn't as common... so we're stuck with this weird cable that if you lose, the likelihood of easily finding another is so less. I lost mine and I am stuck unable to transfer pictures to my laptop from this... the SD card reader in my laptop is busted and until I buy a new (USB) one of those, I can't transfer pictures. Am I dumb? Yes. But is this camera also dumb? Totally.",4
"Actually this camera is best in competeting and also in solo wise😄😄,,especially picture quALLITY is damn great ,untill you know how to use the aperture and ISO OR ELSE many as mentioned it as mobile camera because they don't know how to take the pi that's the exact answer to them,overall it's really a great and damn awesome mirrorless camera and also if it's paired with 45-150mm lens you will get a cine feel pics",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The first photos that you are seeing are taken with the camera and with 14-42mm kit lens.......
This camera is definitely a very good camera for beginners....
This camera also performs good in low light even with kit lens
You need to bump up iso to 6400
A little noise can come
But that's not a big issue as u can fix that in post processing or in editing software
Also the battery backup is pretty good
As it last around a day with full charge and it takes 3hrs to charge

To get the most out of this camera
Use the following settings
Back dial- for exposure
Shutter dial- for respective control in the mode(like aperture in A or shutter in S)

Then use F1 button for auto focus
As it can come handy while using manual focus

Use F3 for digital zoom

And you can use the HYDN mode in bright sunlight as it has wider dynamic range and in some cases better skin tones (sometimes the skintones look worse)

I mostly use A for photography
And A in manual movie mode also,
Some photos of my settings are also attached.....",5
"Better for Video Shooting, Budgetwise better 4K Camera.

If you choose photoshoot, go to Canon & Nikon",4
"Great Product.If anybody unable to register warranty online please enter dealer name as
Appario Retail Private Limited instead of Appario Retail Private Ltd then it will be shown in drop down menu.Then we will be able to register without any issues.I mailed this regarding Panasonic and Amazon and finally got a call from Panasonic executive and was able to register.Hope this will help all who are looking to purchase this great camera.",5
Picture quality is worst waste Mony😞 I will purchase this product January 02-01-2020 but I am not satisfied so I will be returned this product. But no accept my return request in Amazon costumer service worst,1
Cool product.. best value for money...,5
"The product is really good for beginners. i don't have any experience in photography. This is my 1st digital camera so that I really satisfied with this camera. The picture quality and the pixels are really great. Thanks you Panasonic for making the good experiences.

For the last one year I used this product till now no bad remarks. Every time I am wondering about the picture quality and the dynamic range when we look at the shoots :-)",5
"This is my review after 3 months.. its an awesome piece of gold.. has 4k.. good clarity, i am using this to shoot my youtube channel. Awome clarity, light weight easy to use.. need to set some manual picture grade.. only drawback is it doent have 120fps shooting.. remaining all superb. Must buy",5
"camera is fantastic in build quality and features. just buy one extra lens of 45-150mm if you need, thats it... you can rock !!!
drawback is the app. Image app, Panasonic pls consider, this spoils your product quality, very often disconnection and the UI of the app also boring, totally app is lazy. all we need is the app like DJI.",5
Everything is best at this Price n Value for Money But the Seller is not mentioning the Serial Number on the Invoice which is Critical n Important for warranty.. I spl to Amazon so they asked me to wait for 4 days.. Otherwise I will return this product without warranty.,5
Not met my expectations. Average Camera. No camera bag and memory card with the Package and You have to spend at least 2000 rupees to buy memory card and Camera bag. Auto Focus not works as mentioned. Average Quality. Not happy with the product.,1
"I have given 3 stars bcoz of the seller and amazon delivery. The seller sent the camera with its seal open twice which was very frustrating. But I didn’t return it second time bcoz the camera was fine. This camera has some nice features, you can use it for photography and videos both. Good camera for beginners.",3
"Poor quality pics and videos. We'll be getting better pics and videos by using some popular mobile handsets priced below 25k. Buying this camera, I lost my money.",2
"A great camera for filmmaking, I would not suggest this camera if you're into vlogging and all...there's a problem with autofocus its not that good...but yeah for filmmaking it's totally worth it because you don't need autofocus...manual focus is all what you need..",5
"This is possibly one of the best camera's out there if you are starting out with filmmaking. It is not preferred for Photography though, but for videography is works excellently. It has all the features you need to start off.",5
Yes. This mirrorless digital camera is loaded with almost all features which any professional level camera can have. For hobbits it's a complete course to study all features.At this price and features no other brand camera is available at present. Videography and portraits quality is beyond imagination.,5
"Autofocus is average but picture quality and video quality is best, best for creators",5
"Still one of the best cameras out there in the market both for beginners and professional users, has everything you need and is very handy too. The Lumix G7 from my side is straight up amazing. Great product to purchase!",5
"This camera is very awesome and first time I use a camera and this is that camera from Amazon orderedduring great Indian festival offer, received the package in 4 days. Awesome clairty I was fabulous seeing this and more options are there, need to check every option. But sad thing is didn't get a pouch and memory card, need to buy externally",5
"It's an excellent camera for beginners like me. The camera design is stunning with good grip. Image quality is excellent.
The only con is they should have provided a SD card and HDMI cable with it.",4
"This camera like a mobile camera.
Picture quality not good.mobile camera photography is better than lumix g7.lens not properly work.
Really waste of money don't buy..canon and Nikon is best.",1
Camera with excellent built quality and loaded with too many features. The picture quality is superb.,5

"I bought this for Rs.47,000/- next month they made it Rs.35,000. WTH ??? Companies shouldnt just drop price so drastically that it ruins our investment. There should be a gradual decrease.

PLz note my following review is entirely based on video on this camera as i didnt buy it for stills. Only a fool would buy this for stills as for the same price you can get an awesome Canon/Nikon DSLR which will have a much larger sensor giving you lovely shallow DOF and color reproduction.

Anyway, this camera gives you 4K quality that can almost look like a Redmi phone's 4K recording. Horrible green tinged or bluish tinged footage. So bad is its inherent white balance and color temp handling. No amount of tweaking will get you out. Panasonic cant beat Canons color science and natural color that you get from Canon DSLRs. Dont trust all the YouTube videos you see etc. They have shot those in scenes where the bluish tinge adds to the appeal. But show me good skin tone shots with this camera. Very rare to see. Unless you invest in a very costly lens maybe.

Also in a DSLR, lets say you want to have a certain wide angle lens, say that lens for your DSLR costs you X amount. For the same effect (with no shallow DOF bec of its miniature sensor in the G7) and angle of view in the G7 the lens will cost 3 times as much.

Im planning to shoot myself for buying this utter waste of a camera. Only after buying it did i realize that the color tinge etc wont accomodate for all types of shots. Whereas in a DSLR you can do cool temp shots and lovely warm shots. The amount of noise in the video (color & luma noise dots on the video for laymen to understand) even in average and well lit rooms will drive you crazy. Especially with yellow pale walls and browns. The final will be murky and with rough noise in it.

How do i know all this. 9 years of experience in Photography & Videography. Trust me or not, dont ever buy this. You can go for a full frame or APSC size mirrorless camera instead from makers like Sony/Canon/Nikon etc.

Thanks for reading this. And wish you all a sensible purchase.",1
Panasonic G7 has a veru good built quality and feel solid in the hand. It has 4K video capture capability while being very good for still photography.,5
Value for money. But autofocus can be better.,5
"Touch display helps alot, and u have in build guide. Lense is also enough for normal photography , There is no additional attachment or safety bag in the pack, not even a memory card. That's a really big mood kill. Because as soon as you hold the camera for the first time you want to click but you can't because at first you have to go out and buy a memory card for it. In this price the product is superb. But 1 more thing Amazon charge you for gift wrap and don't deliver in gift wrap.",4
A very good camera for the price. light weight and very comfortable to hold. Display screen is good but the viewfinder screen is even better . Still digging through the functions even though the automatic mode does most of the heavy work.,5
good quality image and performance. Very much happy,5
Price very high..If it is 31000 or 32000 it wood be purchasable.... try it Thank you.best of luck guys bye,4
Nice one and a prompt delivery from Amazon.The picture quality was good.I gifted to my son.He was soo happy with this Mirrorless Camera,5
Value for money,5
This is the perfect camera for videographers,5
"This is written on the basis of 3 days experience with the unit.

The packaging was secure enough - with a wooden cage type support box encasing the product box.
The package contains the box and a adapter cable (pin type 5v .4 amp output, like your early nokia chargers). The adapter cable length is about 5 feet.
The box is having powder coated metal on all sides except front, where it is having a toughened (but not very thick) glass panel/door. The door has a lock mechanism, but does not do much as the handle is somewhat rotatable and one can rotate the handle so that the lock can be taken out of the hinge. Two sets of keys are provided.
The panel has a rubber gasket in the backside (similar to fridge) and also have some magnetic attachment to the body, so that even without locking, the panel will not open on its own.
There is a display panel which shows the temperature and humidity inside. Could not verify the accuracy of the humidity level but temperature readings were accurate. The display does not have any buttons to control humidity, unlike in larger cabinets...And you have to open the cabinet to adjust the humidity level from the controller unit inside.
The controller unit has a rotary knob with 5 ranges. For camera equipment a setting of 40-50% relative humidity is suggested and I kept it between that. The readings were stable within 3-4 hours. A green led is provided to show that the controller is working.
The backside has a outlet of sorts which needs to be kept uncovered and clean for proper functioning, and it also has the inlet of power cable. There is NO light for you to see inside (like bigger cabinets have).

Overall the build felt solid enough. The box weighs about 8 kg (without anything inside).

I would suggest to keep the cardboard box and thermocols in case you need to relocate with the box, as the breakage of front panel will render the unit useless. I am deducting one star for no outer panel buttons and no light inside the cabinet.",4
Awesome product & beautiful packeting,5
"Very nice product, very classy in appearance and easy to use! As far its capacity is concerned, you can easily fit a body with grip, one 50mm to 85mm prime or macro, with a 200-600 mm if you remove the partition. Must buy!",5
Worth Product. Better than expected. Operation is as simple as that. Accommodate all my current accessories :),5
"It's small if you have a large kit. Not suitable for very humid cities.
I am talking about full frame bodies and full frame lenses.
It is for beginners, who have 2 camera bodies and 4-5 small lenses.
If you have big lenses like 70-200mm, 24-70mm or more than 2 bodies. You need a bigger size.",4
"1st of all i would like to say that the packaging done by the seller was top notch, and the product is just wow..I am getting plenty of space for my things. You might got confused between Andbon and Hiniso just like me, both are of same quality actually both are good brands, but if looks matters to you as this thing is kind of showpiece then go for Hiniso it looks much more premium than Andbon and Andbon comes with 1year waranty but this one comes with 5years of waranty which gives you more metal peace. For cameras and lenses its a must buy😊",5
"Well packed in a wooden carton.Fast delivery.Well finished product,working well. Do not know if onsite warranty is available.Price higher in Amazon than local dealers by Rs 1000/-",4
"BEST DRY CABINET FOR YOUR EXPENSIVE GEARS & LENSES , THE PRODUCT WAS WELL PACKED INSIDE A WOODEN CAGE TO PREVENT IT FROM DAMAGE. ALSO QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT IS TOP NOTCH WITH POWDERED COATED METAL. ONE CHARGER AND 2 KEYS ARE PROVIED INSIDE THE BOX. YOU CAN BUY THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT ANY HESITATION.
THANK YOU HINISO FOR SUCH AMAZING PRODUCT AT A GOOD REASONABLE PRICE.",5
"It's been a few hours I got the dry Cabinet. To verify if it works as told I placed a portable humidity reader. It brought down the humidity from 60 to 45 in span of 2 hours. (Knob controller is on C-D) temperature wise accurate. Humidity wise not much difference but gets the job done.

Packing and shipping was fast and good.",5
"Ultimate product specially built quality very very good with tremendous finishing.
Lock quality also very good. Noise free operation and very useful for photography gears. Value for money.

Fantastic wooden packing done by seller for protection of the cabinet.",5
Very useful product.. packing was very good. I have kept 2 lenses 1 is Nikon 200-500 and second is sigma 150-500 also I have kept 18-55 and 70-300 lens.. and Nikon D7000 body. Product is good and if someone is looking for it then definitely go for same.,5
"So so far so good. The packaging it was sent is was good . The product was not dented or scratched at all. The instructions are pretty clear. The size of 34 litres seemed much smaller than the 36 litre I have , especially in width and that makes a difference . I wouldn't have imagined the difference would be this much though.

So all in all happy .........it has been able to acccomadate 2 long lenses , full frame slr camera , 2 small zooms and one one prime . But don't think it can accomodate more .",4
"I bought this during Jan 2020, it was nicely working, but last month, the machine got swiched off, I then contacted the dealers through their website. It was miraculous response from their team. With our due conversations, I could spot the trouble. That was instant replacement of adapter. System is back on action. This is a true service to their customer. Kudos to them.",5
"It's a good cabinet,came in time and nicely packed. I don't know how durable and efficient dehumidifier is but I think I'll know it over period of time. Nice display with info. It has all the space for 2 full frame bodies and 70-200, 24-120, 24-70 and still there's space for 50 and 85",5
"Product build quality- tough and value for many
Warmth- Good

Recommendations- Go for it without a second think..",5
"Besides the fact that the product is useful and effective, We were pleasantly surprised at how good the packaging was... wooden frame and all. The product arrived very safely.
Infact, this is my second purchase of this product.. I had bought one a few months back too.",5
The product is really good. It's very useful. Those who have camera and a few lenses must buy this product for proper care of the instruments.,5
Does exactly what it is supposed to. Looks beautiful and comes with 5 years warranty. Special mention about the exquisite packaging by the seller using wooden crate to ensure protection during shipping. Ample space to store plenty of gear.,5
"Very nice product for a photographer
And use full product for keeping camera and lens",5
"No sound Wile working. Humidity comes from 62% to 34% in control switch position D within 12 hrs. But raised to 55% after switch off 3hrs. Compare to similar products, (3 w/hr) Current Consumption is little high (5-7w/hr), moreover I did not get any Warrenty Card or Original bill with the product.",4
awesome compact dry cabinet for storing your expensive camera gears and protection from moisture and dust. five star service from Hiniso. easy installation and hassle free operation. packaging was protective enough along with satisfying delivery by amazon.,5
Good one . But the display is always on. It is good if the display can be off and on when required which saves electricity as the unit is working 24 hrs.,4
"Very well packed. Product meets all requirement for me. 3 cameras, 3 lenses. Now to test how it behaves for the year.",5
Excellent product right for occasional photographer like me; small in size enough for the items I posses. Let's see how it works in mansoon in highly humid North East.,5
"It's a good product for my camera and lenses, it protects them from moisture and mould. It works easy and fine. No complaints.",5
"Very nice quality product, i store my 300 prime, d810 body, 14, 2.8, 24-120 & 12-35 lenses easily. And still have room for another mid range lens or body.

Thank you.",5

Two 50 mm lens, 2 Canon Dslr body
And more two 24-105 lens can fit inside.",5
"So, I wanted to buy a stick for my Xiaomi Yi 4K action camera. The original one from Xiaomi was too costly and all the other ones had too many negative reviews for me to go ahead with them.

I came across this one from Amazon Basics and decided to go for it. I know it's a Monopod but it can be used as a stick with 2 adjustments.
a) The position where you'll be holding will change and you will not have the cushion grip if you use it a stick.
b) You need a ball head, otherwise you can't use this as a selfie stick/action camera stick.
(Alternatively, you can search on Youtube for a tutorial on how to convert this into a selfie stick. Involves some work, but is worth it)

Pros:
1) Great build quality. Absolutely premium build quality. Feels really premium too.
2) The maximum height is more than enough for anybody. It becomes very hard to operate if anything goes beyond your eye level. I'm 6'1"" and it's perfect for me.
3) Easily portable. The cover is really good.
4) The cushion grip is a delight
5) Way better than others in the market.
6) If you're using it as a monopod, you can either choose to have the bottom sharp or flat by just turning the knob.

Cons:
1) Some people claim the screw to be a bit fragile. I haven't used this with my DSLR. If you're using it for your GoPro or Yi4k or any other action camera, and as long as you're not mishandling it, you're good to go.",5
"I purchased this for mounting a Smartphone 3 axis Gimbal for cinematic shots, it works perfectly fine as expected, Fast Delivery, Superb Quality, holds the weight effortlessly",5
"Solid, light and affordable monopod. The foam handgrip is very good and doesn’t become slippery with sweat.
The only small drawback is the fixed head, which can be solved by attaching a ball-head.
Highly recommended.",5
"This product is good. The sturdiness is wonderful.
Good to use cameras (DSLR) with not so heavy lenses. The pod can bear the weight but your hands will start shaking. Using GOPRO will be a cake walk and fun.

Nice product .. Yes it is value for money",4
"Item is very good and very light, it is sturdy and quality is good. I am using with 2.8Kgs Lens+Camera (Sony A7iii with Sigma 150-600MM Lens), if I pull out the lower leg completely, there seems to be slight flex but there is no movements at the joints, it quite and tight, once you open the knobs, easily the legs slide down.
Overall, I am satisfied with the quality and the light weight sturdy design.",5
"The monopod has sturdiness and is light weight.

It has a nice and sturdy screw to mount the DSLR.

It comes with a pointed base which gives you a firm base. The pointed base is effective even on a tiled surface.

Suitable for beginners and pros.

I would recommend this monopod.",5
"Overall ok. I have loaded canon 77d + sigma 150-600 = 3kg. Till 3rd slid monopod is stable and sturdy. But if u extend 4th level it is totally unstable and you can't use it.. this basics 67inc' is good for less than 2kg users.

Pros:
1. Very light weight, good for carry long travel/time
2. Hand grip holder available to hold monopod for safety
3. Button fix rubber and pin system is good

Cons:
1. Too costly compare to another monopod on amazon
2. Not good in sturdiness as mentioned in the product description
3. Handgrip is smaller and simply don't think it will come for long use

Please refer to my attached photos for more details",2
"I am not able to connect my dji osmo mobile on this
It was written that I can connect to any camcorder but that’s not possible
It has a screw which will not fit anywhere
Incase u have a solution you should provide a booklet or something",1
"Looks very handy and sturdy. Soft foam non-slip grip is very comfortable.

Not started using it as of now, but I am sure, it will last long looking at its construction. Dark anodized telescopic pipes are locked perfectly without loose gap, thus there won't be any shake while using it.

Comes in a cute zipper shoulder carry bag. Price is right.",5
This product is not working with any gopro specially with gopro hero 7 and only mount is working is at grip side i.e on heavy side of the stick .Where it need to fitted on lighter side . So that stick can be handled easily.,1
"Material, finish is good. good for smartphone. Note : buy mobile holder and swivel separately. fits well with DSLR. Bit uncomfortable with carrying the stand with DSLR. in the long run, it should be OK.
DSLR + normal Swivel + this stand : Not OK. Buy a better Swivel or heavy duty.",4
"Amazon basic equipment are any day better than those available at this range. The monopod has a real stable base which helps us to put even the heaviest of lenses and get a sturdy image.
It is worth the price as there are other companies which sell at a higher rate but cannot offer you the type of quality that Amazon has to offer.",5
"A good monopod for this price, extension length is also enough. if I just nitpick I would want a 1/4 screw at the bottom to place it on a tripod. I have used lighter monopods but then this one's in a budget, I got mine in a Lightning Deal. Do not go for the Prolite it is very heavy.",5
Well constructed but limited use. The so-called Prime day sale was a farce as I later found the price was the same as on any other day.,3
This is a Monopod not a selfie stick! Learnt it the hard way. You cannot use this like a selfie stick for action cameras. Cameras are fixable only on the bottom side which is infact the Top side for a Monopod.,5
Very good light weight product. I don't know how to use the pointed end. No camera able to attach on this head. I think the manufacturer wrongly made it. Quality was excellent for the product.,3
"Its worst product I buy on amazone because you people did not mentioned any where that you can directly use with any camera
It did not fitted on my Sony A 6500
But on your website you write it support all DSLR camera
It's screw size is not universal.
I don't know how can I use with my camera I am surprise that mid leading information you provide on your page.
Now I wan to return my money back",1
"Sturdy monopod but with limited maneuverability , you may need additional accessories for inducing agility on to this product. rest I found this to be a great product.",4
The product is good n very much helpful for beginners n specially mobile film makers.... But the packaging was worst as the parcel was open n torn.... The monopod was coming out... Srry to say but its not worth as far as packaging is concerned👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻,3
I Like So much... Super Products... Value for Money..... Its So Use full.,5
Haven't tried it but found the product acceptable. It is light in weight and can be very useful during handheld flash outdoor or indoor congested photography session,5
It’s a sturdy yet light weight gadget. I haven’t used much just on 2 trips and I love it. Gives you a fake drone shoot effect. A decent guy for any budding photographers or photo lovers. Best for making reels and videos.,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Good for smartphones and lighter dslrs only",4
"Not light weight and not useful
Can’t mount go pro or dslr
Useless stuff
And quality also not good",1

Highly recommended",5
"Very Nice Monopod, Amazon quality and authenticity. Some parts are of plastic but at this price point it’s really good. Main shaft and locking buttons are very strong.",5
Hi frnd.. Monopod is ok. But not able to fix the leggs or stand to the monopod.. It has the ball type screw at the bottom. Not able to fix x the bottom stand leggs whatever.. Pls help me,3
Good one. Go for it. Value for money. A little shorter when folded and lighter and this would have been the best monopod in the world. Still this is great and at this price no competition.,5
Ultimate Monopod it can hold my canon mark 4 with sigma 70-200mm perfectly light weight and strong Monopod,5
Haven't tried it in a real life situation as yet but hopefully it will do it's job when called upon...,4
I'm telling you Amazon is making the best budget products for people like us ans I'm happy to buy this product.,5
"A Good product. Good quality. Worth buying.
Only negative is the folded length of approx 22inches ... it's difficult to put in a camera backpack.",4
Good one for this price. There must have an attachment at the bottom part to attach a gimble. Because it's easy to handle from the thicker side.,5
"Don't purchase it . The camera socket is so badly made that it came out the first time I used it and saved my camera from breaking.

Don't dont don't purchase this product Amazon basic 67 inch monopod",1
Good sturdy product. But does not have a tilt or pan . Not compatible with Hero Action cameras,3
Probably not for heavy lenses but good for wide angle lenses. I'm using this as a boom pole,5

"Look and feel is good, But it contains the ordinary LED light without adjustment. The background is not pure white, its a kind of rexin sheet , They are not providing background color sheets. where the other photo tent products comes with adjustable light and multiple color backgrounds. while we take jewellery photos it is giving glare effect. sides are not obsorbing the reflections. unable to take professional snaps on this, instead you can go for less price photo tents which comes with nice features and various background colors. simply say an ordinary carton box with white chart inside is giving more clarity picture than amazon basics tent. Not worth for the money.",2
Bad quality. Grey background. Only 2 lights present. Does not let us return the product.,1
"fanntastic product.
Love the big size. There background spreadsheet and the lighting system is amongst the best in the market. Although relatively costly, anyone looking for a big photobox would find it value for money.
Still, I wish it was a bit bigger.

I have used a photostudio which is one fifth its price (Box studio Photostudio), but still I think it is a worthy upgrade for someone whose products are bigger.",4

"The product is quality wise good, and box is stable, size also Ok, convenient to operate, but the gray background still persists after adjusting the camera setting too. This is due to the lack of third light. Instead of two lights if 3 lights are given this problem could be solved. The two lights are insufficient to get a nice photo. Since it is made in China, I feel I paid bit high price. The adaptors lasting is a big doubt.",4
"NOT OVERALL SATISFIED LOT OF IMPROVEMENT NEEDED.
LOT OF MODIFICATION NEEDED.OTHER BRANDS OFFERING SOME MORE MODIFIED VERSION WITH A VERY REASONABLE RATE.PRICE IS ALSO HIGH AS PER THE PERFORMANCE AND ALL.",1
more colors of backdrops would help a lot like some of jewellery photos need black background and lights get hot too soon need to take breaks after every 3 or 4 products photo shoot so lights dont get destroy,5
Waste of money....don't buy....and also I got used product....no lights in the box it's clearly showing someone cutted the wires and removed lights....since returning the product...refund my money back.,1
"The light is insufficient due to which, background looks off-white. You need to spend sufficient amount of time in image editing to make your products look good.

A higher powered lamp (say 12W) might give better results.",1
Very good quality product by Amazon if you have little knowledge you can take good images and save your time I will shoot a video of this photography tent and post it on my YouTube channel very soon must have item if you are online seller,5
"I am not an expert in photography, but this product does its job. You just need to learn some basic manual settings of your camera and you are done no need to edit your photographs, i purchased this box studio to shoot photos of my product to sell online. Dont think twice just go for it",5
It's bulky and not easy to handle. Lights are not properly mounted so calibration is difficult. Not recommend for small object photography.,2
Light is dim and the white sheet for the background has marks on it. Its a faulty product i think or may be its this quality only what they sell. Just be careful,1
"One of the best buys till date. Was quite apprehensive before buying this, seeing the mixed reviews, but it is a lot more worth than its price! Able to do photo sheets without any hassles, fab quality and easy to maintain.",5

Good Product. Should offer more black backdrop and needs to be more fairly priced. I feel it's bit overpriced.,4
"Amazing product !
i use this studio box along with basic Canon EOS 1300D 18MP Digital SLR Camera to take my jewellery pictures to sell on online.
This tent is huge and has so much room to even take two-three products a time.

"Too expensive for the quality of material used.
Not worth the money.",2
"Useless item
Photo background looks dark lighting effects not property original color get fade

Dont buy it ! Total waste of money",1
Not useful. Just has 2 lights so on one side we will get shadow. Waste of money,1
Very Bed and expansive,1
"It is a Great product very helpful for the product photography as professional even by smartphone Camera
.
The best part of this is its portability as it got to foldings structure and takes very less space to keep it.
This product reduced my photography efforts to 80%. Now I need not to arrange background- Lights-tripods and all..

if you are an online seller and need to use photography just go for it. Believe me, This is worth for money.

Cons.
Only one thing I miss is that this product should come with a cover which can protect its sensitive inside white Background from dust.
as people buy this only if they don't have proper neat and clean studio space.

So I prepared the cover from local Caution maker which costs me another Rs. 1000 Rupees

Thank you.",5
"This product is very nice. I had one light box which was small.
