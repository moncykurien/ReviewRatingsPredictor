"Snap deal is great.I have been using this printer for more than a week. I would like to thank snapdeal for the prompt delivery and excellent packing. It came in perfect condition. The Ricoh Sp111SU is a useful and  perfect product. The size is good and fits almost any space and the operation is silent and like a breeze!. The functionality of the product has been really smooth and outstanding till now. It is userfriendly and easy to install and operate. All the functions like Copy ,Print and Scan have been working well and I found this to be a very helpful and effective product. Got it for under 5k in a snapdeal sale recently and I am quite satisfied for its value for money ! Highly recommend to any one looking for a good MFD for home or small office use !",5

"Ultra fast and exceptionally quiet.This one is not soo much popular model of Ricoh Series.. Ricoh SP210SU is much popular than this Sp111SU.. According to my needs I ordered this one.. 
After a Long wait I got the product with well packaged. All the mentioned items were lresent inside the box.. Its too heavy in weight.. Approx 18 Kgs..The Toner was fully filled.. I just go through the manual and got all the infos about the buttons on the Printer.. The most exciting thing is the ID copying feature.. Also the multi copy feature upto 99 copy with Display unit is great.. Now coming to the printing scanning copying feature.. 
1. Printing. There is some default paper sizes available but you can add manual paper sizes for printing.. You can enable Toner Saving to save toner.. And al last the prints are awesome. Clearly visible on toner saving mode too..
2. Scanning..  Yes 600dpi scanning is super clear.. You can not save onto pdf format.. But any third party app will do it easily.. Overall scanning is great. 
3. Copying... There are soo much features available for copying.. First one is the copy item.. Yes. If you have to copy a page with text only then select only Text copy.. If you have a photo to scan then choose Photo only.. And if you have Both in one page then select the Text with photo option.. Yeah its great.. Next one is to control the darkness of copying.. You can increase or decrease the darkness while copying.. 3rd one is ID copying.. 1st press ID SCAN button then scan the both side of the document 
 and then print it easily... Its really cool feature.. And the last one is Multiple copy.. Pressing the multi copy button and select how many pages you want to copy and then copy.. You can copy upto 99 pages.. 
I have TP link archer C20 Router which has usb feature in it. I have connected my printer to it and I can not print and scan through any devices connected on that router.... 
If you have same then you can do it too.. 

Overall I will say its really a good printer in its price. I got it in Rs 5800 only..  I will say go for it.. Best MFP in its price range.. You will not get any printer with those specs in this price.. So go for it guys.. They say You can refill upto 3 to 4 times.. But I called a Ricoh guy he saud we can refill more than that if we use genuine Ricoh toner power.. I will check that.. But 3 to 4 times is enough.. And yes the new toner catridge price is too high conpared to the Branded Laser printers i.e. 3500.. But I think its okay if we can refill more than 3 to 4 times.. 

So I will say just dont think.. Its superb printer.. Go for it..",5
good & reasonable price.excellent product nd very fast service......all in one. print copy and scan..    value for money..,4

"Ricoh laser printer.Got the sooner than the mentioned time but have to go to the courier personally to collect it. Thank God i live in a town otherwise it would have a been a big chaos. Then the printer didn't get recognised by the system, so have to call the technician. Even he could do nothing. I contacted a local technician who actually make it work.",4

"Not good Richo.i bought this product on 29 august 2017 and today is 05 09 2017 and still i did not got the service of my complaint which i suffered the same day i bought this product.
when i bought this product i received it after 20 days of order , and after that, product was not working properly,it was heating after first print and scanner was not working so i complained

so i extremely dissatisfied with the product and service both and i recommend others to think before you go to purchase this product or to avail the service of SNAPDEAL or RICOH.


thank you.",2
Good yaaaass.A very good printer for the offered price.  Though it is very feeble but serves well for home or small business use.,2
Printer ricoh sp111.Like yuo but,2
So bad machine.This one is not soo much popular model of Ricoh Series.. Ricoh SP210SU is much popular than this Sp111SU.. According to my needs I ordered this one..  read more,1
Old printer.not good product.driver is not install.and print slow.and cartiradge not full.,1
Pathetic service by snapdeal..Lost of money rubbish product,1
"This product does not even have a LAN port. It is completely misleading product description. I just wasted my 12,000 bugs in this useless machine. Unfortunately Amazon didnt honour return and I ended up keeping this useless product in my office.",1
"When I was needing for a printer which suits me , then I went on searching for many blogs, articles and videos that which printer should I buy then I ordered this one .

My requirements was - ( for a research student )
1) Fast Printing ( Duplex- both sides)
2) For longer use ( I don't use printer daily , that's why I neglected ink-based printers)
3)Servicing and Brand ( Servicing means , cartridge is easily available and affordable and the printer have brand )
So , I came with this one having all functions that I needed.
Now , Pros -
1) All above three
2) Better printing quality
3) Very easy to use , plug and play , can print 200 pages in one go

Cons -
1) Not have led lights .
2) I bought @13k , which I think is bit more ... It should be somewhere between @11.5k

I have used HP m1136, and other HP products , but 'brother' can beat them in Quality , Fast printing , Auto duplex and Servicing .

Go for it .",5
"I have been racking my brains for the last few days since I received the printer to find a fault with the machine; disappointed that I cannot find any. This machine has more sophisticated functionality than I require for my limited home office needs; the two- sided scanning and printing, the two-sided scanning of Id cards and printing of both sides on a single page are some of features that I can think of. Kudos to Amazon to make it affordable to me via its red hot summer sale.",5
"The toner cant be refilled only replacement, its cost is Rs. 3500/- every time. Pathetic after sales support.
Strictly dont buy this scrap.",1
"The description doesn't say this cannot be connected to LAN which is a basic feature for a printer. This neither has WiFi nor the LAN port. It's just useless and Amazon cannot accept the return. Its waste of money, NEVER buy this useless printer.",1
"Lot of people are complaining that it doesn’t have wifi or LAN. For their information, the connectivity type is already mentioned, that is USB only. It’s a nice product in 11k price range.",4
Writing this after 8month usage product is good but tonor filling is not easy if you do your self u need assistance for tonor filling so in this range there is no wifi but i print with otg cable print quality is good i daily print a book product is fine but i will be disappointed by that there is no backlight on lcd which is bad,5
"Product is good but its not yielding as many prints as they mentioned, not even near by the number 2600. in my first full toner it yielded 1600 pages only.

kindly provide me invoice bill once again.",3
"Very good product.
Auto-rotate feature.
Easy Installation.
Plug and print.",5
"Tldr: Printer is good, the software isn't great.
Bought the printer for home use. It was very easy to install. The instruction manual was detailed and the instructions to download and install the drivers on Windows 10 were simple. Installs easily on MacOS also.
Prints well, and is quite fast.
The Interface to scan is not too great. It's easy if you want to scan a document into a pdf, but images are a bit complicated. It was easier on my old Canon Deskjet.
Copy function doesn't work great with IDs. The photos usually end up with high contrast and black out at times. One workaround is to scan and then print.
Overall, the printer is good if using primarily to print/scan documents.",3
"This is my first Brother made printer, found complete satisfaction, print quality is clean, sharp. Design is so nice. So many features available. I like duplex printing feature. software is also easy and user friendly. Scanning is just perfect. Speed of scanner and printer is fast as they mentioned. overall good deal.",5
"worthless printer and seller distributed wrong information on amazon portal about wireless connection and product other features related.
Please amazon check all details regarding products .
i am not happy purchase this printer its just like a black marketing",1
I had this printer when I was in Canada. Hence I bought it here too. Amazing print quality as expected. Scanning and software installation is much easier. I have hp mx1130 laser jet. Compared to hp this is way better.,5
Very good product and fast delivery by Amazon and very good paking . product is too good than comparison. And lot's of options available in brother printer...thank you Amazon and thank you brother,5
"Excellent printer. Does the job. Consistent print quality and fairly easy to use. The parts feel made with fragile plastic but for the price I dont think I should complain.

The only problem is the LCD display. It’s very hard to read the display and this is a real shame as this is the only “user interface” and I believe Brother should introduce a backlit display or something similar.

The other disadvantage is that the software that comes with this printer (also available for download from the internet), is heavy and tends to make your computer very slow.",4
"If you require an easy to use, office like print operation and quality at affordable price, look no further, this is the printer for you. The installation was hasslefree, you can download drivers from the link provided in the manual and within 30 minutes the printer is installed. The cartridge drum has a orange locator and the manual has markings and depictions to help you place the toner cartridge in the cartridge drum. The entire process of setting up the printer was a smooth experience. Press the start button, press the print on the PC and the printer starts in a jiffy, the speed of printing is lightning fast and the two sided print happens automatically and seamlessly. Overall, the print quality and the print operation and installation is superb and plug and play. Have to test the scanner though. This is a very capable printer for a home office and can print in bulk and fast. Go for it.",5
"Setup is a breeze thanks to the included CD. If a CD/DVD drive is not available, then the drivers have to be downloaded from the Brother Support Website. The size is around 200MB.

TIP: When choosing the printer model to download the drivers from their website, choose Asian Region and then select Indian Specific Models and you will find the drivers there.",5
"Overall a good printer. I had some initial set up issues. Could not control the contrast and the darkness of the prints. Learning the ID printing and dual page printing techniques were a bit involved. It took a few attempts to get them right.

These features were very useful and most used. I am quite satisfied with this printer now. I do not know the support available for this printer in India, but let us hope that I do not need one. :-)",5
Excellent printer for both home and office use. Crystal clear prints till now.very good printing speed.Overall highly recommended.,5
"So advantages are already mentioned so I am talking about it. What I observe is it requires a amt of space and also draws a large amt of current.. Another thing is that if using an extension box, even if the switch is off,due to large drawing of current you can get small shock if the laptop material is metal... These are not the disadvantages but something you need to care about.

The print quality is awesome and don't forget to register the product in brother site to check it's authenticity.",4
"Pros:

Easy very good Black Prints and fast prints , dual side always a plus. ( Brother quality print are always good)
Easy installation!

Cons are no WIFI (Big-ve for today) , no Ethernet

Still you can make wifi prints via shared router, youtube if you want.",3
"I am fan of brother products since last 12 year first i bought only laser jet with tonner it printed 2600 copy in single tonner , in monsoon this printer dont spread ink like other printers do , never heat and auto updated driver",5
"It's the most amazing printer at this price, I've been using laser printers since 94, the beg. Era of printers, but brother has simply outclassed HP etc, just don't, think twice , if u wanna have monochrome printing needs.",5
Price print quality it's ok but display have not visible no back light .direct print fast .but using from computer its take first scanning then Printing take too much time.for 10 print its take 8 minutes . I am not satisfied with this I am RETURN I am buy little more price around 20000 .,4
"It's a mind blowing fantastic printer for office and business use, print quality is excellent, and duplex printing add extra advantage to this printer, double side printing is awesome, everything is good
Con--- it needs good maintaince, so use properly, don't play game with it, I mean don't take it lightly,
It's not working in inverter, if you still use using high power inverter then may be internal parts damages",5
"Brother printer is good,",5
"1. ABNORMAL MACHINE RUNNING NOISE WHILE COPYING / PRINTING DOCUMENT
2. CD RECEIVED WITH PRODUCT IS NOT WORKING, DRIVERS DOWNLOADED FROM NET.
3. LCD - DIM SO NOT READABLE EASILY

"This is my first Brother made printer, found complete satisfaction, print quality is clean, sharp. Design is so nice. So many features available. I like duplex printing feature. software is also easy and user friendly. Scanning is just perfect. Speed of scanner and printer is fast as they mentioned. overall good deal.",5
Got this for home use. It does exactly as it says and the printer is rather fast than the printers I have used before. The duplex printing facility is also very helpful.,5
"If I have to rate this product across all catagories on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it 9 out of 10. Delivery was well in time as it appeared at the time of ordering it. Quality of the printer and print is great in its class. It is indeed a product with good value for money. I am completely satisfied with this laser printer so far.",5
Better write the try HP laser printer with auto duplex or cannon. I have proof don't neglect this review. It won't print 2000 copies,2
It's display is so poor... We can't see things in its display properly. They also didn't provide return or replacement. software installation is also a difficult task as the cd along with it won't run.We have to go to the website and download it.Overall Printing quality is good.,2
"It has been mentioned on the printer itself that 2600 pages minimum it would print, however, it was able to print only 2000 pages. i am suprised on seeing the differences.",1
Since last 5 years am using Brother Printers .i am telling simply its Pretty hardworker.... But its very impossible to get Customer care support .. I tried and installed myself ....,4

"Past 1 month I used Brother DCP L2520D ..
It's working superb
Speed of Print and Copy is Super ...
If select low resolution scan speed OK.
Totally Awesome product ..
Thanks to Amazon ..",5
product is original except for the toner cartridge. That is duplicate according to the BROTHER engineer who came to set up the machine. machine is works well. But when toner runs out I will have to invest in an original cartridge as this can be filled only max one more time according to the engineer....3500/- for cartridge! The reason why this product is cheaper is because the seller is not giving you the original cartridge and toner. I kept it as it would have been really troublesome to send it back to ludhiana by post from south india. Repackingetc.,2
Call me,1
Good job,5
"I bought this printer from a local store. It works with my mac book pro OS 10.10.5 Yosemite very well. I haven’t ever seen a printer which has such a nice software, which is this smooth and easy to use ever before. The support page on the Brother website is ver instructive and easy to navigate that one can throw away all the manuals and cds coming with the printer as you easy get the installation instructions and software right from the internet. The top cover on the scanner can be lifted, which makes it easy for scanning and copying from text books. Together with hassle free two side printing, this printer/scanner is a real boon for everyone in academics. I have taken printouts and copies about a 100 pages.. I haven’t noticed any Paper jam even though the paper used was not the high quality one. I don’t know how it works with windows, I haven’t tested that yet.. Should be nice I hope..",5
"Best amongst competition. Compare key specs n buy. Printspeed, inbox toner, automatic duplex printing. These r few key features that wil suggest u to buy this one. Finally the price...so this one is the cheapest.",5
"more than two months from buing it works nicely, printing quality is good. what i tried to enclose within my budget price its very good printer comes with multitasking print, scan, copy....",5
This machine is good and nice to use,5
Auto duplex Function is very good,5

"The market price is 28000 to maximum 32000 Rs (depends on location ), I am using one and I am from a very small town.The print quality is good. But the original cartridge (ink) cost around 2400-2600 Rs. This machine has sensor chip, which identifies refill or duplicate ink, so it can't be refilled. and customer has to end up buying a new cartridge. Some people suggests refill ink, but it will not work permanently, after 100-200 prints it will pop up a message saying unknown toner, or duplicate ink. Hence has to be replaced with a original cartridge, than print couple of copies, take out the original cartridge, re insert the refilled one continue for next 100-200 copies. This process has to repeated again & again to use a refilled cartridge or toner. But if you buy in 2800-3200, than its a good one.",3

"I was looking for scanner and printer for home usage (for occasional printing). I decided the hp 2131 which was coasting around 3100 but shortly it became out of stock. So I went for this one and it costed me 3300 on freedom sale.

Prints are clear and also the scanning quality is good I scanned my brother's college id card it was clear . Speed is also good and it is quite light

I will post full review after more testing.",4

"HP Printer is very good, no doubt and a buy at the price. The only problem is the ""loss-leader pricing"" of the replacement cartridges which become uneconomical in the long run...",3
"I won't recommend this. Hardly it worked, it's not at all taking papers for print. Waste of money.",1
"Nice product. As usual printing cost will be high, though i bought it for scanning purpose. Okay for a4 size paper scanning but can't handle a3 or larger. At 300 dpi b/w scanning takes approx 10 second.",5
"Printer catridge 805 not available anywhere including hp store, without catridge the printer is idle no use.please don't cheat people like this.If the product has no support from its manufacturer please don't list it.",1
"Waste of money. Because I had printed around 75 pages with black and white,by that time ink is totally completed. And i didn't find 805 ink cartridges anywhere. Till now .......",1
"HP All-In-One Printer price is very attractive but running cost of ink cartridges is very high.
Scanning is good quality but can scan only one page at a time & you need a separate file binder software to merge all files in single document.

Now coming to cost- (discounts can be available occasionally)
Printer HP 2131 costs close to Rs 2,300 (under discount offers)
It uses HP 803 Ink cartridge.
B/w cartridge costs Rs 702 & colour cartridge costs Rs 836

B/w cartridge can print around 60 pages for Rs 702 & colour cartridge can print max 40 pages for Rs 836
thus cost of single print is Rs 11 Rs/page (B/W) & 21Rs/Page (Clr)

HP's claims for number of pages are under economy mode & under lab test conditions - actual user will get above stated numbers
refill kits are available at half prices of original cartridges but quality of colour prints will be compromised.

Thus recommended to purchase only for occasional users with low usage.
Not cost effective for regular & heavy users.

Please also check my review for HP Deskjet 2135 for cost per print

You can encourage me to write further reviews by hitting YES button :)",3
Printer is good. Scan and print quality also good. But setup takes more time to understand the product and installation. I did myself and it's working fine. Thank you Amazon for the good product.,4
"A very bad product. I can't imagine HP is selling such a part printer wherein the cost of one print out is almost 10 bucks. The ink cartridges are not even able to print 100 pages and cost of cartridge is 1000 bucks so it's cheaper to get print out from the shop then buy this piece of junk.
We even went to the HP store to sort out this but they have no clue. ( Or sometime ignorance is bliss)",1
"Fantastic delivery by Amazon. BUT STRANGE, was not in normal Amazon packaging???
USB cable faulty, careful study shows a duplicate as no ceramic finish, plus pins are not in line.
Installation is done by me using old cable, printer working fine no problems there.
WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE CABLE ONLY? don't want to return whole product waste time, and had disposed of the original packing.
Strongly recomend anyone, not to accept product if not in amazon packing, think this was my problem.however was in hp packing and sealed, but who knows who is responsible? all i need is a cable, price on amazon approx 1500, printer cost approx 3000. ""crazy""",2
"Good decent printer. But difficult to find replacement cartridges. Made huge mistake by buying this printer. If you doubt me, check in Amazon for HP 805 cartridge. Even HP website don't have them. I can't even return the printer. When cartridge dries up, I can't buy original cartridges. May be have the printer as show piece.",2
"Worst printer. Just to check, gave a print for 50 black and white pages. The original cartridge got over. Original 805 model B&W cartridge would cost you around 800/-. Which means one black and white print will cost you 16/-. U can go to a photo shop and get a print on canvas at this price. Worst printer. I regret as there is no return only replacement. Please don't get cheated.",1
"FIrst of all a big thanks to Amazon for quick delivery (within 2 days). Also thanks to the delivery boy for his behavior and politeness. Really impressed.

Now coming to the main topic. I got HP Deskjet 2131 Printer at just ₹2699 during republic day sale.

It is very easy to install the printer alongwith its cartridges. Its looks are superb. Printing quality is also great (I have attached the snapshot of sheet that I printed just!). The scan feature is just rocking because it works very fast. But the printing quality should be improved.

So friends, go for HP Deskjet 2131 printer without any tension.",5
"waste of the money to buy this printer, the link will just dry within 2 weeks if you are not using it, the new cartridge cost is very high , you buy 2 cartridge at the same cost of printer, the cost of printer ink is more then human blood. better use your own blood for printing it will be much cheaper",1
"Per page is too costly approx 16 to 40 Rupees per page do not recommend for home

Its better print the pages from outside market.

Also shared in the Facebook and recommend my friends and colleagues do not purchase this printers .",1
"Defective product, not able to print a single page. Carriage struck in the sides of the printer loudly. Now I have to contact HP service. Very painful process",1
"Got New and good working Product,if you don't want to buy cartridges you can use ink to refill the cartridges,ink can be found in local stores.ink is 50% cheaper than cartridges and there is a lot of link in the bottles",5
"Don't ever buy this printer...instead go for ink tank ones...although this one is cheaper the ink cartridges will cost you the same amount in which u can buy a new printer again... not worthy from such a big brand HP...they made the printer price less but kept cartridge price the highest among all of its range...simply fooling customers..
even cannot use any other cartridge and refilling was also complex.. sometimes works sometimes not :(",1
"Cartridge is very expensive....not recommended to buy this product .Not Cost effective at all ,Priniting from local shop will be cheaper than printing at home",1
"All in One printer which will scan,print and copy(Xerox) 👌👌😀
I have done 100 printouts in 1 day, still ink level showing full.
Photos are printing very nice.

"I got a second hand product the product was opened and on side the barcodes were torn and then everything was just rapped with a tape

I always thought when I read review that ""it would not happen to me I will get a good product""

but here we are

Also the main box was opened and over it there was a plastic tape put to show as if it was original seal u can make out with just the packing

The product looked as of the person has been using it and he soled it

Plz think about this when u buy this product",1
"Build quality is great, the design and colour looks great, printing cost is little high as it Is an inkjet printer so if you need a printer like for occasional use like in project time then you should go for it, else go for laser If only blank and white print is needed, else inktank, also keep a track of this printers price, as it keeps going up and down when i ordered it costed me around 3.9k but somedays later it was 3.7k so keep checking if you can wait for like 1 week or more then order from the official hp site, there you'll get it for more reasonable price, also the no external packaging was done or given in this printer which is bad, what if it got damaged during shipping, it would result in the seller losing money and also I'll end up losing my time and maybe money if i found the damage later on like internal or if i don't have a recording of me unboxing it and found it damaged, something like that.",4
Nice product but printing price is very high. Don't buy this product because its ink cost is very high . But in home use it's OK. So one star missing,4
I luv this i really luv the colour print its exactly the same we are about to wonder.... But im very sad when i come to know that the price of ink catridge is too high. Only we can take 100 copies using one catridge its price is nearly 1000rs. Im disappointed,5
Very poor product replacement needed immediately..no parts available & it’s a very of so let product,1
"Printer is good. Printing quality is remarkable. Cons- Ink exhausted very fastly.
If you can arrange ink from any shop or online, compromising a slightly degraded quality, its printing would be much cheaper. But if you are bound to buy cartridge every time ink is low, it would definitely become an expensive deal on long run.",5
"Bought this printer on 19.08.20.After printing perfectly almost 10/12 pages , it is not working. Customer care suggests to visit a nearby service centre. If this is the after sales service, then I would definitely never ever opt to buy an headache with a handful of money.",1
"I sincerely regret purchasing this product. .there is a major flaw in design it self. Only from one side paper support is there in the tray. So there is no proper ""driven in "" for paper into the printer. It is drawn into the printer from unsupported side it goes on an angle. So print comes as spoiled. I talk to Amazon person they told only replacement is there for this printer ,no money back(may be because HP aware about the flaw in design) , they connect to HP support they told they will arrange a technician that day itself, but no one come for service until now(3 days). I don't know why a reputed company like HP is selling these type of products of no use & keeping their after sales support very bad. When you purchase a printer from HP ,please think twice",1
Printer cost is low but ink cartridge cost is too high.,3
"Changing my review from good to bad. Because in just 7 months the printer started showing problems . Claiming warranty takes forever which FYI means a customer support executive to just hear your complain with nothing done in real.. The ink leaks . Printer throws out blank papers even after and keeps on automatically restarting. It doesn't even recognize new cartridge. Pathetic printer. DO NOT BUY IT IF ITS FOR DAILY USE. BECAUSE ONCE IT STOPS WORKING IT IS GOING TO SPOIL YOUR DAY, EVERYDAY",1
"Nice printer
Scanning quality is very good
Color printing is very good",5
"I BOUGHT IT RS 2900/- ONLY ....
THIS IS VALUE FOR MONEY ...

"This product is a scam because it’s ink consumption is very high and demands constant change in cartridge and this results in excess expense. I have used this printer for hardly 2 weeks and I have changed the ink cartridge twice already (max 20-25 pages printed)

Please don’t get tempered towards the product because of its brand and cheaper price. I hope my reviews helps both the seller and the buyer in their respective ways!!

P.S - I look for the seller to contact me and compensate for this fault product.",1
There is No ink available for the product i have been sitting without ink from past 1 week wat is the use of buying such product,1
The scanning resolution is perfect and printing output is also good. The only problem lies with paper input tray. while pulling the paper inside sometimes the paper gets jammed.,4
"I got this one primarily for scanning the old photos and save them in PC. It does it's job. Nothing to complain about scanner. About the printing, good for few prints but really this is not a heavy duty printer. For serious printing and printing too many papers, go for some higher version or a laser jet. This printer is just for scanning and printing few papers and not for heavy use.
Print quality: good but not for heavy use
Scan: Good and it does it's job.
Durability: not that good for heavy printing, good for scanning. Body of the maching is not that heavy and not that sturdy.
Installing: very easy to install, nothing special engineering really needed.",3
"Good printer for home use.
1. Very easy to install and use. Installation directions comes with product.
2. This printer has no WiFi functionality. Hence, needs to be connected with laptop/desktop with a cable while printing.
3. Print speed is ok, not great (very fast)
4. Double side printing is not automatic. Need to manually feed the pages back to printer if we need printing on both sides of the page.
4. Copy (Photostat) functionality is good. Can copy both in color and black&white.
5. Scan functionality is also good. Once the necessary drivers are installed as part of the installation and printer is added to laptop/desktop, one will understand how to use the scan functionality.",5
"I purchased this product in 2017 during Amazon sale. This printer is very easy to use and very friendly but cartridge is the biggest issue. With the company provided catrdige, you would be able to hardly print 15 to 20 sheets. If you do not use the printer even for 2-3 days, the ink will dry and you will have to replace the cartridge.

Each catridge would cost approx 1000 and you would be able to print max 90 pages and each page print would approximately cost you 11 Rupees, which is very bad.

I sold this in OLX for 1.5k and brought a ink based printer from Epson for 6.5K. This printer prints 6000 sheets for a catridge worth 500. The cost of each color print would be approximately 18 Paise.

Think well before you buy this printer.",1
The printer called is very best than compared to 10000 worth of rupees printer and I am using the printer for my life time user can have that why because the printing called is superior than Canon laser are made any Epson printer I am using the cartridge buy refilling the ink by injecting so the print rate for each black and white pages but at least 10 piece just timepass only and the colour print called as a 25 may be when you are using refilling the cartridge through injection so I already purchased some of ink refilling in c m y k from your Amazon website they also good everything is good regarding this product I give five out of 5 marks,5
"Pros
-Print quality is really great.
-Print speed is fast compared to its previous models.
-Installation is very easy.
-Works with OTG cable in Android
-Lightweight
-Good Build quality

Cons
-Works with OTG cable in Android (However you cannot adjust the print size or quality. It just prints a single image on full size page)
-The software immediately displays the ink levels as half empty even if you just printed a single page.
-Ink is too damn costly.

If you have an occasional use of coloured printing, go for it. It's the best in price range. But for regular use it'll put a whole in your pocket.",5
Nice,3
"Finally after spending two days on it, I was able to install the drivers on mac
1. Download Hp easy start
2. Click contw, it will connect to hp.com and ask to download Hp smart software(This software doesent detect the printer)
3. Click cross button (the one to close the app)
4.You will get three options. Click skip to software download
5.It will start searching for software, if it doesent detect printer, hold power off button of printer for few seconds and click restart
6. Now you will be able to install the drivers.",5
"Not that much of good quality printer it is, I have order two printers instead of one, unfortunately it was happened by amazon's recommendation options for sure. The tech team and the seller should take care of this feature when its availing to any of customer its getting automatically adding two quantity in the cart section, I was usually do double check but I missed to confirming this time. My bad! Amazon tech team is also not ready to help me out. They saying that as per our policy is not allowing us! I'll tell one thing Amazon team! ""Policies are only made for product not for humans' tech activity mistake!""",2
"It is a good printer.. I would say the best

But its only good if you print for like 15-20 pages a month .. (mostly for home use)

I ordered this for my study room..

So I print for like 15 pages a month ..

If u r using it at home or will consume it less then this is the right product..

If u are looking for an office use or you will use it everyday then this product is not for you...
I would recommend you to go for other options

But for few prints (home use) its the best product

Easy to use / install / clean etc..

I loved it .. it worked for me

Lookwise 👍

1)First of all the outer box is not completely sealed..
2)printer is not a brand new one,its a product returned by someone..we can clearly see the invoice of others..
3)both the ink catridges are missing from this peice.
How can someone dispatch an used item and more over without even seeing wether box has all the products.
Terrific customer experience.",1
"Amazing product
Loving it
And very much useful for home use.
Printing and scanning quality is very good
You can see the quantity of print in the photo which I have uploaded showing usage of printer(the spots in the page are due to spill of water it's not printing mistake)

This is worth to buy it😀😀😀",5
"I have used HP printer in past but that was long time ago and now this is my 2nd HP printer. Overall the product is good at this price tag, but I am sure some improvements can be done to enhance user experience. Fit and finish of product is good and is light weight.
1) Installation software needs to be downloaded from HP website and installation is smooth. Software is not very user friendly though
2) I faced issue with my 1st print as after installation of software it was just not printing. But later is started printing after a reboot and about 15 mins
3) Print quality is ok and bit slow, as we expect from a Deskjet printer. (Please don't compare print quality with Laser printer)
4) Scanning is good, scans perfectly but its slow (specially with high DPI). I faced one issue with the software wrt scanning. I can save a PDF with multiple pages in 200 DPI but it does not work with 600 DPI. Maybe HP can provide a resolution or improve the software
5) Last but not the least, Ink cartridges. I am sure these small cartridges with the printer won't even last 100 pages. Most of my printing is black, but even a black one will not last 100 pages. So buying new cartridges at 600-800 per piece is a rip off. Better deal with refilling to have economical printing

Overall its a good product.",4
"Great product at a very attractive price. Good for basic home use. Easy to install.! Colour prints are also nice quality.
Scan is easy and not noisy .",5
"It's been about a month that I'm using the printer and have printed about 140 pages. My reviews are based on the usage in this short period. Hope this helps.

Use: Printer is good for normal home use.

Pages/cartridge: With the cartridges supplied, one can print just about 40 pages (not 100 as mentioned/advertised).

Cost of printing: If cartridges are replaced each time, the cost of printing is too high (something like 19/- per page for b/w). Simply refilling the ink is far economical.

Printing quality: On printing quality, it's better than average. As mentioned, good for home use. Print in draft mode. For pages <= 70 GSM, printing back-back is not advisable. It's traces are visible on the rear page as well.

Printing speed: It prints slightly slow, this being an ink-jet. That's fine and expected.

Features: Prints, Scans and Copies. This is kind-of basic model, so no features such as automatic double-side printing. That's known and is fine. It goes well when more than one page is placed in the feeder. With a single page, it needs to be inserted in the slot till the end below, which isn't easy...and the page usually get's stuck while printing. It's advised in the manual to use multiple pages in the feeder (manual is not a part of the product...to be searched/downloaded online).

Handle with care: Parts are delicate, need to handle with care (especially while removing cartridges to refill).

Overall: At this price, it's good to have.",4
"After 3 days of purchasing the color printing not working properly and only the pink color is print on paper.

For solving this issues i called to HP customer support but i only roam on the website and shows number is invalid

Still if the company read my review kindly contact me.",1
"Giving review after 3 months view..

Never ever in ur life ,even if by mistake dont think about buying this inkjet or deskjet type printers of Hp.Hp is chinese.and we know china and chinamall.
I dont know about ink tank printers but yes this type of inkjet is a total waste of ur money and time.

My hp 2131 printer lasted around 3 months only with so many messy things ,
Printed 40 pictures with the demo catridges.
Next 300 pages with refilled ink of good quality.
Now both of color and black catrige doesnt recognizing.

New Catridges cost 1900 around. That is insane amount compared to printer cost.
Hp suggests always replace catridges after single use(40 photo printing-1900rupees).they wont even listen or attempt to repair if there is other faults otherthan catridge unless u buy new catridges of 1900.

Then why the hell will someone buy this costly catridge rather not throwing the machine in first place.we do not have money thats why we came to this cheap price.

You may try inktankbut again that is also fitted with so many chip components and i doubt hp set some type of firmware there too,but laserjet is defimately best option for a cost effective and long run printer.
so at the end i am going with CANON LB2900 as it is long lasting and made from Japan.
Previously i have a canon inkjet ip1300 .that has been working for 10years .trust me.
So Canon is a good choice.hp may have more service centers than canon,but what if u cant get the service out of that.
Nothing is more than costomer satisfaction.

So u may try canon inkjets.but i personally recommend always go for canon specially laser printers.",1
"Using this printer from one month without problem. Quality is good when printed with normal mode. Have not used draft or high quality mode yet.

Printed 12 colour pages and more than 50 black and white till now. Can't comment about the cartridge life.

Color print speed is much slower than black and white print, but it's ok for me because I don't need many colour prints.

Overall a good budget printer.",5
"The printer is working good.
We bought it in diwali offer. For this much lesser price , the printer is working very very nice. The quality is so good. Thanks to Amazon and HP. I bought it for my dad while I use another HP LaserJet p1007 printer. Both the printers r working well.
Initially I had little problem in installing this deskjet printer to iball 8"" tablet PC. The printer model/ type was not showing initially. But the problem is rectified now. Still I have to find the way to ""scan"" the printer in the tablet pc even after installing the HP smart app. I don' have much time.
Still I have yet to try the cloud printing or it would be better if HP helps to make work the scanning function. The other 2 functions (print and copy) r working fine.

Thanking u all,

Regards- Vinodh Kumar & family. (Amazon customer).",5
I purchased this 6 months ago. I purchased it for my personal use at home. But I did a big mistake. The reason not to buy are : -1.paper get stuck: - first few month it was smooth experience but after that whenever I wanted print the paper gets stucked in the middle of the printer. Then I have to manually remove page from printer.2. Unpleasant noise : - printer makes a unpleasant noise while printing. It gives feeling that the printer has been damaged. First time I was scared by this noise.3. Poor quality of print : - the quality of print is not at all good. This is a ink printer.4. Costly cartilage : - they are must expensive black cost 800 and colour cost 1000.then don't work even 1 month properly.Note : - don't buy this printer.you should buy the new generations printer this is very costly and not effective.BELIEVE ME.,2
This is third HP printer that I have purchased. I had HP deskjet 1050. Only Rollers create problems may be due to more wear and tare. But company may take care of quality. Second big hurdle is the refill problem. Cartridge too small and costly and suddenly exhausted. In emergency unavailable immediately. Working hampers as nobody can count pages printed. Otherwise printer is awe sum.,4
"This printer is a very cool deal in this price point. You can print , scan and copy easily. I personally liked this product. It is best suitable for home use. However printing rate is a little slow but it produces high quality prints.
Based on my observations, I can say that -
1) Printing speed - 7/10
2) Print quality - 10/10
3) Command (how fast it catches the commands) - 9.5/10
4) Durability - 9/10
5) Scanning - 10/10
6) Functioning of buttons placed on the printer - 10/10

One more thing that I can see on this printer that it will not catch the paper on the tray if only one is placed. You have to manually press that single paper so only your printer will recognize it.
Otherwise everything is good.",5
"I bought it at very affordable price of 2500₹. It's really easy to install. One can search for installation process on YouTube and then follow the procedure. Print quality is too good. The best feature is that it's 3 in one printer which can print, scan and copy. The thing I didn't liked much about it is cartilage which may dry up so you need to use the printer in every 2-3 days. All the cartilage can finish after printing 100 pages. It's good for those who use it for personal home use.",5
"If you know how to remove a few pieces of sticky tape and follow pictorial illustrations to slot in the ink cartridges, the initial setup is easy. What is not so easy is getting HP's Smart App to work. It's an utterly senseless interface with ambiguous prompts and instructions. Once you have figured out that you don't need to 'add' the already installed printer, then you run into a regularly freezing app. Thank goodness for Ctrl-Alt-Del. HP offers no advice or good solutions for their Smart App's freezing problem. There is a workaround though, which I finally discovered after trying umpteen number of things. Terrible terrible 'Not-Smart' app. Print quality is OK. Scan quality is poor.",3
"Printer is budget product for home use, but original ink is a big scam, 2 Rs. manufacturing cost of product has MRP Rs. 754/-. And local ink refill will not work every time, Sometimes cartridge will failed, some time printer will block the cartridge. and indicator light will blink continuously. Reset and other tricks available in youtube will not work once cartridge blocked.",1
"ABOUT THE PRINTER:-
user-friendly, medium-sized not too big or too small. good for desk and personal use.
2 ink cartridges come with the printer. it's a light lavender coloured printer which I love. there's no printing paper with it.
HOW TO INSTALL:-
so I am writing this because I myself had never used a printer in my life on my own.
1. remove the covers and plastics and the cardboard inside protecting the ink slots. adjust the paper alignment (the paper alignment bar can be moved to adjust) and close the inner door from where the print will come out, only open the outer door.
2. connect the wires to your laptop/desktop and go to the website provided in the pamphlet.
3. follow the instructions from the website and you're done!!

hope it helped :)",5
"Defective product. After installation almost I have wasted my 2 hours with HP team for getting my problem resolution of paper not loading.. and they have assigned an engineer for resolution of the same ...

25-Jan-2021: As per HP care Team product is faulty and needs to be replaced.
27-Jan-2021: Replacement product received. Which is also faulty and now a refund is initiated.

In case you want to waste you 1 week for this long process go ahead and purchase this trouble box.",1
"It is simply impossible to understand as to why HP cannot create a simple installation system. You have to first download an app which then refuses to recognise the printer and keeps asking to ""connect"" the printer when it is already connected! In three days after delivery, I have somehow managed to install the printer on two laptops and still waiting for HP app to work on one more laptop. All in all, utterly third grade product. I had canon printer earlier which was fast easier to install and operate. Not surprisingly, HP has named its printer driver as ""HP Smart"" - it is the dumbest app around",1
"I was using an HP 1515 all-in-one printer for several years but it got stuck with a paper jam problem. It did not have any setup cartridges, but this 2331 printer is having them. Instead of simplifying setup, HP is making it more and more complicated. Since the setup cartridges are to be thrown out after a 5-minute use, they only serve the purpose of eco-unfriendliness. I can manage with this 2331 because I am running a one-man business.",1
"On time delivery by Amazon. Print quality is GOOD, on par with any other printer at this price range. But canon mg2570s & mg2577s are cheaper & comes with cheaper cartridges (something I observed).
It takes some time for the Scanning & printing process but thats normal for home use & even OK for small home business uses. The lid hinge looks & feels quite flimsy though.
Installation process was hassle free. Online Registration was swift. Hp's app is super easy to use just uninstall the bloatware ;)
Refill cartridge is some what expensive but thats inevitable with any inkjet printer (no point in blaming only hp for that) but canon's 745s black & 746s color cartridges are relatively cheaper, (around 200/- less)

Overall Good product, at the price of 3K it gets the job done without any trouble.",4
"Best in this price. Budget friendly.
The print quality is awesome for colour and black and white print both.
We never used printer before but installation was very easy.
Yes, print speed is bit slow but we don't need to open a shop, in 3400 INR it serves more than it needs to be. Scanner is awesome and fast too. I am truly satisfied with the purchase.
It is being used frequently by all of us in our family.",5
Everything works fine and printing quality depends on the ink. The stock cartridge ink works like charm. The color cartride after 3-4 refills stops detecting by the printer even when it's full with ink which I think is a scam of printer business. But the black cartridge still works whenever it got empty I refill it and it's works. The printer works with single cartridge too! But the cartridge are very costly to buy,5
"Printing quality really amazing. Ink consumption is bit more, but it is ignorable. It is not so handy for office heavy duty use. Now in the present situation of Work from home condition it is good fit. Do not take much of space, easy to set up. Ink cartridges are costly. No installation CD or support is supplied with the instrument. One have to download the driver online. That's become a big challenge sometime. Aesthetics and Printing efficiency are good.",5
"It's low cost printer but maintenance (running cost) is too high. Printing cost is approx Rs. 8-10 per page for Black and white and Rs. 10-12 for color printing because cartridge will cost you Rs. 700 (B&W) and 850 for color.
Or, If you are thinking you will refill your cartridge then you can't, because HP Smart app will deduct that cartridge and you can't print with that you have to purchase new cartridge after printing 50-60 Pages.
Hope It will Help you to select right printer for your need.",1
Really i must tell you this junk here is amazing i mean who the hell can give you hd printout at such a low price and it's a complete machine with print scan and copy and really easy to install there are two methods of software installation one is online and second is offline both are easy you should go for this,5
Horrible horrible when it comes to cartridge. Printing is good quality only if you install orginal original cartridge if you try to refill the cartridge with different ink things was really messy each cartridge cost 750 rupees so you can understand how expensive the cartridges are. it gives only max to max 100 page of good printing.,1
"Please read till end , trust me please don't buy this , after one cartridge is empty if 164 prints are done from one cartridge it will show empty cartridge and one cartridge costs 1200 and if you use this printer so rarely the ink will dry up or if you refill an empty cartridge it will not print anything and buying new cartridge everytime it drains up it will cost you 2400 per month , it's better to buy a expensive printer rather than buying a cheap hp one and later knowing we were scamed it and even now you are not convinced than try printing some images of 2K and above it will print them near to 720 p there's no reason to buy this awful thing",1
"I think it's a stupidest buy of my life.

I got this Printer at 2400/- odd, I was very happy but soon I got to know about this fraud.

Printer they are selling at 2400/- and guess what it's cartridge is worth rs. 1500 /-(If you are buying Colour Cartridge as well).

The maximum pages 50 it has given. Till now I have brought 4 cartridges worth rs. more than 4k which more than cost of this printer.

It can only be successfully used as a Scanner.

Be smart and research about what I am saying.

These cartridge wont last even 1 month.",2
"Printer setup and configuration is pretty easy. The cartridge life is really poor. For me it exhausted after printing about 40 to 45 pages. Both the black and the colour cartridges exhausted. Other than that, if the paper gets jammed, you have to be really careful to take it out from the printer because it may damage the interior ribbons. Print quality is really good at this range and photocopy is also good.",4
"Its a hell of a task for this printer getting ready for your use. The drivers installation process is quite cumbersome and ""cherry on top"" the software HP Smart is not detecting the printer. ( Now using other HP software which finally detected the printer.)
Also not much of an assistance is available on internet to help you troubleshoot. You are on your own.",4
"Wanted a colour printer for the longest time without knowing it. I wanted it for printing study materials, and doing some official works like photo copying.

This machine does it all. Im really satisfied. Its like one of the things that makes life easier.

If u r in a dilemma, don't be... U can go for it",4
"If actually U count. It comes to 6-8 Rs/print on one side only.
Plus the cartridge though they say it prints 180 pages/cartridge. Mine works only for 100 max even without pictures/diagrams which might be considered uses more ink.....
Only advantage is i can print whenever i want. Whatever i want. Apart from that, its a waste...... Though product works great.....",1
Within a week it's paper jam issue started. Hp technical person saying nonsense things. It printed only 20 page. N he saying yes sir it's only 20 page giving cartridge is empty. After we bought new cartridge again it strucked now he's saying it's not cover in warranty. I purchased this just 15 days back it completely waste of money and time. Hp is worst support. I do not recommend this product don't buy this brand it's just a brand u can't get any support.,1
"This product does printing and scanning well. Works as expected. Main problem comes is the ink cartridge. If you shop online original cartridge, it costs ₹800 and more ( for small black catridge that yields just ~190 pages ). That's more costly if you are taking more print out or copy. If you take less pages and do scan, then this is good for you.",5
"I would like to say that it was very easy to install the printer and it's easy to use it. However, I would like to mention that the ink is not too much and after 120 pages it's not possible to print out any document with a high quality. Anyway, it's a good product for personal use. If you want to buy something for office, I don't recommend this printer because it's made for personal and domestic use. It's an all-in-one made for home. Good product!",4
"Printer is good, no complaint but cost of printing makes us cry(i put least quality prints). While buying we think we dont take much prints but that opinion does not last long. Go for ink tank even if budget does not permit.",3
"If you are looking for a cheap printer for home use, for school work, hobbies etc, and you print about 50-80 pages per month, this is the best one available in the market for that. All in one printer in less than Rs 3000 is a steal indeed. Very easy to set up, just download the drivers from hp website before hand.
Color print at draft setting comes put with lines , so keep that in mind.",3
"Yet to install.but basic functions are great.3300while ordered and had to pay 3.5k.only wish this lasts for a while, unlike other Chinese products.wanted a sturdier fibre built, seems more of a plastic variety :(",4
"Did not work well, could print only 5 black and white pages and stopped printing after that. Color prints were also not good from day 1 itself. Need to take it to nearest HP shop now to check whats the issue. Updating the review again .... in total in printed 78 pages only, after this HP forcing to buy new cartridge for 800 which will print 100 pages,,, so per page print cost is 8 on top of money paid to buy the printer... third class useless product",1
"Decent print quality. Good option for thr price point compared to other HP printers.
Takes a little extra time to print but is not disappointing.
The software to control the printer is quite a hassle but nothing impossible to get through.

Installation was mostly automatic and a merely 5min procedure.

Happy to have bought this for domestic use.",4
"Don't Buy Only 90 Black&White Pages can print with one cartridge.
I was take wrong decision to select this printer.
When you going to purchase new cartridge it's cost is 700 to 800 rs.
You can't refill cartridge
Don't believe on YouTube video I tried many times but it's not working.
I suggest to HP plz low down cartridge price .
Now one Print cost using with this printer is about 10 to 12 rs for Black & White.
Any one want to buy this printer plz read my review carefully and also watch YouTube review",1
"so I gave all rate 3 stars but I gave
print quality 5 stars
Easy to install 4 stars
Easy to use 5 stars
BUT
the printer costs 3,299
with cartage
and after like 20-25 prints the black&white cartage is over & now throw that cartage in the garbage and but a new 800 rupees cartage.
same with the colour cartage but the change is colour cartage costs 1200 rupees",3
"Hp ink catridges are 750rs for black and 999 for tricolor, black ink gives merely 150 pages then u have to buy a new one,if anyhow u try to refill it ,catridge gets distorted then never be of use again and if refilled properly print quality is always smudgy and sometimes unreadable",1
"Never buy cheap printers. This is totally a scan big printer giants sell printers for small amount of money. Because their main agenda is to sell ink cartridges and that where they earn money from.

This is the cheapest junk you can buy. It stopped working after 6 months and got repaired in warranty, then again it stopped working after 13 months and now HP is asking 5000 rupees to repair it. Plus it is a ink guzzler printer one cartridge barely prints 70 black page. And 30-40 coloured prints max out.",1
Good product bit model is obselete in the market is what I came to know. Very easy to install & it’s plug and play type. There is no CD along with for installation & ths drivers could be downloaded online. Depends on the system config is takkrion process becomes easy. For windows 10 it takes few minutes but other system it might take a few minutes. But print & product quality is excellent & worth buy for a house. Reccomend this product for sure.,4
"The printer is not useful unless you going to print 5 or 10 pages a month
Pros-
Print quality is good
Easy to install
Cons-
The ink is very expensive , the first time we have printer around 30 or 40 pages then we had to buy a black ink catridge which is around 750
When printing in bulk it does not print the pages correctly, eg if I give page 15 to 20, it prints some random pages like13, 17 and all
Paper feeding mechanism is not that good, you may have to keep adjusting it",2
"What's good about the all-in-one?
• It costs only ₹3000.
• The scanner is so silent I feared it wasn't working at all.
• The prints come out good.

What's bad?
• For a ₹3000 printer, the cartridges cost around ₹2000. Just increase the cartridge cost to ₹3000 and I can buy printers instead and sell the old one for cashback.
• The provided cartridges barely have any ink. Few prints and they're out.",4
"The ink hardly lasts 30 pages , specially the back cartridge.
Combined Ink refill cost is more than printer and they are hardly available.
Initially thought this is worst HP product ever in terms for value for money then concluded all printer companies are scam.",1
This is epic printer i suggest or say order everyone to use this printer it has very good printing quality as i have showed it in the picture it is also easy to install and main thing it is very cheap price with exclusive properties i copied one bookmark and it is absolutely awesome as i have shared it in the picture the right one is real and the left one is copied which actually look same i suggest everyone must buy this...,5
This is a one of great scam....the printer is less expensive ....but the cartridge are tooooo expensive....and slowly you get habitual with print....and you want more and more categories....and now the cartridge are not available in the market....owned and controlled by company,1
"The print quality is okay but the real problem lies in the catridge after 30 prints it showed low ink when we try to take the diagnostic pages it gives clear print but then u can't give a print frm ur pc and u can't take a copy as well regret the purchase, so I am updating after use and I replaced the catridges and the printer is still not working go for other companies the repair guy also hasn't arrived even after complaining to the company",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Not worth it I paid more than 3000/- for it installation was not easy for a begginer or first timer. Print quality not that good average. Print cost is very high as just by printing 8 colour print catrage is empty. Pathetic will for sure return.",1
"Very delicate. Parts break easily. The inkjet provided says 120 papers of printing, it finishes in 40-45 paper.
Avoid.",2
It seems the black ink cartridge was already dried up .Few prints were taken and the impressions were very light and then it stopped altogether.Now I am getting my print work done from market.The colour cartridge dose not print black & white work at all.There is some problem. I did have two copies printed of my vaccination certificate with colour where in PM’s photo was in colour.No technical staff ever responded my call. The printer is lying like a monument.If approved I would like to return it and buy some other model or else cartridges be replaced and also technical assistance provided to ascertain serviceability of the printer.,2
"The product I received that is the printer, was not sealed (I am saying that the printer is not sealed not the packaging ), the thermocol packaging inside the box is broken into pieces, there were no ink cartages, there is no manual or any quick start guide, there was no software cd or DVD, the printer is not taped also. It was definitely either a defective or a used product. The seller should make sure about the quality of the product. I have purchased a lot of products from amazon and this happened to me for the first time. It is really disappointing and it will create a bad impression on the seller.",1
"I have always used HP product and have been satisfied with the service as well as the products. The printer is not printing only after 40 days of purchase. Paper is getting jammed and nothing is printing. tried the basic self help from HP website. Still the paper is getting jammed. I need to contact HP for service and support, I do not have much time for the run around with the service center, tried calling the service center they are not picking the call. I don't know if I am calling the right number. The rating is purely for the product.",1
"If u have enough money and no mens to use that money then buy it, and waste all ur money by spending on the costly ink-catridge. If you try to refill it with other ink ur catridge will get damage someday. So my suggestion is not to buy it. I should research on it before buying it. Anyway it's now a decorating item in my room since I can't afford that costly ink-catridge.",3
"Print quality 8/10
Installation 10/10
Using 10/10

Now I found the reason why hp is buying this good printer for low price, if you want to print pictures this is just a scam. If you want to print a pictures it prints just 4-5 page & cost of cartridge is 1200 so cost per page is 300 rupees, when I bought this printer & printed 4 pictures on A4 size pages and my ink got over I thought you I don't used cartridge and I ordered for new one & after installing new one I printed again A4 size picture & checked cartridge it because half.
HP don't even allow us to refill if we refill our cartridge then our printer will not have warranty so if you are only black and white printer then buy then one but for colour printing don't buy this better go to cyber cafe and print what you want or buy laser printer never ever buy inkjet printers for colour printing.",2
"Things I want you to know:
1.It is not cost effective for long term.

Reason: The cartridges which they give (1 Black and white, 1 Tri-Colour) are not at all sufficient. At max, you will get 50 best quality printouts or 70 Draft/Normal printouts .

2. You need to buy extra cartridges which will print around 190 pages and will cost Rs.755/- per cartridge. Just keep this point in your mind.
3. In my case, the same day, the printer arrived, after printing 5 pages, all the lights started blinking and I had to lock a complaint call to HP. The technician came after 2 days , applied white grease , dealt with the cartridge placements and repaired the (new) printer!
4. You must take the extended warranty for at least 2years, coz you shouldnt rely solely on the guaranteed product.
5. The print quality will vary according to cartridges. But I must say, go for the wifi enabled printers [which it isnt].",2
I bought this product from amazon. after install I found out that its driver is not available on HP site. I tried to refund but amazon customer agent didnt allow and pushed me to install HP Smart and told that it will work with that. BUt it didnt work. Now amazon is saying that refund window is closed and I can not return this useless product. I dont know where to reach it to refund or get it working....,1
"First of all, if you're a student who wants a printer for printing study materials, for e.g. notes and assignments, then surely go for it..It also comes with inbuilt scanner, so you can download and print registeration or entrance forms, and easily upload with the scanning option..
Yeah, the cartridge proves to be very uneconomical; So better if you refill the catridge at the right time( when the ink level is low but not dried up )... I suggest you to get a prodot ink bottle and you can easily fill upto 20 times..

Tried reaching the customer care but no luck with that either. At last had no option and started using this. Amazon should be more strict with packing and delivery of such electronic products.",4
Product is nice one no doubt about it and very easy easy to use. Print out a bit costly as per print cartridge cost. But one we are using for home use and every now and then print out is not required so it worthy in this view. Print and copy quality is beautiful only thing you have to use original everything...hope you understood. Rest all ok. Very easy to install.,4
"since I bought this product printer not working, we hardly printing 5-10 pages ina day, since day one which is not working, we using our next-door printer ( we thought its some drive issue - yesterday I have so IT person came and look into this, he said this mechanic is gone not able to fix ........ what is the guarantee of this product we simply purchase from amazon --I don't know whether your people checking this product is working are not ???---- I am not happy at all i need refund and take back this -even if there is no money return also take this and throw this crap to his face........... i dont wank keep this e waste with me ....",1
"It's definitely worth buying this printer especially if your needs are relatively simple. This printer is essentially a simple all in one printer with copy, print, scan features. The printer comes with HP Inkjet cartridges. You have to feed paper from its back. It's very easy to use once you've done the setup right.
There's one pain point though i.e. the printer does not come with any software disk. I had to search online and download the right printer driver for my PC to make it work.",4
"I now understand why it’s priced so low. The description sells you quality but starting from installation, the paper tray and it’s alignment to the quality of print - it’s as cheap as the price. I would recommend future buyers, to at least see the quality of print, before you buy this product. After comparing the print from a cannon printer, I feel a bit short changed.",1
"Have been using the printer for about a month. It's very good for home use. I'm sticking to original ink cartridges for the time being as the refill procedure provided in the after-market cartridge and ink seemed too cheap and prone to spillage. Even otherwise, original cartridges are easy to use and affordable for home use, when you consider the trouble of going to a shop to get printouts and the cost you pay there.",5
"Printer is ok for those who are economically well to face heavy maintenance cost. I could print only 80 pages (b/w) with the provided cartridge. I realised that it is not meant for me, so i returned it immediately.

Pros
1. Comparatively cheap cost printer with AIO features
2. Good printing speed with medium quality for home purpose
3. Quality scanning and functioning

Cons
1. Heavy maintenance cost (especially for cartridges, you have to pay about Rs. 769/- per cartridge)
2. Colour fades after few days
3. Colour print is not up to the mark
4. Ink refilling is an option but risky (lasts maximum 3 times per cartridge)

Suggestion
1. Better go for ink tank printers, even though initial cost is more - profitable in long run (if you print atleast 300 pages per month, then compulsorily go for ink tank)
2. Take care in case you plan to refill the ink, it may damage your printer as well as void your warranty",3
"Print quality is good. The ink that comes with the printer is demo one, good for around 25 bw and around12 color pages. After that, the new ink cartridges are costly. Almost 12 rupees per bw and 20 rupees per color sheet. If you use it frequently to do not go for this.",3
"Please don't buy this printer seeing the cost. The cartridges finished super fast and absolutely does not work if you try to refill it back. The cartridge is of course qay expensive. We already had a hp printer but after a while you obviously don't get the cartridge (ploy to sell new models understood). Got this one for OCCASIONAL printing, but now having a bad headache coz of it. Less than a star.",1
Usng it is very costly the cartrigde ends very soon and then when you want to buy a new one it's about half the price of printer.! cartridge prints not more than 40 pages My printer After the 2 cartridges which were included with it got over i could not dare to buy new one because of its price and so i threw my printer,1

disappointed, AVOID !",1

A few cons.
1. The stock carterage is terrible it's a very poor quality.
2. Carterages are not reusable
3. I received a damaged carterage.
4. Cost cutting is highly observed over the printer.
5. Also no proper information on how to use the printer via laptop",5

Easy to install and setup.

Excellent product and worth the buy. Was at a good discount and certainly won't get the price anywhere in market. Also this printer was even available second-hand on Amazon for INR 700 cheaper but saw how disturbed customer's were after receiving it. Totally worth not being stingy and buying this new.

"PROS
1.Easy installation
2. No smudging
3. Speed around 8-10 page/ min (black and white)
4. Color Printing also nice
CONS
1. Printer sound
2. Vibration
3. Cost of Printing a little high
4. No double side Printing

Go for it if you are to print 50-100 page per month. Use Draft mode(b&w) for less ink consumption.",5

Fragile to handle.The back-end support is not stable.It takes the precision of a surgeon to main the paper in the exact position so as to be picked up my the roller to print. Print speed is too slow. If you want to print 50 pages or so , dedicate half day of yours for that. Waste of time and money. Returning it in the first 3 hours.",1
Not even got 40 copies with given black cartridge. Problem within 4 weeks of purchase. When we called costumer service they have raised a complaint and given phone number with address of the service centre. Stupid service and they didn't even picking the call that to for a week time. Such irresponsible person and service,1
The ink tank printer is easy to handle. And pretty much good quality of print. Issue is only when you realise once ink got finished filling with suitable similar ink that's a head ache.Because the ink cartridge is too expensive than the real printer itself.,4

"I dont know why people are writing negative reviews about this product. This is purely for occasional use at home. The print quality is amazing (both b/w and colour), easy to set up and use. You just need to download the driver and all set for use. I will recommend this product for home and occasional office usage. Best product in this price range.",5
"Product seems average. Was given a product by the seller where the seal was broken , installation CD was missing. I tried to place a replacement request but instead I am asked to contact HP for missing accessories. Isn't it the basic requirement to provide an untampered product by the seller ?",1
"Print quality not good, I think item was opened or used somewhere. And ink cartridge already installed. Ink cartridge also damaged and it will seen as used. Overall I think it will be used used product. I want to answer from amazon about this product.",1
"I got this all in one printer during the lockdown period for my WFH requirements. Happy to report the printer is super easy to install and use. Print and scan quality could be better but considering the price, it is adequate. Amazon delivery is as usual prompt and very reliable.",5
"Baddest printer ever
I buy hp deskjet 2131 in just 3099rs
This printer is one of the bad printer not because of quality but also the number of print it can prints in one Cartage.
This printer can print on 20 instead of 120 that is really breaking the trust of customers and at the time of replacing they firstly offer replacement and after that they cancel it
I am feel very unhappy to buy this because of quality and the service of Amazon
Very very very bad service amazon
Please improve your services before delivering products.",1
I was bale to take only one clor phpto print on a phot paper .After printing a single photo the Color Ink indicator is blinking was therafter not able to take a single print. To take black print out now I have to take the color catridge out and then take Black print out . Unable to take Color printouts thereafter. God know whether the original catridge got damahed or the Printers Color printing assembly. Awful product experience.,2
Bought hp deskjet printer a month back. Recently i am unable to take black and white print. Contacted hp service online & then informed my print problem to HP service executive. In turn they advised me to contact local service centre of hp for replacement. Surprisingly HP service centre denied any replacement of cartridge as it’s setup cartridge. HP seller has not informed that printer will be delivered with setup cartridge (limited print capability) and we have to by normal cartridge additionally. It’s unethical & not expected from hp,1
"Amazon No complaints with the H.P. Desk jet 2131 printer. It has scanner & copier also.
3 in 1. That is print, scan & copy. Working smoothly no complaints.
It's a value for money. Only the printer driver has to be downloaded from the Internet. N. Srinivasan",4
"After 3 months of usage , an writing this review , sometime the pages we print are not printed in correct manner on A4 papper , sometimes the alignment is not correct while printed in A4 , and some time a small portion is sliced off at bottom or edges while printing. Scanning is fine, Overall an average printer, okay with it but not the best one in my opinion , for the price which i bought it is doing my needs and iam okay with it.",3
The product is great. Produces nice and crisp prints. The only downside is the cost of the cartridges. End of the day you will be spending more on the cartridges than the printer.,4
"I printed only one paper the first time I used. the second time, I got toner error and had no clue what the issue was..
never used the printer since then
tried to return it, but I had crossed the 10 days mark then. there was no option to even get in touch.",3
Print quality is good but the problem is that a colour cartridge can print only 65-70 pages and black cartridge can print 70-80 pages . After that we need to buy a new hp original ink cartridge which cost about 1400-1600 rupee ..... Its really costly for longterm use..,4
"Horrible printer never buy waste of money
Rs 2000 for small cartridge replacement cost way better to buy a ink tank printer just plain fraud 😡😠😠😠😠😡 actual cost exceed more than 25 rupees per page black 9out of 10 times ink cartridge block rs 2000 for just replacing 2cartridge just to print less than 30 pages if u want a printer get a ink tank of espon never buy this printer again total waste of money",1
As per my opinion the said product is directly imported from China and keep in ware house no PDI/No checking done and also not inserted the user manual in Indian language or English language. and deliver to Indian customers,1
Don't Buy cartridge printers. It will cost you much much higher in long run after 2 to 3 years if you compare between (both cartridge-printer + all the cartridge you have purchased) and (inktank-printer + all ink) you will find out ink tank is much cheaper . Better go for inktank. Never think you can refill and use old cartridge HP blocks old cartridge after it's ink get empty. Printer will not detect refilled cartridge.,1
Print quality is very bad as the black cartriage slot not printing properly and only coluor printing slot work. Installation is very hard as the i was applied engineer for installation after 6 hours long time printer installed and not easy to use as the cartriage daily empty.,1
"Great product at this price range. Best product for home use and easy to use.

Quite easy to install and great product for kid's school projects. I would definitely recommend this product. Go for the product without any second thought. I have been using this for last 3 months with non issues.",5
Print quality is very good but scan quality is not upto the mark... installation is not at all user friendly they need to give driver oftware CD....if you are not computers savy you will then face the heat while installing this printer,3
"This is a simple, old school, wired printer for light, basic use. Haven't had it long, so can't comment on print yield, etc but it is straightforward to set up, *as long as you are using it with Windows devices"". HP customer service is pathetic and humans there are incredibly difficult to access... I will not be buying HP again.",3
"I have received the product and looks nice. I tried to install the device but there are lots of issues. Mainly driver is not getting installed. After that I have contacted customer support team to assist for the installation and it got installed.

Not sure why I am having this issue, If i am trying to print multiple document it is not possible. After the first file got completed need to restart the printer to print the next pages.

Any one know how to fix it?",2
"Looks good , prints well but there is a big problem in the way it pulls in the paper. Mostly paper doesn't get pulled in one go and one has to repeatedly push and keep pressing the feed button. For heavy users, this may get really frustrating and also compromise the life of buttons. Didn't expect such substandard quality from HP.",3
"It is smaller in size than my earlier HP printer. All the 3 functions viz, print, scan and copy are working fine. The only problem I faced so far is that the paper does not go smoothly in its slot. The printing is also slower than expected",4
"The printer is working perfectly fine and the quality of the print is really awesome the only drawback of this printer is the cost of the cartridge. The combo of HP 803 costs around Rs 1500 which is half the price of the printer itself. Moreover, the cartridge does not last long for 100 pages the maximum pages which can be printed with a single cartridge is 20 pages.

I would recommend not to buy this product unless and until you wanna spend your hard-earned money lavishly.",3
"It's actually will be more economic for you to go to your neighborhood photocopy shop than using this printer.
650 rs per cartridge wont even last 100 A4 pages in standard quality.
Inkjets are such a ripoff, man.",2
I printed aound 30 copies and the ink was over. Hp printer app dint work for me to get print outs from my phone. I had to download Nokko printer app on my phone. Not at all satisfied with this product. Please go for a better printer. Don't be decieved by the price. Not worth it.,1
On installation of printer and software. A test page and alignment page printed. Checked estimates ink level in cartridge in the HO software. It showed 2/3rd level in colour and nearly 1/2 level in black. Either cartridges were faulty or with low ink level. Black cartridge printed no more than 50 pages. Most expensive per page printing cost at around Rs 15 per page.,1
Excellent...in low cost...with lots of facilities available...printer..copier....scanner...but limit to A4 size only...which is standard...for scanner or copier. Next refill is easier in inkjet than laser. Overall for personal use its a great device.,4
"Overall Printer is okay for home use.
printer catridge is liitle bit clogged while printing. ink level is very less.
also, no carry/cover pouch is given inside the box for keep safe from dust.",3
"From day1 we had issue with this printer as one of the print cartridge (color) did not work at all. Despite follow up with the manufacturer, even they were not able to fix the issue. Now after using it for a couple of days for just black and white printing, even that print cartridge also stopped working. Overall very bad experience with this printer and service. Not recommended to buy.",1
It's not value for money after you buy as usual any inkjet ...after you use some day after 2 or 3 refilling you get lots of issues al always ...eventually its cheap but maintenance of the printer not so low,3
Good product but only issue is that cartridges are too small and hold very less ink even on refilling. Cost of new cartridge is too high. Economy printer should have reasonably priced cartridges.,3
I received my printer today. The Cartridges package was open. I am not able to take color print. Black Ink Printer was of poor quality. Awaiting response from Amazon or Seller on replacement or refund.,1
"I have purchase this product but the printer has not printed 50 pages , and showing problem with printer. Also my product is under warranty but still I am not getting any support on this item. It is not printing any document. Is it possible to exchange the items ? Worst item received from Amazon . No quality check and after sales services .",1
"I like everything in this printer but the real reason is about disliking this product is not imtge printer but it's cartage system it's very much costly you could even buy a new printer if you wish to buy two three sets of new cartage don't buy this printer if you wish to print economically don't take this printer even you if you want to print 1 or 2 prints because that will even cost you more than 10 or 11 rupees per print so don't buy by another type of printer which do not use cartridge system if you want to print economically

"DO NOT BUY HP PRINTERS.. They do not have driver /Software for Macbook IOS version 10.15.5 .. on several request n calls HP customer care replies with a sorry saying they do not have driver for Mac latest version so i have to wait until they have it. Amazon customer service said they will refund they money n pick the order (I have a confirmation
mail from amazon) which they have not initiated till now.",1
"One of the worst printer to date that I’ve used. It’s just a nightmare to print using this. Even if printing 2 pages is like a task. Pages are getting waste and the biggest mistake that I did was I did not process it for return. Now I have to either throw it or give it someone at whatever they pay for, I would definitely not recommend this product to any one.",1
"Very nice printer must buy it.u should only use this printer to print important documents ink will stay longer
""Not came in Amazon box,only in it's standard HP printer box"" ,that's not good and very risky.
No cd included in box have to download software from HP store",5
"The delivery from amazon was awesome. The hardware installation instructions are little bit difficult to follow.
The software installation was taking more than an hour and had difficult time in making the printer work in linux environment as often print queue crashes. Even in windows sometimes I face the issue. The print speed is very slow, may be you can print 3 pages in a minute. But it is value for the money though. Over all I am satisfied.",4
It does not print black. I tried all online resources but failed. Don't know what is wrong. Color ink is ok. Black is full but not giving output.,1
"Product is ok. But the delivery executive took rs 26 extra as he had no change. He assured he will add it to my Amazon pay account, but he didn't. Very bad behaviour. You lose the trust of your customers this way.",4
"It's jst 4 months that we buyed the product and it is not working.... It was fine till we were using the 1st cartage but after replacing it with a new one it stopped working...
It would be bst if you buy a gud printer spending some 8000 coz it would prove to be useful in long run and the cartage would be less expensive also.. the cartage with this printer is very expensive costing some 1500 for both colour and black&white and 1 cartage hardly print 100-150 pages so we have to change it time to time and it would dry up if we are not using it regularly so total waste of money. It is just wise to buy some gud printer with less price for cartage.☺️",1
"After printing around 26 pages of A4 size the black ink got empty and the colour ink indicated low. No colour print had been done. Very disappointing.
The cost of ink is too high .
Please see that it doesn't happen to another customer again.",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Printer is working good but slow functionality......Also getting good, clear copies for photos and printouts using this printer.....more important thing is maintenance charge is more.....best for only home purpose in this price and other extra catridges, photo sheets and paper sheets need to purchase separately.",4
"While installing the printer,it's showing that the black and white cartridge needs a replacement .
Even before printing I have to replace the cartridge.pathetic.",1
"Totally a scam👎... They keep the price very low just to seek the attention of the customer s.Cartridge price -700 and u can only print 120 pages from that Cartridge ...
Rather than this buy laser printer...",1
"If anyone wishes to buy this, please note that the cartridges are too expensive and you'll only print around 100 pages from each one of them. Go for the more economical versions of HP printers, whose cartridges are cheaper than this.",3
Some times the printer dint work. While some times it misprinted. But i would say it's ok. The most disappointing thing is ink which is very expensive. U can go for it but i will suggest look for some other brands. Small review after months of use. Not good for intense use.,3
"First one delivered was used and broken, but the seller exchanged it the very next day with a brand new one.
Printer is working as expected and the quality is good.",4
"Nice design
Excellent print quality
It takes an half minute to make a copy
Scanning performance is also good
But here is a PROBLEM 😥 with is the USB port which is connected through printer between our mobile or computer,giving a little bit of shock⚡🔌...so i kindly requested to manufacturers,improve insulation quality in the product... apart from this excellent product i loved it❤️

THANK YOU",4
I just bought the cheapest printer I could find for myself and turns out to be a good and worthy printer.. just that I found inserting a single sheet of paper is not very easy and seems like it has to be forced in.. but inserting more than 2 is easy and fits well.,5
Easy to use watched a youtube video for installation. Tried to take a photo print quality could be better. Can xerox.documents without a computer. Had to install driver online for scanning. Printer configures easily. If you can afford makes a bit of sense to spemd. 2k more for a wifi printer. All in all for 3k a home printer which can scan/Xerox is a good deal,4
"Print quality is excellent, more than expected, but catridge is not sufficient copis print. hardly can print only 5 to 6 colour A4 copies, also hp803 cartridge is expensive and cannot easily available.",4
No nonsense home printer for scanning and printing every day stuff - the TANK and WIRELESS variants proved to be an utter waste of money. This is good enough for me .,5
"Printer ink cartredge is not good, Black colour is getting over very soon and need to refill the ink often.. And technical support is not good at all.. And black cartredge is not working Properly unable to take prints.. HP technical people are telling to buy new cartredge even though my printer is under warrenty and totally Disatisfied with HP product.",1
"The black cartridge had worn out soon. Other cheap inks are not much of a use. If not used daily, concussion will form in the cartridge. Much bigger job. Atlast you'll be using this printer only for scanning. You can buy a cheap scanner for it. Why buy this waste package of expensive commodity which will pressure you to buy more and more HP cartridges and Ink again and again?",1
"I have purchased it about 6 months ago mainly for scanning, but not satisfied with scanner quality. Its scans blue ink signature as black and violet color stamp also not as violet as actual is, in other words its scan does not give true colors. Also, its printing consumes more color inks, which resulted in expensive printing costs.",2
"Unable to install and unable to get any support from Hp as the site goes on asking only questions and the product has no installation cd nor there is any support from the designated site they provide
Thinking of returning the product",1
अमेज़न से hp printer 2331 ऑर्डर किया जो बेकार प्रोडक्ट मिला है प्रिंट आउट देन पर प्रिंटर से पेज pickup नहीं हो रहा है और रिटर्न लगाये 2 महीने हो गया आर्डर को अभी तक अमेज़न की ओर से पिकउप नही किया गया है ओर अभी तक रिफण्ड भी नही किया गया हैं और मुझें अमेज़न की ओर से help नहीं मिला है हर बार मेरा नया पिक up बना दिया जाता है ओर आर्डर को pick up करने कोई भी नहीं आता हैं,1
"Buy this item after considering the following point, because the printing cost is very high. If we insert a new cartridge cost around Rs. 800/-, just 100 Nos of A4 size paper can be printed. Moreover refilled cartridge is not accepting this system. So consider this before buying ink jet printer..",1
After installing printer in October 2019 it worked only for one month with 802 black cartridge. Once it got finished bought HP 803 cartridge which was recommended by HP. It did not work. Followed HP instructions to sort out matter. Did not work. Then bought HP 802 cartridge because it had come with original printer. That too did not work. Since last 45 days attempted up teen times to contact helpline no. 18002000047. You just do not get it. Orange light continuously blinks. Have no idea what to do.,1
"Its a good product. Smooth printing + scanning. However, I am not sure how to connect mobile phone to it. But at this price its more than fine as I do not have much printing requirements just one or two in a month so its the best and most affordable product which suits such requirement.

Thank you Amazon !!",5
"It's a user friendly printer. Quick and easy installation. Even the elderly can print without any help ... which is a PLUS!!!
Highly recommend to those who want to print at home and doesn't want to invest much on a all-in-one printer.",4
Its Very Easy To Use.. and its worth buying but the problem is its ink costs about ₹700 for 100-150 pages.Good product but not so good... iF you are buying then please look for its ink too... Its only available in amazon😂,3
"Very bad experience, i m ordered new printer but i received already used one, 2nd hand, box already opened, and without catriage like colour and black both are misssing",1
"The HP printer is nice and functional, but the only issue I have faced is that while using it with LINUX the scanner does not work and the company is unable to help me resolve this. Overall it is a good product.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Perfect purchaching ... I like this printer n fully satisfied with my purchase...easy to set up with mobile n user friendly",5
"I am prime member but i received damaged, used ,old product. Black and color cartridges & usb cable are also missing. Very disappointed 😠😠😠😣",1
It's a nice and cheaper printer from hp for home use..... Nice print quality and with good scanning quality. Overall its recommended for home use,4
OK type product. Nothing fancy . Can't understand how to print monochrome instead of color print. I keep pressing the icon for monochrome printing but the damn thing keeps churning out color prints,4
"Waste product, Don't buy, better print outside.
After 20pages black cartridge finished, 805 price is too high.. U can't print per page @ ₹30",1
"Not so worth buying this printer, print quality is good, but the cartridge of this printer is very small and as they say on website that the cartridge can print 165 pages, it's just to fool the people for buying the product, actually the print is only of 45 pages only. This is same with black as well with colour cartridge. The prices of the cartridge is rs. 1400 to buy. Sorry to say this printer had failed because of the print cartridges only.",1
"This Printer price is so reasonable, performance quality is good.
I used it by from more than 3 years.
I thing which should be needed in this product that is ink tank. Best product in this rate.",5
West of money dont buy this product worst product this froud cheater online purchase amazon specification distils 100 page print per cartridges but 25 page printing next empty cartridges so friends pliz dont buy this product and online purchase who responsible repairs small small problems go the service shop no response shop workers so 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏,1
"Printer HP 2131 order placed on 9th August, which got delivered on 14th Aug 2019. Having problem with colour printing, i.e. coloured copy too getting printed in black and white for some unknown reasons.
Thus, request you to arrange replacing with a good one at your earliest.
PLEASE ARRANGE REPLACING THE PRODUCT SINCE IT DOES NOT PRINT COLOURED IMAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND EVEN THE CARTRIDGES PROVIDED, DID NOT PRINT MORE THAN 15 -20 COPIES AND GOT EXHAUSTED.
PLEASE ACTION

It is supposed to be all in one. But scanning is a problem with this machine.,4
"Can use it as a showcase peice.
Prints only 10-20 colour pages and prints approximately 20 b&w papers.Then u r done with printing.
If u want to purchase new catridge it would cost around 2000.
You can purchase new printer again and use it as a showcase peice.",1
"Printer received without any damage. And it's working properly. Black cartridge with printer is not working, totally disappointed with the seller.",2
Very nice. The last two papers were printed by the printer. Black and colour ink is included with it. Go to 123.hp.com and start it setup for easy setup. The printer has many functions. And the printer is perfect and has no issues. Excellent product,5
It's a good printer for the price only drawback is the paper feeder is on top paper doesn't remain stiff and gets folded so a bit disappointed with that,3
Good but it ink consumption is very high and it is better to say print is cheaper than ink also its scanner quality is not so good if u r buying for scanner purpose than buy 5500 hp printer i am using it too,4
"Didn’t like the packaging and the product seems like used one.

Delivered cartridges/ refill delivered are used one (Empty)",1
"I don't recommend. My personal experience, it will cost you more than taking print out in some browsing centre. Because only high end printers gives more printout for single caridge full. This machine, if you replace carridges / fill it, for 800 rupees, it can produce 60 to 70...print out.. Which will cost outside 350 rupees..",2
"Didn't get the CD to install, so I visited the HP Website and followed the instructions. I don't prefer to buy this again as the cost of cartridge is high. The print quality is somewhat okay, but not satisfied with the scanner. The automatic ""beautification"" will push me into trouble. Hope to get an ink tank printer.",1
"print quality is good......this product with 1 year warranty.... but if any problem with your printer in warranty period, you want to replace your printer then amazon not responce to your call.
i purchase this product but after some months my product are not worrking correctly, i call amazon and talk to amazon costomer center and say my printer is not worrking after amazon costomer service center are cancelled my call all time.................i am angryyyyyy",4
It's not 2331 product it's 2330 model number now in may this printer broke down just lasted 5 month don't buy this product,1
"I purchased this product from amazon on dec 7 2019, and hardly used this product. The cartridge ran out on 5th June 2020. When called the support they said that this printer has been used for 4000 prints and 3 cartridges have been changed, I have been given an old and used printer and old cartridges. I suggest do not buy printers or electronic stuff online they give refurbished items.",1
They sell you these printers super cheap to rope you in. Each cartridge costs 900 now. That's daylight robbery. I should have just gone to my neighbour shop to get stuff printed. If u are a heavy or medium user don't buy this. Scanner is good.,1
"For this price it’s a good printer, the scanner is a good too, but the problem is the ink don’t walk it runs, that’s the con. Moreover if you buy a new 803 ink it cost half the price of the new printer and if you inject ink it doesn’t show the ink level and the printing quality decreases.",5
Its too good for house use...and its very light in weight and u can connect and use by using installing hp smart from Microsoft store.and from the catradges pf 805 color ull get 150 prints .and black is 200 and i have tested just people who want it u can go for it..,5
"Did now like the printer at all , its damn slow , i feel i just wasted my money , and as i delayed in testing it by a couple of days from exchange period , they did not consider it for return as well,
Now its just a useless box , Scans are fine , but totally not worth",1
"Dont buy, Basically i dont write review but took sometime to do it becoz catridge prints only 100 paper and cost of catridge is too high, u can travel 15 km to take printout in that cost",1
"This is ok for home use. Cartridge dries up quickly so dont buy if you only print rarely.
If you have 2-3 prints at least twice a week then go for it. Scan and Copy features are handly.. no need to go out to get photocopies!",4
The printer has stopped working...even though the black cartridge is not finished but the printed has stopped working...I got this printer on 29th june....its been only few days its performance is not good...,3
"Cost effective printer for infrequent use. Good all in one viz xeroxing( copying), colour and b/w. Satisfied with its performance.",5
Good but for some time this 803 cartridge was not available for some time recently I purchased 803 cartridge not yet stars usage,3
"They will rob you in the name of buying other cartridge when it's out of ink. It doesn't accept refilled catridges. You can do nothing but be forced to buy catridges from the company. Once you buy catridges, it will be the same price as or next to a new printer.",1
"1) first of all it is not 2131 series it is 2130 series
2) prints only 50 pages of black& white and 35-40 of color
3) cartridges are very costly ( both b&w and color )
4) you will have to only use compatible cardridges i.e only HP cartridge compulsory
5) no refill, no print.
so according to my experience waste of money with useless restrictions.",1
"Pretty good product for true value of money if only paper insertion was a bit convenient, but considering the low cost and getting scanner also is a budget blaster.",5
"Good product. Only drawback is refills are costly.
Decent for occasional prints.",5
Sorry to say but it's a waste of money... I bought this printer for my home use believe me it gave me 15 pages only then I bought colour and blank cartridge of HP 803 and gave me 19 pages only of colour and now the black cartridge light is blinking continuesly and no one to help me I am like struggling with this waste product... Amazon should not incaurage such product... I want my money back for this... Hope amazon will help me...,1
Cartridge very costly and no longer life. Very low count printouts. Scanner only used. Cartridge not available in market easily.,1
"A very good product at this price. Easy to use. basic printer. The print and scan quality is pretty good. I have been using it only for a month, so cant comment on the ink usage yet. Overall a product for home printing needs.",5
"Nice printer for this price range.

I knew ink cartridge price is rs.800.
But you cant buy gocolour ink bottle and you can refill yourself.

3x 100 ml black ink = rs.500

100ml bottle = 1000 page print

Just refill the ink using syringe. and njoy printing.",5
"This item is a HP Printer which is totally slow for printing a paper.. color or black & white both. And I haven't expected performance like that. Very bad
I want to return this item..
But u haven't show option for return this item",1

Price worthy.",4
"2131 is good for home and personal use with limited prints a month! Print cost is high as compared to laser, inktank etc... If you download HP module, it helps for cleaning, alignment. This can do A4 size scanning. No software received along with the order so I had to struggle to get the 2131 drivers to install on system. No idea about after sale service of HP.",5
"product is very good. print quality , scanning quality is also very good.
but the main issue is ink one cartridge and print 70 to 80 pages it also depends on the what you are printing
and Ink is very expensive.",4

Printing is very super scanning and copy first printing first I am really like this product because easy use and this which are very smooch and the first look is very beautiful and this product price range that product is is good and trending fast I am very like this product
The Amazon packages very super and one problem no this in this package that is a problem budget friendly printer",5
HP 2131 All-in-one printer purchased from Amazon on May 2020. Seller is Appario Retail Private limited. Product is now non-operational. Discovered that the warranty service has already expired as on October 2017! This means Amazon is promoting sale of old outdated products! I want replacement to new printer immediately!,1
It is good but I will suggest to buy the Bluetooth connection modle for more ease of use and the new cartridge cost is to high.,4
I request every one to read the reviews and than buy any product.....I liked most of the things in it except for the cartridge system it's been only few weeks (2 weeks) since we have bought.....We haven't printed any thing except for 2 or 3 prints the cartridge got finished..... If this is gonna happen after every 1 week then ths our loss we cant keep on buying the cartridge every nxt day.....Hope they'll work on this tooo.....,1
"Worst printer, in terms of cartridge usage. Each cartridge costs not less than 750/- and prints only 50-60 pages(black). If you print color picture it will give only 8-9 color pages printout.",1

Happy to say that it is great for home use and the print quality is very good.
It was easy to install as well and comes with cartridges.",5
"easy to use the printer, need to download the application from hp website to connect with laptop, printing the paper is too good,scanner works good, only default is ink in the printer comes only for few papers",4
"Easy usability, but ink cartridge is too small and pricy to buy... per page cost is very high. Only for occasional use. HP made a product that is cheap to buy, but very expensive to use.",5
Please dont buy this printer the ink cannot be refilled. Each time new catridge should be used wich cost around 700. Go for a printer where the ink can be manually refilled that is more economic than such kind of printers.,2
In clear words DO NOT BUY this printer because of cartridge you need to refill it after after every around 30 pages print and after refilling twice you have to chnage the cartridge. Regretting after 6 months. Go for laser printer. Because in long term you will see laser will be cost effective than inkjet.,1
If u are ready to pay 12 rs per paper then buy this printer.So expensive to maintain this.Catridges are so expensive.we are buying almost 2 cartridges per month that menas we are spending 1600 per month only for catridges.,1
"A fantastic printer for this price.

You can only use this for your homes.

Keep it to yourself if you run out of ink in it.

Buying a new cartridge can be expensive.

My mark 70%",4
this product is for one time use. Once the cartridge finishes it will become wastage of money as it will not work after that. Even i refill the cartridge it doesn't work. Then I ordered a new cartridge even after that this printer is not working.,1
"Best printer for money.
Excellent black snd white, as well as colour.
Fast print
Easy to install.
Till now no problem",5
"Idiots they didnt give me installation CD
Then I installed from net.This model no driver is also not available I had installed another model no which is working somewhat in my printer.",3
"This is a very good printer for home, but soon you realize it's too expensive and not viable. My cartridge was over in less than 80 pages and black n white cartridge would cost more than rs 800. For me this is just a box now, I cant afford rs10 per page.",2
It is not easy to use....better not to buy from Amazon as the return is not possible in the dissatisfied case....Duplex printing s not possible. Print quality s very poor.Not even 50 pages printed ink got over.Not budget friendly,1
"Cartirage cost is very expensive around 800 , only 50 to 60 page overall print by this printer , i prefer Epson printer with tank , under rs 5000 ink jet printer is wastege of money. dont buy this very disappointing result. baaki apki icha hai , i dont recommend this printer .",1
Pathetic product from hp. The print quality Is absolutely bad. It hangs up again and again it does not give print at a time. After one print it stops printing and the customer service is also pathetic and bad I have tell them to give a demo but they not listen our problem i tell them to send a technician they said we can fix it from here how is this possible. So I am giving one star for this printer,1
"Printer is good but i prefer don't use deskjet printer, both cartridge cost is Rs.2000+ and you can only print maximum 100 Pages in B&W and 20-30 Pages in Color.
Its a very costly deal for me...
Looking forward to a laser printer...",3
"The HP Deskjet 2131 printer is really good. But when it comes to cartridges (HP 803), it is found to be too costly. The printer costs a little over Rs3200 whereas the cartridges cost over Rs1700. Considering that a set of cartridges produce hardly 100-110 quality prints (HP claims 1000 pages, but I never got), this printer is not cost-effective overall.",2
"Color cartridge received is damaged one and printer led blink whenever this cartridge is put inside the slot. On browsing the HP website I have found that this product warranty has expired before it was delivered to me. It is shocking how can you sell product whose warranty has already expired around 2 years back.
Stop making fool of customer and replace this product immediately.",2
"This a really bad product.HP has just made this printer to show that they are making the cheapest printer or product😭😭but its cost comes to be very high bcoz the cartridge are costly and has to be changed every mnth.Pls do not buy this ,this just a waste of money.they are not even returning now i want to return the product.🤒",1
"As you can see print quality is very bad
Never buy totally waste of money . If you want to buy buy laser printer it is very bad and also delivery is very late even copy quality is bad never buy this if want to buy printer then laser printer. Laser printers are very good also use can use for long days",1
"It's printing quality is good but everytime there is a lot of problem while reusing it.
When I go to the service center of HP when there is some problem there is no response and I have to get it repaired outside in market while it is in guarantee period of 4 years",2
Print quality is very bad...use and throw cartridge which very expensive to buy and also it gets over very soon..doesn't even get back the money of cartridge.. waste of Money,1
"I could not yet got the feed back from Amazon as I want to return it. This is defective product -Incompatible Color cartridge. Contacted HP help as advised. Hp is telling they require every details of trouble shooting so that they may be able to give some suggestions , Horrible experience. Just 05 days back the material has reached, I don't know what to do . It is lying on my table just as Junk.",1
I do not like printer. Actually i order for HP deskjet 2131 but seller send me HP 2130. It is hopeless printer. I advice don't buy this product. Only 25 copies I print. And black cartridge ink become empty.,1
The ink is really expensive and only prints 120 pages being a frequest user its worthless to buy this nd instead visit the photocopy shop which will be at cheaper cost.,1
"I like the fact that it's compact, it fits perfectly in the table that has my desktop!. It's easy to setup - windows users can download the printer setup and driver software from hp website (if you don't have the software CD) and that's pretty much it!. As far as text documents are concerned, the print quality is excellent.",5
"The product stopped working after two times use. Tried my best, it's showing 'Device Error' and stopped printing. Do not buy this HP printer.",1
I have not been able to download the drivers as the HP printer drivers are very user unfriendly. HP gives a wizard which is not allowing me to get and install the drivers of this printer. Can someone help me please on this,3
not a super printer. does the job. Print cost is high. Especially not good for photo printing.,3
"Installation is not an easy task, Driver provided by HP is not supported in PC having windows 8.1, additionally it required Microsoft.NET framework for fully operational. After that again having some issue of USB port.",4
"HP Always liked me a lot. There are several reasons to buy HP products.

1) Easy to Use
2) Availability of the Products and Accessories
3) Low Cost
4) Polite and Quick Customer Service",5
It's been a month since I bought this it's working fine without any problems. Scanner is also performed better. the only disadvantages is cartridge are too costly and can print about 120-150 pages .,4
Sometimes it doesnt print and it forces us to print a test page. The ink got over within 20 prints. It is rip off. Save some more money and buy a different brand.,1
"Extremely small ink cartridges. After every few pages, the cartridges run dry. Also, my 10 years old Epson printer has better print quality than this printer.",1
At this price is a good product but print speed is very slow and color page print 50 black page print 70 and (photo only 2 print than inked is a very very low amount showing),4
Dont buy any printer online in Amazon as after sometimes if you approach to manufacturer for some problem than they will inform you that product is not in warranty and his warranty is expired even before your buying date. These are selling you an out of warranty product.,1
"Very good printer for lesser price. It serve the purpose for home application. Scanning, copying, printing is very good. Very easy to install and refilling also quite simple for the Ink cartridge. Over all good product.",5
Affordable printer easy setup but the cartridge enclosed with it did not even give 50 sheets of printing both black and colour printouts,3
Good product we can refill the cartridges . By Using Hp printer refillable kit in Amazon . Good product I recommend to buy .,4
"It's okay, scanner, printer and copy(xerox) all are working ok good product, first I had received a product in which scanner not working and thank you Amazon for ur promt replacement of new product, now I it's working good, cartridge may be costly but for modern users at home for important documents it's ok we should not expect in business purpose in this price range it's ok for home use,",5
Dont buy pls cheating,1
"It look smart printer but,it did not set to ur laptop through given commands, we order given item is HP 2131 printer there shown in laptop printer models HP 2130.tell me how it shown this like? Otherwise you send old model item. Pls clarify it as early as possible.",3
Purchase after 10 day light blinking problem and i am so many time try to check the and refrefl and change the ink cartridges but this problem not slover it.. My suggestion is all printer buyers never purchase the hp deskjet 2131 printeramd print out and photo copy cost also hight to onther printer 🖨,1
"delivery was pretty good.
printer is good, print quality is much better.
single paper struck inside printer, not holding a single paper.
can print every type of paper.
but cartridge problem.
after filling my colour cartridge 4 to 5 times its showing that cartridge is not working.",3
Printer is worth for this price. But I have some struggle an installation time. Because they don't given driver CD. We need a net connection for this installation time. All people don't have internet connection in home. This is the main issue.,4
Pathetic printer...seller gave a used printer,1
Amazon cheated me. I purchased this product on 7th May 2019. It has a warranty period of 1year. Recently i observed that printing quality is becoming very poor. So decided to contact HP costomer care for repair. When I checked the warranty period i got terribly shocked because it's warranty period has already expired on September 2019. Right now i just don't know what to do.,1
Of course very easy to install and use . Pls buy this only if you print around 100 pages per year . If you print more then go for laser jet or any other printer which dont use ink cartridges like this printer which costs you more than the printers MRP.,4
"Print quality is very nice , however printing time is more as printing is very slow, cartridge ink level is also very less considering the high cost of cartridges. scanning quality is also pretty good.
Overall a decent printer.",3
"It is sooo slow at such level that if you want to print a copy from laptop to printer,in just 1sheet it take aroung 1 min....yeah speed is descent in scanning but in printing from mobile or laptop it is terrible",3
"Cartridges are more costly compared to printers... Once you buy this printer, then after 150 pages you have to buy a cartridge and the starting price of a cartridge is 1800/-.
From my perspective, you have to buy a printer with an ink tank which is better than this printer.",2
"Use less got problem show error every where on computer on cartridges ,. Totally waste of money.....never buy cartridge printer /instead buy ink tank printers ,,,",1
"Since it is not working with my Mack Book can I replace it with HP 2723. I shall pay you difference in cash at the time of delivery and return you full

"The printer ink is very expensive. If you do t use it regularly the ink dries up. We have stopped using it altogether. 1700 for the cartridge

"Amazon made me big fool.printer hardware was already damaged it is not scanning,printing anything that's why i will say we should not purchase it from online.I have called Hp call centre they booked my complain.Their engineer will call me in between 2 days.Very Sad.please purchase from shop.",1
It is good for people who do not print a lot bcz of the Per Page price and it is good looking and light weight product,4
"Cartridge is a small size and very costly.

Do not go for it.

Refill of cartridge is possible at select local. Places but that too girl best just 40 pages.

Size of cartridge is small",1
"I like the easy setup and not so complicated functions, black and white print comes out absolutely well but the coloured print is not as it should be over all it’s value for money",5
"Okay printer but not very user friendly with pull out paper stacker support, poor visual guide for functions and extremely costly ink cartridges.",3
"No help to install the printer. the CD was missing. We were used to call hardware people to install it and pay for it too.
the cartridge is too small may not last even few printouts.",2
"Very easy to use and install
Good design
Does not take much space
Copy print and scan
Color and b/w
Good price

Few cons
- no wifi printing
- use cartidges hence frequent use required for maintenance",4
The ink is finished so soon and catridge very expensive. Never buy printer from HP. They offer the printer with good price and ink cartridges very VERY expensive,1
"Poor cartridge quality. Does NOT print after 8-10 prints, although the app shows more than 70% ink. Appears that ink dries out in storage of 2-3 months. Not worth buying new cartridge around 1K every time.",1
प्रिंट करते वक्त 2-3 पेपर लाइनिंग के साथ ब्लैंक निकलते हैं खाली निकलते हैं और काफी समय लगता है काले रंग की धारियां बनती हैं बार-बार प्रिंट की कमांड देनी पड़ती है,2
"Plz dont buy this, max 50 pages with the first both cartridges and very expensive to ŕeplace new cartridges.",1
Nice...But after printing 28 hd color print paper ..It got a grin tint isse...When it resolved then a new one arrived. Which is chrome color prints ... I don't know what it's actually happened and one time the scanner also stopped working again buy on your own risk,3
"If you think you need a reason to spend money unnecessarily for fun, go for it. Otherwise whoever recommends this product are LIARS.
The cartridge will get it your head, ruin your day and burn your money.
Worst product I have purchased on Amazon!!! And I am still regretting. Whoever wants my printer can have it.",1
"If you want a cheap moderate printer then its ok. Keeping in mind to use for 2 to 3 yrs of moderate usage as catriges cost sky high.
Else go for tank printers if you want high usage at cheaper cost.
Think thoroughly before choosing.
Goodluck.",4
"Its like keeping an elephant as a pet.
Everything is fine, but cartridges will clean your pockets. Not recommended at all.",1
"I am very happy buy in this kind of product HP DeskJet 2131 All-in-One Inkjet Colour Printer to Scanning, Copy, Printing this three functions are very easily method in with easily instal printer.",5
Easy to install easy to use but after ink is over in cartridge means we want to buy another printer or another cartridge waste of our money.no printing is coming if we fill ink in cartridge. I buy two printers waste of money.,1
Worst quality product. Didn’t have usb and power cable so i had to use from my old printer. The print quality was also bad as the printer couldn’t print anything. I had the old printer and used for many years and thought to buy in similar range but was disappointed,1
This model is just right for home\personal use. It's printing capabilities is great for documents but not so great for photos. Its scanning capabilities are great all around. The only limitation for scanning is its size. Other than that this printer does what it is designed to do.,5
Don't buy this printer. I ordered printer on july 2020. It was working good till sept 2020. After that it stopped working properly. Very bad experience because ink cartriedge also not available online offline. No service centre available. So i request not to buy this product.,1
"packaging awesome, print quality is good, printing speed is fast, very nice product go fo it without thinking. Love d product, love d packaging, love amazon.😍😍😍😍",5
Hp printer is good performance and nice priniting we can useprnter to scan and print and scan normally and we can connect mobile through usd port and we can print for 3300 i bought that price the printer is very good thanks for giving good product to Amazon,5

MY MOBILE +91 9819823658",1
Good Product.The price is low and it's worth the price because it's scanner+Printer. The wrapping was also good.Liked the product very much.,5
"it was not printing even, I was trying all the customer numbers of HP but no number was working and I have registered online complain also but no reply.

it wasted my 4 days, in downloading software, installing, uninstalling but nothing worked out.",2
good quality in printing but the ink will be over after printing of 40 to 50 pages only. maintenance is time taking process and more money have to spent for additional tool kit.,3
Installing is difficult so it's better to get it done by HP. I had a tuff time,4
"Worst printer ever for those who need to print even a dozen pages a day.
Go for some other printers in that case.
For those who print once in a while, should buy. Everyone else should avoid it otherwise.",1
The main problem with this prinyer is the cost of cartridge which is very very expensive. Not recommended at all. Very disappointed.,1
"Good printer. Cartridge cost will be too expensive.
You can checkout ink tank printer.
Inktank printer is good choice.",2
"The internal packing was broken and since I was short of time, I was not able to report it back. I've read similar issues reported by other users.

The scan quality is very very bad.

Installation CD was missing and it took me a while to find the desired drivers online.

Sorry but I won't recommend this product.",2
"The cartridge is too costly to maintain. Once the ink is finished, we can't refill the cartridge with the ink. Even if we try to fill the cartridge with the ink, the pages turn out to be blank or void of the respective color. Hence, the cartridge has to be replaced again, which makes it very costly to maintain.",3
I generally don't write review but this time have to and it's like the worst experience. Thought it's cost friendly while buying it but once ink finishes it's just useless box on table. I also don't understand why tiny inkbox cost is Rs.1700.,1
very bad and costly product it could print only 40 pages in one cartridge and new cartridge costs 700 Rs so printing becomes costlier,1
"not good at all.. always facing a problem to fetch papers.. i bought this in April 2019, since October 2019 it is not fetching papers any more...and this printer consume ink so much either black & white or colour print",3
"INK catridge out of stock, I have enquired online and near by shop, nowhere 803 black ink catridge available. So printer is not in use. it was not a good decision to buy this printer. I should have gone for some other brand.",1
"I have took three prints until now (all black) and they all are dark and legible. There is no flaw with printing as such, However, the scanner is not working when attaching the device to the laptop.",4
"Well better for less use ! If have more than 100 prints frequently then never ever go for it !
It's ink cartridge is very less and is for sometimes use!!(less use)
Really easy to instal and it has a problem MAJOR
u have to change the settings of paper size
Hope makes a sense",4
"Print & Scan qualities are good. Very useful until future becomes ""Digital correspondence only - completely paperless"", even then its going to work as good scanner for digital storage.",5
"There was no technician attending to my problem even after e-mailing them. Also asked for replacing the cartridges, which till today did not materialize. The printer hardware has 1 year warranty along with software media warranty of 90 days. The product was purchased in January, 2020. Can you HELP ?",3
"Its al in one printer..good quality and al the stuff but ink drains off very fast...it gives only 200 pages max for 2 ink cartridges (blank n white)
Ink cartridges are too costly...otherwise its the best printer",5
I don't recommend buying this printer.v It's ink cartridges are small capacity and expensive. Initially supplied cartridge printed barely 27 pages. This printer may look cheap but operating cost is very high.,1
"Once the cartridge coming with the printer drains out, it will be too costly to buy new cartridges(more than 1000rs). The cartridges come along with the printer lost only for 150 prints (100 back and white and 50 color)",3
"I fitted ink tank to this printer externally, since catridge is expensive.",3
"It's good for home use.
But colour ink is empty in only 4 print out its too expensive due to this.",5
"Supllier cheated us.Disscount which attracted us ,supplier covers that discount by supplying old dry ink cartage,print only 25 document and 2 color document and message start coming change your ink.Very sad by this kind of cheatingAmazon should make some strict regulations and controll on thier registered supplier. Ultimately Amazon name is on stake.",5
"No Driver CD, No Catridge received with this Printer. Only a link is mentioned and when its clicked, it takes you to download HP Smart Desktop Application from Microsoft Store.
For other drivers, I had to Google ® and download them, which is a cumbersome procedure",4
For the printer the cost to use ratio is great. But the ink is its precious jewel. It feels like a trap once you finish using the free ink cartridges. Its uses Hp original 803 only which cost almost as much as the new printer.,5
"Great product for personal use. Cost effective and easy to install.

But you need to use the cartridge judiciously.

If you are on a low budget and you only need it for small scale printing and scanning. I would recommend this printer",5
"Product is best pricewise. Only thing is, sasta mehenga pad sakta hai. cartridge runs out fast. my suggestion, read amazon guide before buying product.",4
This one not best for budget. Catridges are finished within one month. After refilling cartridges are not working.,1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Worst product ever..
Plzz don't buy this..
Ink cartridge not recognised after some use..
HP makes people fool by selling cheap cost printers and selling high cost ink cartridge.",1
"Tried connecting it with 4 laptops and just failed to take one print. Everytime I try installing a drive it says not
Compatible with this laptop. I tried it with Mac, linux and a windows laptop too.",1
The worst product gave ever seen. Pl. Do not waste money on this product. Probably the 16th century priduct this is. The cartridge will not even last for 10-15 prints. I am now trying to return it...not sure if i can do it. HORRIBLE PRODUCT,1
"Easy to use and value for money but inkjet cartridge is Costly about 1500 for both colour and Black catridge which not last longer, So preferred to Leaser printer instead of inkjet printer.",4
Very nice product in this price. Very easy to install and use. Appropriate for small duty home use. Print quality is excellent. Don't forget to install HP Smart on your system.,5
"Printing does not stop even if the ink runs out.
Scanning and copying cannot be done without a computer.
I want you to improve.",2
"Not at all user friendly..ink gets used up so quickly. New ink is so expensive. Does not print photos on photo paper, it always give printer jam error for photo printing. Worst experience",1
Not wifi.. otherwise easy to use and cheaper,5
Don't buy this printer. I purchased HP 2130 about a year ago. Now the printer got damaged with warranty period. But HP didn't respond my mail. I asked every offline store for service but didn't get proper solution. Another problem is the cartage dried out if you don't print for 1 month!,1
"Good product and easy to use by installing
Software-Utility (1)

"Good product for home usage. Very easy to install, no complications at all. Works well in carrying out all three functions. Value for money.",5
First time receiving something in worst quality. I received a used product. It was fully dierty and also the ink was fully spilled over. Two cadridge was kept with the box which was opened and used.,1
Reasonable printer with good quality print. But cartridge consumption is too high. If in case of regular usage like kids homework this will be too costly. For rare usage it's fine.,4
"Model no mentiond 2331 but on papper information mentioned 2300 DeskJet
All details mentioned china company",3
Useless machine.. stops printing within month and thought may be Inc issue.. fillled Inc again and again.. still prints blnk pages.. worthless machine.. totally disappointed..,1
"Everything is okay
But it's taking cartridge is high

Print quality is not up to mark
Surely getting color variations after print out",4
Printer is very nice and good the best printer you will get it in this cheap price. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥the print quality is to next level. Just go and buy it blindly..........,5
"The printer is very handy and is not to heavy.The print quality,both color and black and white is absolutely fantastic.The installation is also very friendly.Overall, its a budget friendly printer with good performance.",5
I really cant connect the item through my laptop trying since yesterday it will be great if some body comes over so that they can run this printer on my laptop or else i have to refund it.,1
"the package met my expectation. it was very easy to install and comfortable to use. the only problem is the cost of the cartridges, it was costly. by viewing the previous reviews and all i understood to refill the cartridge easily with low investment. now it's only below 1 rupee per page for b&w. i love this product.",5
"This is so difficult to install the ink jet to the printer, but printer is so nice quality is also nice but the ink's price is too bad for buying another after the first ink catridge finishes.
And also this item is value for money.",5
Wonderful product in a very good and safe package. Arrived in time and the product is value for money specifically if you are looking for home printing purpose. All in one in this price is very good buy. Goo for it.,5
The Printer is good for only single use means for one hour after that when the colour sinks it is a dammn scrap.. who the hell manufactured it i dont understand you cannot refill it if you do so it will so an error of your cartridge has been damaged and the cartridge price bulshit thousandfive hundred,1
It's perfect... The printing quality is good.,5
Easy to use and amazing and amazing and amazing useful for every day print users,5
"Sucha quality product

Product mrp is 3860 i bought the product just for 3, 099",5
"Very good budget printer works fine but no installation CD given needs to download from the given link, rest all found good",5
Very good compact printer for home use. This is meant for printing in small quantities. This doesn't have duplex option but for small quantities one can manage it manually.,5
"I hardly printed 10-15 pages and it says replace cartridge.. don't buy printer if you don't use once in a day. Called customer care, they said the catridge need to be replaced.",1
Print quality is A grade upto the mark but cartridge is very small and finished after 250 black and white pages that is a headache as you have to refill it so often.,4
The print quality is superb. Easy to install. Only the main problem is the price of cartridge is too costly. For only occastional use not for daily use.,5
It was meant for sparing use at home. Still one can not expect such bad product.,1
"While I could use this easily, I am really disappointed with the cartridge, I have hardly printed 50 pages and in those 50 I would have printed 10 to 12 color print outs. And now it is not printing at all...",3
"Easy to install. You will have to manually look for the steps on google if you change your computer.
The catridge just comes up with capacity to print 20 or 25 prints. Thats a dud.",1
Amazon logistics did a great job again..... easy to setup .... though they should have made this model compatible with the HP Smart app.... .. as you can connect even wired printers to your Wireless networks ... Great product for the price.,4
Good product. No issues. But I later realised cud Bluetooth one with just 1500 rupees more,5
There was no installation CD in the box. So installation was difficult,5
"ink cartridge given along with printer lasts hardly 67 pages. and even printing in black and white,color cartridge also got consumed.",4
Very much user friendly and very useful for home purposes,4
Not that great print. I would recommend buyers to get a better printer. It is very costly in terms of print per page and the ink also get dry to quickly.,3
Don't by ink tank printers.. Buy ink and suction tool along with this printer and you can refill easily. I have refilled the cartridge more than 10 times. working fine,5
No star completely useless no one comes to install I could get some one after four days one day it worked when we took sample to see if it works after three four days tried it did not work tried to call company did not get any response no one picked up phone doesn't have clue how to get replaced or repaired please help!!!!,1
"I purchased this product a month ago, only printed couple of pages . This product had stopped working only after one month . I am very disappointed by company . Please tell me procedure for complaint registration.",1
The black & white cartridge did not even print 35 pages. Company promises 100 prints per cartridge and sells one cartridge for almost ₹600. Roughly ₹20 per page.,1
"It has been some time that I bought a this product. The printer quality is very good, but the cartilage drys up very fast like in a week.
Installation if pretty easy, the software is very user-friendly.",5
I really liked the product and easy to install and setup!,5
Its been hardly 15 days and the printer is giving issue. The cartridge is having ink but no print is coming. Now since the window for return is closed. Cannot return the product also. Please don't buy this instead go for Epson.,1
Printer is priced low however the ink didn’t last for more than 8 - 10 prints. Had to get it refilled and serviced. Not of great use for people who want to it for major use,3
"1. Very bad paper feed and paper sensor. Two pages get wasted before I get a good copy of one page. 2. If multiple pages are kept in paper feed tray, printing doesn’t happen and jam or half printing happens. 3. Print quality is very poor.",1
I still couldn't use product is defective. Ask HP guy to come and fix it as I spent more then 1000 rupees getting tech guys to come and fix it used to work for I will pay for Hp guys to for or give me a call 9820902408,1

It prints 80-100 pages in very good condition. But not works after printing 100 pages. It's cartridge damages. You have to buy new cartridge . So don't buy this printer. You can buy Epson printer of cost around 7000.,2

Per page Rs 10 it costs. Not affordable to buy cartridges,3
"Experience with this printer was worst. I just got 20 print out with the given ink and after that it was empty. Perhaps it was written in description that it will provide 100+ printouts.
Disappointed.

Ya the product's look was fantastic... But it took me quite some time to connect the device to my laptop... So ya... Everything else was perfect 💯,5
Excellent,5
The printer conked even within 50 prints. The seller appario retail has fudged the purchase date to 6 months before I actually purchased the printer. HP refuses to honour the warranty because of this ispite of me sending them the amazon invoice. Absolute crooks.,1
Service pbm ... Only five copies printed correctly without any problem after that all the copies I took everything had some problem... In Amazon this problem machine doesn't have any replacement also....,1
"the paper loading tray is shaky, and the sliding plastic adjuster is wobbly. Three cartridges tested for genuine got exhausted in 2 months. Now the HP Smart App shows cartridges are OK but printer is spewing out blank papers. HP needs to apologise to consumers for this pathetic product",1

This printer shall satisfy most of your Home Printing Needs. Only Downside being the cost of printing which can be altered by variable means like CISS Tanks or Catridge Refillers.,4

Not upto mark,3
"800 rs for a ink cartridge which can print 70 papers is a bad deal.

I brought this product 2 years back and couldn't utilize it in a good manner due to the expensive cartridge.

Printer cartridge can't print 100 pages. It can print up to 50 pages. But print quality is excellent. and also I use to refill cartridge to cut down its price.,4
Printer is good for home usage like if ur a student it is best choice for office it may be more costly costly for u.Cause it cards are more priced but it is ok for hime usage 👍👍👍,5

Easy to install and operate but it is not worth if you are not using the device frequently. I had to buy new cartridges as I rarely used for print purposes.,1
"Copy, Print and Scan functionalities in a good price. Though its like plug and play, easy to use but Print quality is poor and costly in terms of ink consumption. This is for them who needs to do paper stuff occasionally, not for those who needs to do frequently.",3
It's printing quality is very appreciable. Both scanner and printer works absolutely amazing. And if one has to carry out 15-20 prints in a month then simply go for it. You'll not regret it. But it works with windows system only.,4

No use of buying these products it's totally wastage of your money poor quality product so I suggest you don't buy.,1
Cheap and best.,4
Everything is ok.,5
"Fine one,Use thick paper, otherwise two or more papers comes out with the printed one.",4
Best for home use..,5
Nice product. Only thing is costly refilling.,5

"within a month , I hardly took 15 pages print outs & it says cartridge is low .",1
"Printer is good but cartridge is very very bad. Only 15 to 20 pages print after fully refill And after 2 or 3 refills, cartridge does not work....",1
SATISFIED . PRINT QUALITY IS AWESOME,5
"Cartridge ha to be changed timely and is costly, ink dries up within 2 days",4
Printing cost is very high. A ful tonner print only 30 copy,3
I have purchased this printer on 18th November the is HP all in one printer 2131 but the inkjets they gave are 2130 and the color print is of only 50 copies and the black and white are only 75 copies,1
good for home use only,4
Not good printer. Driver installation an issue. CD also not available,1
The print quality is really bad...The cartridge given with the product lasted only 30 printed pages. This is too bad.,1
Its ink is not available anywhere..ink dries after 20-30 pages...also very costly.. don't buy,1
Though it is available at less price but later on it will loose your pocket heavily in ink catriges.,3
Not working smoothly,4
Ek Month chala or kharab Ho Gaya..iska scanner bhi bekar tha.,1
Wastage of money. Exactly damn 30 prints...that’s it cartridge over...I bought this printer for 2950/-. Do u know the cartridge cost 1500/-. That means one print costs 50/-...r u a fool to buy this product....,1
They showing 2331 but we get 2330 and many time stuck paper,1
The product arrived on time in excellent condition. Works just fine. Printing on draft mode is fast. Print quality is very good. Finding it very handy. Delighted by the almost 50% discount.,5
WiFi operation wanted.,5
Value for money and good for home use.,5
Worst for the cost-effective perspective. Single printout costs around Rs11 which is ridiculous,1
"Though the printer is good, the cartridge has finished after printing 75 pages (after one month). I didn't expect it from HP product.",1

I used for 1 month and now the printer is having issue of paper dripping. Now it does not allow to paper to print. What is the solution to this issue.,1
Don't buy if you want to print a lot. This printer is for home use and very small use only. Print quality is good enough and it also comes with a scanner. It's good if you looking for a home printer with a scanner.,3
Works well with Windows laptop. Easy to install and use. But it is NOT compatible with Mac.,4
"Very nice product to startup a business for beginners at low cost and best quality xerox, printing, &scan.........",5

The printer was delivered on time and a really easy printer to use for students,5
Product is Ok...the offer is better than the product itself.,5
Print quality is superb also easy to install the software in laptop and product design is awesome,5
"Best printer,superb design and colour",5
Super and very easy installation and super printing quality but the cartridge cost is high anyway this is wonderful I suggest to buy it.,5
Worth the money.,4
Cartridge got ink low in just less than 100 pages print. Not getting any help from Amazon. Bad experience.,1
Never buy such a cheap printer. The cartridge goes dead in just 2 days of sedimentary phase.,1
Very nice,5
"OK for personal day to day use. Can't use for office purposes, or printing shop",4
To be frank pls don't buy this product..... The printer does not work.. And scaning was also not working,1
Very very bad product not supported in USB cable my money is waste,1
This printer is awesome but is ink cartridge very small and we can print colour papers 25 to 30 pages and black 30 to 40 pages that's why I give two stars,2
Very bad essentially they given problem printer it's not working only this of service your are giving were trusting that your brand but your given like this service I'm very disappointed,1
Till now great experience,5

My coloured cartridge not working after some days not even printed 20 30 prints !,3
We can't print the pages. Ifni print one page and then go to the second page.print of first page only keeps coming up,1
Reasonable and good but the cartridge is very expensive. So it's a false marketing.,3
The printing quality is good. But the machine stopped after 4 months. Now it is dead. Waste of money 😢😢,2
This product is no doubt one of the best from HP.,5
"Good product.
For a low price better product",4
It was provided with so called new cartridge however it just got over after printing just 20 pages.,1
No Wi-fi and the cartridges are very small and expensive. The printer is not economical !!,3
very very hopeless printer ... cartridges too costly and only 20 pages printed with 1 cartridge.. dont buy this printer,1

The cartridges are enormously expensive and use and throw. it cannot be refille and use.,3

"Cartridge ink level is low. Small count of papers print.
Scanning also in poor quality with compare to other models",3
Not compatible with MAC but its a value for money if you are using windows laptop or pc,3
What I dislike is that I am not able to print as the PAPER IS STICKING,2
A good product.. Consumes ink too much but still a good product.. Complete refill kit should be purchased from amazon.in and people can see the videos from YouTube for that.... IT IS GOOD FOR A NORMAL DAY TO DAY USER......,5
Nothing working with in month it's got repair,2
"The catridge that came with the printer only ,, was like a demo.. printed only 5 papers.

"I had been using this printer for last one year, while the printer is good the cost per page is too high. One black or color cartridge can only print 30 to 35 odd page and the cost for both is rs.1500. So this is not worth the cost....",1
"I bought this printer in 2200 rs. I was very happy..
So i bought ink bottle(100ml 100 rs proline) in advance for refilling cartridge .
After empty the cartridge, I refill it with this ink.
But printer is blinking and show empty ink.
I taje print out..but it is blank without any text...

Then i read the status in ink cartridge that..."" FOR SINGLE USE ONLY"". See the given pic...

Now, new cartridge purchase karne ja raha hu... Dekho kya hota hai...",1
Very good product for day to day use...not for commercial purpose... Must have device in every home...Its print quality is good.but it take time to print... Overall it is quite durable and easy to install...,4
"NEVER EVER buy this printer. I got it at a ""sale"" price of 2500/- I think, don't remember exactly, didn't take many prints, but the cartridges got emptied. Now when I am trying to buy the cartridges from an HP dealer, the price of black and color cartridges together works out to more than 2100/-. I have never felt so cheated in my life.",1
"Used for 1 month printed almost 20 pages in colour and about 20 - 30 in black and white. Black cartridge can give up to 70 pages while colour can give 50 or more these are low quantity cartridges having less ink so printing will be less. Quality is very high , using good quality paper gives more clarity.",5
"This is a terrible tragedy. Do not buy these cheap products. My item was delivered on 09 Jan 18. Used it occasionally. Today I tried to print but it only returned blank pages. Only some color texts/designs are seen. I ask Amazon/HP to replace it immediately regardless of the time that has elasped, for promoting/selling a useless item. I expect immediate response from Amazon or HP.",1
"To all that are complaining about ink, it is a printer it prints using ink.
Just think about how printing is being done and you would realize how much ink is needed.
Think you should know before you buy:
# These economical printers are for home use and not commercial printing.
# If you buy this product and insert cheap cartridges you will ruin the printer sooner or later
# these printer are not meant to print you photo galleries that is a job for commercial printers
# if you putt a CISS on it you can significantly lower the cost of ink BUT AT AN ADDED RISK TO YOU PRINTER
# if you are a professional artist or designer you should know the colors are not correct for that sort of work this is an
economical printer hence doesn't have an extra processor for color accuracy.

For normal home use this is perfect and get the job done. Now i do not have to run to my local shop for prints, scans, photocopies and passport size photos.
Tip: to print passport size photos for filling different forms you can do the following
- buy photo paper
- download a free passport size photo template
- take a photo with light facing you so you facial features are clear
- adjust the photo into the template and
- print
Voila there you have it.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 So good printer light weight nice finishing so I happy print copy scan are fine print so smooth and perfect value of money thanks Amazon. Black cartridge also print 40 to 50 page only",5
Very bad quality stopped working after two time us . Bought warranty also but they are saying we need to go to HP authorised dealer . What a hassle .,1
"I am writing this review after 1 year, bought in July 2017 to meet my occasional prints need, was very much happy that I'm getting printer in very less price around 2500 which has, color, normal printing and scanning option would be great to have this, and finally I got it and used it happily but my happiness was not stay long when I realized that ink need refill. when I tried to buy cartridges, very much disappointed becoz it doesn't support refill, you have to buy new cartridges for both black/color print and for black it cost 900+ RS and Max you can print 100 copy.
so it's really costly right? you can easily get print from outside in 2/3 rs per copy max to max.
So my final suggestion would be if you are looking for your printing requirement and you think that it would cast less from outside, then you are wrong, for scanning you can go for it.",1
"This printer is very efficient for domestic use ,but not for business purpose. I can print up to70 copies at a stretch, but after that its cartiges want rest for a few hours. But by changing the cartiges,we can continue the printing again.",4
Product is of low cost but the due to the cost of cartridge the printer has cost me much more than that of the costly printer. Due to this 1 black and white print cost me more than 10 rupees which I can take from a cyber at Max to max 2 rupees and the colour print cost more than 20 rupees and which I can take at Max to max 10 rupees so the printer is looking of low cost but it high costing printer,1
"Cost of print can make you go bankrupt!!! If you are ready to spend
700-800 bucks on each cartridge go for it..otherwise don't...I tried a 100 ways to refill the cartridges but none of them worked...apparently this product seems a low cost thing but actually it will cost you way more when you start using it...worst product that makes fool out of people!!!",1
"One of the best printer with inkjet technology and it very basic in features easy to install and does it's working well.
It is a good choice for personal uses in low budgets.
It is as slow as it is expected being in a printer with inkjet technology.
The main thing to look after is the after sell service, and HP customer care is very good and the ink cartage available in very low cost ( relatively)",5
"this printer is a piece of crap sent by amazon, when i turn on light comes and doesnt print at all. tried reinstalling software and downloading drivers but no help. called up amazon support they gave me number to call up hp support.. i did call up and they took me to all troubleshooting but of no help. when i asked them to give me a dead on arrival letter (DOA) as was told to me by amazon,, the hp support people refused to give me saying printer is turning on and its not dead on arrival.. informed the same thing to amazon but they refused to acknowledge and help me in this... throw your money in dustbin instead of buying this printer. I was very regular at amazon but i think after this i rather move to flipkart or ebay...",1
It can't photocopy or scan an entire A4 size document. There will be parts on the bottom which will be cut off. The ink they send with the printer doesn't last very long and you'll find yourself soon looking for a new cartridge.,3
Printer is not working properly. Ink in the supplied catridge got exhausted after 30 to 35 print. This makes printing very costly as new catridge costs Rs 795 and it would give only 100 prints. Plz suggest what should i do and help me return the same.,1
"It is the best printer in this price. I can do all the work such as copy, printing, or scanning very easily. It does the work very quickly. It takes very less time to copy whether it is color copy or black & white copy. I am very happy with this produce. Thanks amazon. East or west, amazon is the best.",5
"Printer is good.but the only problem is with its cartridge and its printing cost,this is not a good choice for anyone,the new cartridge gave just 80 pages black print and vanished. New cartridge cost around Rs 981. So just calculate the printing cost is about Rs 12.25/page. So i don't recommend this printer for any purpose either home or office use.",3
"Box ok but loose part inside box making noise neither Amazon nor HP ready to help unable to get solution
Ashwini Syal",1
very bad printer please dont purchase its a waste of money.the images is not clearly printing colour printer is very bad .i am not satisfied with this product worst very bad prinet.,2
"after sales service is pathetic, service center in faridabad is pathetic, useless service center, i had to wait for 25 days for replacement of defective cartridge. after sales service has to be improved, need to improve service centers.

HP 2332 Deskjet Colour Printer is Superb, Fantastic, Excellent, very nice looks.",5
Excellent product with good well packed... Very very satisfied.... Print catridge cost also lower than any ink advantage catridge.... BLINDLY GO FOR THIS PRINTER ONLY FROM AMAZON AS IN FLIPKART FAKE BRAND SOLD BEWARE...,5
"Easily the best printer in this price range. Bought it for 3.1k

Huge upgrade over my old printer. Fast printing speed, no smudges, extremely good print quality. The scan quality is also extremely good. Scanned images have proper color ration and reproduction.
The setup took a little more time than expected. Other than that, awesome machine.",5
"A little about this printer:
1) Build quality: 3/5 - flimsy and prone to paper jams if paper is not inserted carefully.
2) Scan quality: 4/5 - really impressed with this one.
3) Print quality: 3/5 - OK for casual use. Not great, not bad either.
4) Software and drivers: 3/5 - installs a lot of unnecessary plugins, which cannot be unselected during installation. You have to manually remove each one after installation (e.g FTP plugin, Dropbox plugin, etc.)
5) Cartridges: 1/5 - no surprises here... 6 prints in, and the provided cartridges' ink levels have already dropped to 75%.
6) Additional points - unlike Canon, HP has its own Android app to print from a mobile phone via USB OTG cable, so that's a plus.

Since I only use a printer/scanner for emergencies (2-3 prints a month), I always go for the cheapest option, which in this case was this one for Rs. 3099/-. The only difference between HP DeskJet 2331 and 2332 is the colour (the former is violet-white and this one is grey-white) so grab whichever is cheaper. Inkjet printers are a scam in general - the printers are cheap but the cartridges are crazy expensive and the ink runs out before you can say the word 'PRINT'. If you're the type who prints a lot, better go for a laser printer. They are more cost efficient in the long run.",3
"Excellent product for home use....you can print around 120pages in black and white...and 100pages in colur...if you are rich then use new cartridges....all the times....but if you are not then...buy hp oroginal inks.....and fillup the cartridges...each time...with injection.....this will let you to print 6000 pages in 600Rs ...wherelse if you use cartridges...then you can print only 120pages in 600 rupees

Thank you.",5
"This was the worst printer i have ever ordered. Please dont buy this product at all. This product's ink cartridge finishes in less than month and with less than 100 prints. And if you buy a new cartridge then it will cost approx 1300 rs if bought of hp. That means it will cost approx half of the printer. Which means 1300 rs for just 100 prints. I would rather get it photocopied from a shop instead. 13rs per page . And I'm also very disappointed in hp co. Which is producing this product. And please consult any printer seller about this product and you definitely won't find any advantage.
Its totally not worth the money .",1
"If you are doing regular printing or official work then I would not recommend this, as this does not have ADF.

But if you print sometimes or occasionally like me for admit cards. train / plane tickets or other docs, then go for it. It has what it says, print, scan and copy features both color and black & white, I havee done all, no issues and comes at much lower price and that too from HP. So it is a good deal overall for home use.

Before using it make sure to remove all tapes inside as well as outside (there will be a manual for it in package so don't worry), slide the shifter where you put blank pages as it is not adjusted for A4 sized papers, load the cartridges properly (comes with the printer and easy to load as well) and register the product & install the software & drivers for it from HP site.",5
"The page started getting stuck from the very first day. Not a very good product from hp.
As if having this printer is not bad enough the customer services sucks. It is like adding insult to injury. There is no way to contact seller to fix the issue, only channel of communication was Amazon's canned response chat, and that was pathetic as it didn't even give me option to list my issues.It just kept on cycling through the same responses.

I'd give negative reviews if I could. AVOID AT ALL COSTS - NOT ONLY THIS PRINTER BUT THE SELLER AS WELL.",1
The look of the printer was great but the connection was vry poor when iwas connected to the laptop or phone . Other than the connection the remaining was great .,3
"Don't buy HP products. Learnt the hard way.

Firstly this product will not work with latest mac version, at least I could not get it to work after spend 3 hours trying everything possible in hp site and other internet suggestions. HP customer care is absolutely pathetic. They will receive the call and pretend that they are not able to hear. So, forget any support from HP.

Now amazon will say the the OS mentioned in the product is windows 10.7 so any other OS is your problem. There are answers here telling this product works with mac and even in HP site it is mentioned this series does not need a driver for mac (mac is preinstalled with the drivers) and can print/scan. But I doubt it works with the latest mac OS, maybe it works with older versions.

My suggestion is avoid this unless you use windows 10.7 as you will not get any help from Amazon or HP.

Also, preferably buy a wireless printer as that way you can try printing from your ipad or mobile other than you laptop, but for this wired dumbbox there's not much to do",1
Product is not installing in my laptop. And neither I am able to replace the product nor I am getting any technical assistant help.,1
"I just received my printer today. After printer set up and driver installation, I am providing my review. I am very happy with the packaging, printing and xerox quality. Though scanning quality is okay, can't say it superb. To conclude, good printer at INR 3,099/-.",4
"Order was delivered in a day by Amazon. Great work. But the printer installation is so 90s work. You need to physically go to HP site, download drivers and complete the installation. Who does all this in 2021? But here, HP wants you to waste 2 hrs to do all of this. And then too, you cannot be sure that copies would be printed. Took me another 15 min to figure out why the hell scanner is working but printer is not- inspite of installing everything correctly as per the process. Absolutely disgusting. Pls don't go for this. Invest in buying somehting non-HP.",1
"Works fine for the price I paid as an entry level printer . Needed to do a few prints during WHF and supports that perfectly. Once you get the drivers downloaded and setup it works fine . Need to restart the laptop from time to time when prints don’t go through but I think it’s a common software issue I’ve faced with another HP deskjet printer too
I had to order ink cartridges again as the ones supplied are just for starting and don’t have a lot of ink , so if you plan on printing a lot it makes sense to order that when your buying the printer",4
"The printer is worst.
And not returnable or refundable.
My 3100RS are wasted.
Please whoever it is of you are reading this comment I request you to not buying it.

Go for Epson or Canon or Brother printers instead of this.",1
"I wanted a printer for occasional use that would be economical also , so basis the description went ahead with this one. It says it comes with a preloaded cartridge ( black and colour) and can print 100 pages with one cartridge ( black ). I printed max 15 pages in first use ( 12 black and white and 3 colour). The next time I had to print something was a month later and the cartridge was out of ink already even though the levels were still showing the same as before. By the way the ink levels were showing low even when the printer was installed after delivery. I didn’t have the time to fight with Amazon for that so just let it go. It’s the worst ever experience and so disappointing to see Hp and Amazon both get away by selling such a shoddy product and also cheating the customer by sending almost empty catridges with a new product ( also doubtful because the printer had some dust marks but Amazon wasn’t ready to exchange and wanted to dump another one which we denied ). Please don’t buy this printer from Amazon and if you do please ensure to check if the cartridge is full.",1
Nice printer easy to use . Just install drivers before using in laptop . Got for only 3100 . I like the product as it is best for home usage but yes it is going to little bit costly in term of refilling.,5
"The product isn't good at all. They don't have a return policy, it takes lifetime to print a copy incase it decides to print or else it doesn't majority of the times.",1
"Don't buy the printer, very bad experience over last two months.
Both color and black printer cartridges cost more than Rs 2400 each time since the default one that comes with printer doesn't last longer. You will end up spending several thousands of rupees on cartridges alone since this printer wastes lot of pages with misprints.
I have been using several models of HP printers for more than 25 years.
Doesn't work with Mac OS, works with Windows 10 only but takes a while to get the printer installed.
Doesn't print anything some times.
When it decided to print it takes forever to print a page most of the time.
Doesn't get connected most of the time.
Can't print resolutions above 300 most of the time.
Haven't come across such basic printer in last 25 years.",1
"Writing review after a month. The print quality is good for general printing and also for photo printing on glossy papers. I printed almost 80 black and white pages and about 10 color pages. Yeah, the black cartridge is empty now. And by watching YouTube videos I refilled my black cartridge , with Aprodot ink (cost around Rs. 120) and it worked well. (Just put ~3 mL of ink in cartridge hole by a syringe). The printer costs me Rs. 3300.
Overall good printer ... better if you buy a wireless printer else it is awesome. And don't believe if anyone says refilling a cartridge don't work , as long you would take necessary precautions (just watch YouTube video) it will work fine.
JUST AN ADVICE - Cover your printer with cloth whenever you aren't using it :)",4
It's nice product for commercial as well as for private use...I personally used it...worth for money...but it is china made...and there is no bluetooth or wifi connectivity...so I feel this 2 disadvantages...but overall very nice product..go for it,4
"This is about the HP AIO Desk jet printer 2332, I bought on Amazon on 16th of Nov 2020.

The claimed printer print yield is 120 pages Black & White. Now, on 2nd of Dec'20, little over two weeks, I have so far printed about 55 pages , only text (no graphics so far) and Black and white.. and the printer reports no Black Ink.

50 Pages per cartridge is atrocious; outright loot and doesn't even meet the claimed product specifications as per HP (120 pages). My print need is about 150-200 pages per month, mostly B&W.. and @ 750 per Black cartridge, every month I cannot invest Rs 1500 to Rs 2150 on Black cartridges alone... the Printer cost itself if Rs 3,000/-. HP IS LOOTING CUSTOMERS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. But this is too much...

@ claimed print yield of 120 pages @ cartridge price of Rs 750, PP Print cost is 6.25. a local xerox company offers service at Rs 6 per page. What use is owning the printer?.
stop buying HP anymore.. Loyalty doesn't pay",1
"First I got the message that the order is been delivered but in actual it's not then I raised a request for return since there is no option for complaint on the product delivery apart from phone number Hence Amazon team quickly resolved my query and then the printer is delivered within 4 hours that time I thought I got trapped but it gets resolved quickly Thanks for that. As of now, it is working as expected let's hope for the best in the future.",4
"Mainly bought it for the scanner. Cartridges become dry if you don't use regularly. Mobile can't be connected to the printer. Every time you need a PC/Laptop for printing or scanning. But for copy/xerox you can use it directly.
My advice is to go for a wireless one.",4
I got 2 Cartridges with the Printer...one Black and One color plus I purchased one additional color Cartridge with offer...print scan and copy is very good quality for home use but for business use more good quality printer may be required...easy software installation and cartridge installation...Overall good Home use Printer in the market,4
If there is no internet availability the scanner wont scan even though the printer is DIRECTLY connected to desktop. The software hangs multiple times. Something urgent to print or scan then expect delays. All works fine till you reach your 2nd or 3rd cartridge then all these troubles start for software hangs,1
"Started malfunctioning from day one; Amazon replaced it, and the new unit has now started malfunctioning in less than 3 weeks time. As the return window is closed, we are unable to get the same replaced.",1
"Never ever purchase any product from amazon. They hardly entertain refund request. After complaining the issues, they will trouble you a lot giving various instructions for troubleshooting, will ask for images and a lot more. Only replacement is available. Flipkart is much better in this sense.",2
Value for money device..very useful and reliable if your primary requirement is scanning and low volume printing. The functionality of the HP Smart app on non-HP systems needs to be impoved.,5
"Very nice delivery.... i am impressed with the delivery quality, one of the best printer for home and small office purpose.

Blindly go for this printer its best among all.",5
"Printer is good, but the cartridges are very expensive, if you want more prints go for ink tank model.",3
"The all-in-one printer is a good value for money.

The only catch is, if you need to print large number of pages, inkjet is not a choice. A Laser printer would be a better choice. Laser printers are costly, but economical for heavy loads.

Another thing is, at least 1 color and 1 b/w print should be given per week to avoid the ink getting dried out.",5
Produt is good.... It is better than my old same model printer.,5
Very nice prouduct for office and home but delivary is not good,3
"I am very much satisfied with HP Deskjet printer purchased a month ago. It's very useful to my limited use of personal printing requirements. Though initially I had little problem with adding it to my Laptap, with the help of Support Team I could make it without much difficult. This product is very useful for personal use and also gives Value for money.",5
"Normally it is ok, but the USB cable is loose, very loose and I had to attach it with a cellotape",4
"Good product - the refill cartridges are costly - but value for money if you can refill at home.

It is good for home use - scans upto A4 and Letter sized papers.

I have been using this printer for a couple of months now and satisfied with the performance.",4
"Setting up was a bit difficult, but somehow I searched for the videos online and set it up. Took print out and scanned documents, at the rate it is worth it.",5
"I bought it on 15th April, this was delivered on 23rd April 2021. Since then, I have hardly printed 15-20 pages and its USB wire is not working.

Don't know whom to contact, I will try reaching out to HP, but you guys don't waste your money purchasing this.

Thanks,",1
Did not expect HP has printer issues in all the models and yet Amazon provided me with replacement. Now the new printer workes well.,4
Awesome product ... Looks sleek .. works very good ... Pretty fast and perfect printing ... So many features ... Very handy,5

"Excellent Product.. very easy to install..
Thank you Amazon and special thank to Seller having such product at low price...",5
"Its a complete no no. If you have to waste your money, only in that case you should buy it. HP has started making fools to the customers. This printer is just a box of no use. Never buy it. I am feeling like to be cheated. I am not suggesting anyone to buy HP printer ever.",1
"Good product at this price
Installation was little difficult
I searched for more than 4 hours and foundvthis as the best",4
Color print is not good but black n white super cool and specially for each day you have to print at least 1 page otherwise it's cartridges will be blocked,3
Although it do what is states i.e printing but the ink runs out very fast. Whintin 6 months of use i had to refill both the inks.. And let me remind you the ink refills are not cheap both the inks in total cost over Rs 1000 so i would suggest not to go for it,2

"Dear Friends
This is not Ink Advantage Printer...
It's just Inkjet Printer

Ink Advantage Cartridge will give 400 - 700 Pages (Both Colour and Black) If Used with Calibri and Times New Roman Fonts

But this Inkjet Cartridge will give only 100 to 150 Prints (Both Colour and Black)

It's just a Budget Printer for Giving Gift to Corporates...
Not for Long Run
Within Warranty Period if You Refill the Cartridge the Warranty will be Null and Void...
So always See for

Ink Advantage Printer

This is the worst product.. zero marks for functionality. cartridge doesn't print more than 50 pages... cartridge replacement is not economical.. if u try to get help from customer care they all time blame cartridge for non functioning and ask to change it...,1
Don't buy this they making you fool. If you got your printer damage or not working properly they can't give you refund. They just want time from you and after sometime they said your refund time has been finished. So don't buy this product. It's a request.,1
"Printing quality is good. This printer is quite light and is a good option if you have small daily or weekly requirements.
This doesn't allow you to print on both sides automatically, you have to fix it manually. Product is value for money.",4
"Good product, with reasonable price. Working good condition. I really thank for Amazon team members... Thanks all dears for your valuable support...",5
"Horrible printing. Don't buy this printer. When I tried to replace the printer amazon was telling if it works OK. What does ""working"" means for a printer to you? I am never going to buy anything from amazon again",1
"Quite good for small offices, not for heavy duty. Looks decent and worth for home usage. Can save time and money what one spends in front of Xerox/Stationary shop",5
"Print quality is outstanding at this price.
Very easy to install.i purchased it for my children's online study purpose.They needed printing of notes and assignments.",5
The print costs around Rs.15 per page. Good if less printing is required. Their 805 XL cartridge prints around 140 pages give or take. 805 prints around 60.,3
"Very slow printing

It's taken 15 minutes to print a single page today only I received but not certified will go to return this product . Sorry Mr seller please give best product to customers .",2
Cost efficient wondetfull printer quality no doubt if looking for a pocket friendly printer must go with this. Overall Wonderful product satisfied 😊,5
Print Quality is very good as well as Speed is very nice.Best to use at home as well as at office also.,5
"Best price of printer In Amazon ....
In this printer is hp
You buy this product. Bro and sisters
You buy this product. Bro and sisters",5
It is best for home use in this budget ! Go for it just the printing speed is some slow.,5
Excellent!! Delivered before time,5
For easy work from home use,4
amazing product with this price,5
its only print 3 to 4 page properly then started blur printing and no option for darkness and cartarage is very costly .,1
"Printer came damaged,While installing it gave error
Wich means Scanner damages,Worst customers support by canon,new product now under replacement after several call annoying support..
Will not recommend anyone to purchase printer online...Really disappointing",1
It is good only for plain paper printing. If you print on glossy paper its color spreads. Buy it only If you want to print on plain paper otherwise not.,3
Prints 500 rs notes properly but 2000 rs notes are not the right color. Not worth the money spent.,3
"Very good product,
Easy Installation, scanner picture quality is very good and printer quality also very very good, useful... Thank you Canon",5
"Got a defective piece. Very bad packaging. As soon as I got the printer and turned it on, the yellow light started blinking and I had to call the service center and they told scanner is defective when I told them the support code - 5011. They informed me that scanner is defective maybe because of manufacturing or due to delivery.",1
Useless printer. Please dont take. I got for 2k and cartridge left nothing after 30 prints or less. You will go on spending on cartridges which is 600 to 900. So printing cost around 20 to 30 for a bnw paper. Such a useless printer dont take if you got for a rupee also. You cannot fill ink only cartridges work.,1
"This printer is very light weight. For Print quality you can see the image printed on A4 size paper I have attached. I liked the print quality at such low price. Honestly if you want an all in one printer in low price you should buy this. I got the delivery today and installed the printer myself. If you'll need any assistance you can call the canon service centre their engineer will install it for you at a certain charge. It's easy to install yourself all you need to do is to read the manual, instructions carefully and follow step by step. Print speed is also ok. You'll not get a laserjet printer speed but it's completely fair with its price tag.",4
"BUT NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON PHOTO GLOSSY PAPER AS INKS (ALL FOUR COLORS) DOES NOT TOTALLY STICK TO THE PAPER. WE SHOULD WAIT FOR AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES BELOW THE FAST ROTATING FAN TO DRY THE PAPER. EVEN THEN IF YOU MOVE YOUR FINGER ON THE GLOSSY SHEET THE INK GETS DISTURBED AND PICTURE QUALITY LOOKS SHABBY. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING ON GLOSSY SHEETS.

REST ASSURED, FOR DAY TO DAY PRINTING THIS IS THE BEST PRINTER I HAVE USED SINCE HP 300 ALL IN ONE WHICH I PURCHASED IN 2005.",3
"Printer is cheap as of 2500,but but but
Cost of cartridge is 2400 approx
And if you want to buy cartridge daily then go for small cartridge which comes with this printer I.e extra small, which even fails to print 40pages
So cost of printing 1 paper becomes 20 to 25 per page.
Also very noisy in operations.

Better to spend 7000 on laser printer or inktank printer.",1
"I bought it Amazon sale for scanning the documents. Even after two years it is working well. Though printing quality is average, and it's cartridges are very expensive, but for emergency it is good, and best for scanning the documents and books. Till today I have scanned more thank 25000 pages, but no problem occurred. The only problem is that after about 1 year it's usb cable became faulty and I purchased other usb cable from a local store, and printer is working fine.",4
"This product is not working after one month of use. After using for one month, it showed cartridges ink is over, after replacement of ink, it stopped printing, on showing it to local shop, I got to know that it's chip is damaged. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it.",1
Very handy and light weight product but this product not comparable for photo printing,4
Installation is not free - they have taken Rs 1000 for installation - Why should they take money for first time installation,1
I am regreting after buying this price of waste.i was very happy happy while i bought this but as soon as the time come when the this printer ink got over i try to get the same in market and believe me the pg-745 xl cost me somewhere between 2500 to 2600 ah! thats the price of actual machine i simply thrown this peice of wasre in the dustbin and i rather bought a laser printer and that too b/w although that's not colour but it done the job perfectly. If you are going to buy this product buy at your own risk because at first it will be treat you good but after you buy this you will end up losing a good amount of money from your pocket.,1
The printer works fine but it's inks are very expensive. I landed purchasing more than rs.5000 worth of ink in one year. It's color cartridge only contact 1500,1
Carrying ends after 20 prints. Refilling samagra the cartridge. New cartridge costs 1000 rs each. Spanning and print quality is ok.,2
"Item not working, no option to return or replace the items .. even though replace option is showing in Amazon, it won't allow to replace request .. it will redirect to cannon service centre. But after selecting the model in ivr call, call will diconnect automatically .. not recommend to buy . No proper service alao",1
"100% satisfied with this product. The print & scan quality is excellent. Also the printing performance is super, printing 10 to 15 documents per minute. Really awesome, just I want to say thank you Amazon. I can't imagine how canon supply the wonderful printer in such type of budget. Rs.2300/- . Dear friends if you want to purchase a printer for home use then this is the ultimate choice, don't loss the opertunity. Go to Amazon app & order now....",5
"I needed a printer for home use. I was looking for something basic with all the three important features that a printer should have such as Printing, Copying and scanning. And like I said I needed something basic because for home use at best you're gonna need 4-5 prints in a month usually and not more. So I found this printer which I received just today. Does it do what it says? Yes, It does and overall it's a great product and I am quite satisfied with it's quality and features. Although the print quality could've been slightly better. Don't get me wrong overall it's a great product for it's price and comes with all the necessary accessories that you would need for a printer but the print quality is just above average. It does the job and it doesn't look bad. Just not great like you can see in other slightly expensive brands. Anyway I don't regret buying it. I still got more than what I paid for, therefore I am quite satisfied.",4
Printer installation is easy 3/5. printing speed is 3/5. Print quality is good 4/5. But worst thing is ink cartridge is getting low soon. Just for print of 6pages in which 3 are mix black and colour. It showed me the reduction of 10% of total ink.,3
Pathetic in the very beginning... Cannot be installed as the windows can't detect the printer. Canon customer care is useless. No support on call. Gave number of a local repair agency which is not recwiving the call. Waste of money and time.,1
"Very bad product.... Complete wastage of money
This product is not working After using for few pages your catrage is empty . after replacement of cartridge, it stopped printing. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. No warranty this product in canon service center only show in .Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it.",1
"I ordered this on 23rd October and the ink(black) was over on 3rd November. I printed just 12-15 pages in total. Either the ink cartridge was old or that’s how all the cartridges are. I’ll know once I replace the cartridge, but by then I might have to change the colour cartridge as well. All in all disappointed.
I’m still giving it 4 stars because the printer itself is easy to install and use. The print quality is good, too. I am using it for home use, so maybe I’ll use it for important documents only.
YET, totally annoyed with the cartridges provided.",4
"Good printer.
I bought it for ₹2000/- only and had got ₹700/- cashback. Overall price of the printer for me was ₹1300/- .
Prints pages at ₹0.50 each. Print quality is not too good but ok for home use. I donot change ink cartridge. I just refill them at home.
Scan quality is excellent.
Xerox is also good.
Software is also easy to install and easy to use.",5
"Low cost but Not recommended.
Print per page cost is high.
Only you will get 25 to 30 page.
Printing quality is okay.
Ink will quickly drain out.
Document scanning quality is not upto the mark . My passport scanning and very old document scanning quality is not good with this printer.
Other Document scanning quality is acceptable.",3
Very nice product..already used the same model for 5 years and now purchased again.good for use if you have to print 8-10 pages a day..cartridge are costly but can be refilled from any refill shop by paying 50/- rupees. Not very optimistic about color print since my requirement is for black and white prints daily.But you can definitely buy it if your usage is limited,5
"It's a great experience! It's my first Printer and enjoying the experience. Ease of use. Would upload the video on You Tube and update my review. I would appreciate if any IT support is provided for installation. I struggled a lot, but finally was able to when called up the IT support.

At this price, great buy. Black ink cartridge got exhausted. Got it refilled via Cartridge World. A genuine store. Great Service.",5
"What a crap.my catridge is low in just 15-20 printouts.
LISTEN EVERYONE.
DO NOT BUY ON AMAZON INDIA ANYTHING WHICH YOU THINK YOU CAN DIRECTLY PURCHASE FROM THE VENDOR NEAR YOU OR EVEN A STORE.
AMAZON FO NOT CARE IF YOUR ITEM IS BAD...
I PURCHASED A PRINTER N the ink finished in no time .whether you use the printer or no you still have to replace yr ink which finishes you use or no.
Amazon please sell product which can value peoples money. Atleast now when people are jobless during this pendenic.
Just dont sell product ehich put people hard earned money to a waste.",1
"Product is excellent with this price,easy to install and printing.picture quality is excellent,",5
"First, its beautiful bit delicate though!
Came well within quick time and had sturdy packaging, no complaints!
Easy to install. Has color and black cartidges which need to be fitted, just follow picture instructions.
CD for driver installation. If your laptop doesn't have CD player such as mine (surface pro 4), just google key words and download.
Once you install, go in start menu and open canon printers to scan documents.

To print, its ready to use without software installation. Print quality is good.

But, remember its for home use, worth for ~100 pages per month.
Use judiciously!

I dont know why bad reviews. Its adequate.
I purchased because i badly needed scan and print of my visa and option was same day delivery. I am happy.
Thank you.
If you want to purchase, go ahead!
If your use is heavy, buy next heavy version. For me its enough.",5
"its not working properly not even a single button works nor USB ,various noise. the very first time showing the upper black and colour ink orange light., printing apps too donot recognise it,and bluetooth is not working either.its diffective,today on sunday i got some extra time to work on it but my whole day is wasted.remove this item from amazon ,i want my refund.",1
"Please do not buy this product even if the company gives u for free. The ink if it gets over, after refilling it the printer does not work. If we buy cartridge it will be costly and the outcome cost /print does not come good also. Though it looks cheap to buy. But later you will suffer with this. Please don't buy this product and waste your 2800 RS also. Utilize that money somewhere else.",1
"I bought this very recently. So far so good. It is economical. We can print, copy, scan is what I liked.

What I didn't like is - the USB cable from printer to connect to external device (computer) could have been longer that what is given. It is tough sometimes to connect with laptop or computer which is placed just a bit longer to the printer.

What is missing - WiFi. Hmm, need to spend some more money for this. But it could have come for this price itself given the technology advancements so far ! I know I shouldn't expect though!

I'm happy as I've been using scan and prints (less) for a while. I used it for <2months now, since last week it won't turnon now :-) Not sure of the reason. Time to contact the customer support now :-).

If I get quick resolution in few days, then I'd update here and improve the rating ! Hence giving less rating for now!",3
"Well this all in one printer seems cool for its price but it will cost you more than you think.. The ink cartridges can print only a few pages and you need to buy new cateidges every time which costs around 400 alone.. So it will cost you too much... There is no refilling option you will have to buy a new cateidge itself...
Apart from that the scanning is good but the scanner option in there app doesn't work all the time.. It keeps saying location undeminded and stuff but if you keep trying and trying it will scan ultimately.. Well I won't recommend this.. Go buy some good product.. They might be costly but they will be worth it.",1
Got it 4 days ago . Made in Vietnam(not chinnese crap).Automatically got detected by my laptop and able to print directly .For printing from mobile using poko print app . Colour Print quality is good and can be seen in attached picture.Printer needs to be handeled carefully especislly flips at top and bottom as they look fragile .Need to check how many prints i will get before cartridges exhaust as it was one negative thing i have seen in majority of reviews .Iam going to order inkjet 100ml bottles to fill cartridges following youtube videos,4
"Cheapest printer which contain scanner and worth it for occasional use besides print cost is high than other printers per page so this printer is not for daily use . For students and other home stuffs this printer is worth to buy. Sometimes little minor issues can be happen but it can be solved by reading manual both offline and online. The print quality is ok , not so good but for occasional use its better to don't mind it . And the service it provides at this low price is worth it for buying.",3
I received twice and both time I received a defective product. Please Don't buy this product from Amazon,1
"Printer printed hardly 40 pages in draft mode and started displaying about exhausting condition of the black ink cartridges. While describing about the product, per page printing cost was not mentioned in the advertisement. This way an important aspect of per page printing cost or out put per cartridge was hidden. Such a high cost print can not be afforded, hence I would like to return the printer and get my money back. Would suggest to mention prints per cartridges or cost per print.",1
"update, it stopped working in less than 6 months. working fine for the price but manufacturer konwingly designed printer in a way that uses little colour ink for black print which u can clearly see as shadow and also in many reviews on internet so you get out of ink early, another thing is its catridge which is around half price of the printer which is also not available easily and printer is slower than tortoise. Good for small requirement in home and office or shop.",1
"I have been using this printer as a backup to my main printer(for office use, mainly PDF's) since almost 3 years now. Its easy to install and the scanner works well.The print quality is good but the print yield is very low. The cost of printing is too high. The cost of buying a replacing cartridge(too expensive)or getting the old one refilled is a task as if the refill is done wrong, it doesn't work or it leaks.

Suggestions don't buy this printer, look for a different one that you can refill ink easily or a laser printer that uses toner. Its cheaper in the long run.

PS : You can see how to open the old cartridge and refill it on YouTube and it works. Buy canon ink off amazon and use original Ink for better life.

"If you are looking for a colour printer in budget and want a brand like HP, you can definitely go for this one. The only thing is, you can get local ink bottle at 500rs for all colours, but the original one costs 1200rs per color. The ink cartridge level sensor has some issue but that doesn't affect the quality.
Yes we need to flush it sometimes so that we can get a clearer prinit.",4
"The Rs 2999 printer comes with small cartridges that run out of ink in less than 50 pages. New Standard size cartridges cost much more than the printer (don't bother buying S size similar to the ones this printers ship with). So, when you run out of ink, just buy a new printer and not ink cartridges. It's cheaper that way.

By the way, the printer is clunky and very very basic. No wifi or bluetooth connectivity, no built in paper cassette, no nothing. In this day and age when printers themselves are dinosaurs, this one is way too backward.",2
"wifi not available.inkjet cartige little bit small.ink attached with printer seen low after 14 print. you can never refill ink bcoz if once show ink low by chepset and not allowed use fefill ink even if it have refilled.
you have to buy new inkjet which is cost almost the printer cost.i put this printer aside and never use it.hence i buy tank refill ink sys. printer again which have 7000 pages print capasity and u can refill again.",2
"...but first, this came with an installation CD, how cute!

I got this for the scanner, which works well with Microsoft Scan. And some occasional print-outs and copies. The driver was auto-installed on plugging-in the USB connector. Now it quietly sits on the table, waiting to gobble-up super-expensive ink cartridges on a periodic basis.",5
"Its lightweight and easy to install and easy to use all in one print copy scan machine.

Printer is slow but does the job if you require few prints and color print quality is average.

Scan quality is good and was the main purpose of mine to buy this device.

All in all it does your basic jobs of printing scanning and copying albeit at an average quality but its absolutely worth the product price.",4
"I gifted this for my Father last month. As far as now, there are no issues. Performance is good enough for a home use. Regarding the INK, if one of the ink cartridge is empty, then the whole printing function will not take place. But we can find the ink for cheaper prices in amazon itself. Try not to use any 3rd party cartridges, as it may cause clogging in the ink nozzle.",5
"I just took 3-5 prints from it and it's light starts blinking ( black light) which means cartridge is about to empty, WTF is this, 1 cartridge cost 750-1000rs , and why the hell should I buy it to print 3-5 pages, I'm fine with quality but it's not good for printing much pages, and now if I refill it, it cost me 300-600rs , I guess it's not a good deal to do, although you can take it and can print 10-15 pages (as I think), or may be my ink got sucked as I use it very rarely, it's good but cost per page is heavy.",1
"If you are a student and need hard copies inorder to study then this the the printer for you...I must say that printing quality is not that good but we really do not need good quality for university notes...easy to use..real quick installation...from 1 Black and White cartridge I was able
to take approx 150 pages printout..so I assume I will be able to take another 100 print outs from colour cartridge....pretty good for university notes use..I am happy with the product (also for bulk use..you have refill it many times depending on pages)",5
"Pros
Its Japanese Company not Chinese (for those who care)
Compact and Lightweight
Printing Quality is very good
Printing Speed is fast
The Machine does not make much noise while printing

Con
Software installation part is cumbersome.
No Wifi (at this price u won't get any)",5
"-Quality printer at low price
-But the cartridge is costly
-MOST WORSE THING-THE USB CABLE THAT CONNECT PRINTER TO SYSTEM IS LESS THAN 1 METER!!!!SO IF I WANT TO CONNECT PRINTER TO MY PC I WANT TO BUY AN EXTRA PRINTER CABLE!!!!!!!
-Super Design ,Quality
-Super Printing and Copy Quality
-Bad Delivery Agent ,My Package was broken.",4
Firstly I thought it will not work but believe me after taking this printer I am very much comfortable with printing and one thing I wanted to say that after your ink gets over don't buy new ink pot instead of Refill it Again it will be very reasonable fir black jnkf refill it Charges around Rs100-150 and Colour Ink Refill Charges around Rs 150 you can go with the ink pot they will refill it very Reasonable Price 👍👍👍👍🖥️🖨️,5
"Ink cartridge is very expensive.
Not a good product",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 First thing, no issues with Amazon service delivery. My issue is with Canon. The device is totally useless and I wasn't able to print even a single page with this device. The product started showing error from the moment I pressed power button after unboxing it. If you are planning to buy a printer, please save your precious money and avoid buying useless Canon. After watching videos on YouTube I found many other customers are also facing the same issue time and again. Just think for yourself, why will you follow steps like press stop button 5 times then 4 times then 3 times and then maybe the printer will stop displaying blinking orange light. Don't follow these painful rituals and better go for HP! Canon doesn't even deserve one star !",1
"The printer is perfect for home use, hence don't expect rapid photocopy, it takes about 10~15 seconds to copy.
5/5 for quality of printer overall.
Now 1/5 is the canon interface available on PC, it's unrelated to printer directly however it's required to use copying.
It's behind the timeline, extremely slow and buggy.
I was expecting a fluid interface but it rather looks more like you're back in 2005 when windows XP used to make us wait till next click.",4
"I JUST SAY WORST PRODUCT. DONT BUY. STILL IF YOU ANY ONE WANT THE REVIEW GO AHEAD.
1. Yield is too less prints per ink cat. of 650 rupees.
2. always stuck
3. useless for any one. low speed.
i am throwing this product to dust bin. lost the money.

My friend is using epson printer which is giving very good yield per ink cat. they have not changed it at all. its still giving prints smoothly",1
Printer is good.Is in Budget. But the cartridge comes along with this product is PG 745s & CL 746s. It is said that both cartridges prints 200 (100 -100) pages. But I have just printed 10-13 pages and it is showing yellow light on Black ink on printer which means the ink is low. 😑,5
Very bad product.. stop working after 1 week and there is no help received from service centre and for servicing it i hv paid 500 rs today for a private shop to repaired it,1
"They send me faulty product. When I turned on the printer despite of getting started this printed on the first boot started flashing error light. When I installed the driver it showed me scanner error. When I check on internet I see maximum no. People's who bought it online has the same issue.
HP deskjet 2132 is far better than this the price is couple of bugs extra but the print quality is much better then this.",1

The printer I was ordered this canon MG 2557S
It is not working properly, its showing an error . after 8days of buying so I called to Amazon costumers service they said to call to authorised service centre I tried it many times. But here they telling to click 1 or 2 for help ,so I did it after 3 seconds call was end automatically.
So, I am asking u that what is the solution for this to me . Y wasting my money for this",1
"The Canon Inkjet Color Scanner Printer MG2577s is a small footprint device that has good quality prints on plain paper as well as Glossy Photo Paper. It is easy to work with and once installed it can be very useful in the home environment were the print load is low. Being a low cost printer one can't have many special functions, no complex controls which is an advantage for use by children and novices. It is a good product and has satisfactory performance for most common uses.",5
"Good home printer if you print less than 40 pages a month. The print quality is good. Not ideal for picture printing but you can live with it. Scanning, photocopying are also easy to get done when in need. Buy the XL size cartridge once the already included ones get over.",4
"Better to spend some more money on an ink tank printer.
It took only 20-25 prints on the ink cartridge which is come included with this product.
To buy a new one it costs over 700Rs. However compared to the ink tank printer, you do not have to face this kind of issue.",2
I like the printer more than I expected the cost of printer is less especially for black and white.Don't think that it is inkjet it takes more ink.black ink which is present already In catridge is less i.e it will exhaust fastly but once if you refill catridge properly then the ink will not get exhausted fastly,5
"This printer is delivered one month ago.

It is not in working condition due to toner not recognising . i requested an customer support through their portal.

after contacted cannon customer service intially they promised me support .

when no response after two weeks of customer support. they told me since person not available they will replace it with new piece asap.

now after 5 week their customer service does not pick up my phone or give me response.

i lost my money thats the only result.",1
"This is completely wastage of money. Don't buy, spend some more money and buy a good quality one. Printer cartridge can print only 20-25 print and cost of carritage is Rs 600. One print will cost you 30 per page .",1
"Black Cartridge light blinking (about to finish) after 2 color print & 1 Black & white print, also when I used it for photo print on a photo paper, ink was not so good and when I touched the photo color was removing on my finger, don't know paper quality is not good or ink is a low quality. raised the concern to Canon helpdesk awaiting the reply from them.",3
"All in one printer at this price, sounds impossible... I ordered it and found this great product it's exactly what I wanted, as I operate my small business from home, it's important for me to keep records of all documents physical as well as soft copy...
Prints well.
Scane well.
What els one need?
Worked well for me...",5
The thing with ink jet printer is that it is cheap to buy but expensive to maintain. The mechanicals of canon is just flawless but the price of cartridge is just equivalent to the price of printer itself. Thus by every refill you are just buying a nnew printer.,3
It's light and feels premium. Print quality is good for a printer in this price range. I got it in a good deal so happy with this product. If you are looking for a low cost printer then go for this one without any doubt. Only thing is the cartridges are little costly.,5
"The printer is very good at this price and also gives goot quality prints but the cartridge hardly works for 20 prints and then you have to buy a new one which probably costs around 600-800 that too for a small one so thats a big problem, so I suggest not to buy this printer just because of the cartridge that is used in it as it gets empty too soon and than buying a new cartridge every time will surely cause you a loss.",3
"It stopped working in 2 months, please don't buy, it's really not worth it.
The cartridge is extremely expensive and lasts for very little time. You per page cost will be Rs 10 which makes no sense, as the rate to print outside is cheaper.

Spend 2000 more and get a better printer, this is just a waste of money",1
"Please don't bye this type of inkjet (crtrage) printer
Because this is old technology printer this is good printer but after cartrage is over then we cant refill the ink because eny type of ink is not comparable for this printer after refilling ink the printer not gives good print and not clear. And we also can't repair thus type if printer. After refilling it gives half and blar print (use less print). I wasted my 2800rs please you dont waste it this is waste of money. If you have money to bay cartrage the you can use it.
So we should bye new type of printer like inktank printer or leaderjet printer this type of printer us best.",1
"Thank you amazon.Product is very good, its clear to all. But the ink cartidges can not able to give me more than 20 prints(both colour and black). Prints are really good quality but could be better than the reviews.
I request you all, if you want to print pdf or xerox purpose so it is better for that. Only home use, Not profational purpose.

Otg support is ok.
printer is easy to move.
Good looking.
But wires(usb and power cable) are to short , could be more long.
Ink refilling is ok. More than 60 times.

ভালো জিনিস , কিন্তু আরো প্রত্যাশা ছিল. আশা করি canon আরো ভালো করবে এই যন্ত্র টি কে।",5
"The printer make a lot of noise. Poor cadridge provided. Got over before I could take 20 Prints and Xerox together. Looks like a used printer or drained cadridges. No use in getting it in discount, cause you are going to spend more on Cadridges.",3
"Doing set up is not easy
And I don't see any customer support for setting up printer
I am trying since last 2 days to set up this printer..
I have called customer support then they told me that they will charge me for installation , another thing is that service number provided on packaging is not at reachable, amazon customer support provided my another number of service station
manual not provided detail regarding the scanning process",1
"While the printer per se is good it is very costly to maintain. With the small cartridge it gets over by the time one prints 100 sheets. Then one has to buy new cartridges (both 745 and 746) which cost almost 50% of the cost of the printer. If one refills the cartridge, the printer does not work. So every time one pays 50% of the printer cost. Wonder why refilling kits are being sold !!",1
"Recieved defective printer. As per your instruction,given for repair at Canon Authorized service center (Eureca Traders Shillong) sometimes on August 2017. I was informed they couldn't repair the printer and the saler is going to send new printer.But unfortunately no such thing has happen. Love to hear from you.",1
"Well I bought it after reading the mixed reviews but after using it for almost a month, I can easily say that it is the best product for home use at this price. Works pretty well. Gives dark prints and colors prints come bright too.",5
"DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER..THIS IS COST EFFICIENT WHILE BUYING.. BUT MAINTENANCE COST IS HIGH (AS COMPARED TO OTHER PRINTERS LIKE EPSON, HP) SMALL CARTRIDGE .. YOU HAVE TO REFILL FREQUENTLY BETTER BUY SOME INK TANK MODEL.. SMALL CARTRIDGE IS GIVING ONLY THIRTY FIVE PAGES.. ink cartridge goes empty very fast...SPEND SOME MORE 3000 BUY INK TANK MODEL THAT IS CONVENIENT & EASY TO USE ALSO..",1
"Received the product with scanner not in working condition. I had to get it exchanged from the company. Also, the black cartridge was defective and the company refused to change it.",2
"The printer is good from all side.
But the ink capacity is very low.
After printing 70 pages (B&W) and 50 pages (Colour) the cartridge will not run. You have to buy another cartidge. The cartridge is very very costly. You can't use this printer for business purposes. Think twice before buy.",2
This printer doesn't deserve single star also.only after 4 pages of printing it started giving blur image and den suddenly gave indication of dried ink.its really disappointing...Dont buy this products as no action was taken by Amazon and canon even after complaining also.,1
"Everyone Please note: this Printer is a defective model.
It will print but won't Scan.
This is the second Printer I ordered since 1st was defective but the second model was having same issue.
It Doesn't Scan.",1
"Littery worst product it's showing the low cost of printer but it's cartridge will over in 1 day and my cartridge also over in 1 day and color cartridge also in 1 ya half day, the Canon company given this product information is 1 black cartridge printing 100 page and 1color cartridge printing 70 pages but it's not true it's totally false black cartridge printing only 50 and color cartridge printing 30 or under 30 or Mera printer 1 week main hi damage hua or the suggestion is don't buy this product",1
"This printer is cheap in the first glance but can be expensive in the long run. It works fine, but refilling them is a headache. I tried injecting ink but didn't work. The cartridge price is too high. Now i'm just left with a useless printer and ink which is just occupying space in house. I suggest to put a little more money and get one that has tank visible outside, As in the long run it'll work more. Refilling of the carriage is very important and this problem should be addressed by canon.",1
"the printer seems to be very good for the price at first. but beware the cartridge is way too expensive. it costs more than printer (3300) for black and colour.
either buy a refill bottle and syringe for refill or don't even think about to buy it.
it's been 10 days, ink got over in around 36 pages.",1
"This product is not working after one month of use. After using for one month, it showed cartridges ink is over, after replacement of cartridge, it stopped printing. Complete waste of money. When I called customer care of Canon, they said this product work like this only and is poor, I am shocked with response received from Canon. No warranty this product in canon service center only show in .Will not recommend to anyone. I just want my money back or cannon/ Amazon should replace it.",1
"1. No Ink shown in day 1 and after some that it prints 4-5 page of black and 1 colour.
2. Bought ink and installed and given and print paper stuck in the middle of the printer
3. Now it is ideal and no use
4. Want to check is there a canon service centre at my location to fix this",2
Don't buy this printer ever. The ink cartridge costs rs1574 both the color and black and a new cartridge prints about 50 pages. Sad thing is it does not allow you to refill and use. Worst purchase ever.,1
"Once it runs out of ink which it did quickly, nightmare starts, ink cartridge is too costly and refill kits requires you to drill hole in cartridge which can’t be done without spl tools.
I calculated cost of print comes out around 7-8₹ per page. It’s a low priced product quality of prints are good but no economic if you print often.",1
"I bought it from amazon. its been more than 6 Months it is working fine. For printing specially for kid's school project (Normal Paper) and documentation, it is very good product. If you expect high quality print and high volume printing, then this is not recommended.",5
The product is pathetic. First time deliver product was faulty..not able to power on. After replacement of the product..now after 3 weeks printout is not coming properly. I am chasing different call center & service center no. I need the replacement of the product. Once of the service centre guy told me that cartridge comes along with product last only 15 days with very limited ink. I need to purchase new cartridge,1
"Canon MG 2577s is completely lowest quality. It is not only third or fourth quality but also fifth to …..infinitive. I demanded two times through Online and all time damaged to scan as well as photo copy. While installing, it gave error, it means the printer/scanner faulted. Secondly, there is no warranty on site on behalf of seller as well as the Canon company. You are requested to not purchase it otherwise you will lost your deep earnest valuable money.",1
"I bought this simply because this was in an offer and was available for cheap and I was finding it hard to get ink for my old hp printer..

Print quality is ok for documents..
But you can't print over 3-4 pages in a go,, then it fades off..

Paper feeding and paper getting stuck is a big issue..

Overall I would not recommend",1
"This printer has paper feed issues ( from the paper tray , the paper is just not being fed ) . There is no paper jam or any other jam etc. So i don't understand why the paper is not feed. Faced this issue within 2 months of purchase and the printer is hardly used ( about 10 pages printed , ever since bought). In Blore, they have just one service center & we have to carry the printer to the service center. Despite printer being in warranty there is no replace/repair service.",2
Nice and handy product .. does the work for you though the print cost may be a bit higher. Scanner is good but a bit slow and noisy. But that’s fine for the cost. Overall worth the cost nice product,4
This printer left us with nightmares as every time we need a print out it’s Softwares to be reinstalled. Then print out cones. After a GAO of 12 hours again printer need Softwares installation. Tired of it. We wanted to return this product. It’s leading to company’s website or toll free number,1
"The Printer Is Good Easy To Install But The Cost Of Printing Is Very High. The Cost Of Small Ink Cartridge Is Around Rs.600 To Rs.700 & It Bearly Gives You 20 To 30 Prints.
If You Do Not Use This Printer For 20 to 25 day's Then The Ink Tends To Dry & Refill Cartridge Is Not Supported.",1
"The scanner quality is very good. Considering the budget range at which this operates, it is a good buy. However, the ink cartridges run out quite often and the installation process is a bit lengthier than usual. Would definitely recommend buying this for those who do not print anything bulk. Colour ink quality is decent.",4
"Costly ink, should have made the printer costly and ink should be cheaper. A very wrong products selling concept. By selling cheap printer you are making recurring expenses higher, this is against ethics of business.",1
"Cartridge is low...I hardly printed 10pages with color n 5 black n white prints, it's showing cartridge is running low...print quality is also ok ok",2
Printer is best n even it's printing quality is good the problem is only with the cartridges both colour n black cartridges gets over very fast n on top they are too expensive to buy the cartridges don't ever give print of 50 pages n gets over after just 10 to 15 prints .I'm very disappointed with the cartridges this is my only problem if I would know about it before I would have prefer to buy a ink printer than a cartridges printers,3
"Worst printer...
I don't even use it for 4 days it shows red lights blinking..
If anybody wants to buy then plz check it once..
I hope my review will helpful to you....
One more thing is it's a cartridge printer so it's very expensive tooo... So you can buy ink tank printer even it's price is high....",2
Printer is average. For color printing it's use full. For black and white it's faded out. So I am not satisfied with black... For color it's rich and vibrant. Its good. I face a issue with amazon with this product. But amazon return my product and make a replacement. Thats a cool thing.,3
The price and product were a perfect fit. The colour print was great. I cannot comment on its 6 month usage. Its prints and scans well. However the install is slightly tricky. The packaging didnot look great - there was no seal.,4
Only 25 copies black and white copies could be printed in one catridge. Its price per copy is impossibly/extemely high. Pray the coustomers not to buy this printer. It is sheer looting. I am completely disappointed. Return policy is very bad. Rather ther is no return policy.,1
"Although it might look cheap while buying but beware the print cost is shockingly very high. I purchased this printer on 18 Aug and would have taken not more than 50-60 printouts, printer has started showing low ink and papers are getting half printed. The ink cartridge will cost me another Rs 500 which means I will pay double for prints if compared to a cafe. Bad bet!",3
"Super easy to use , good quality product . Installation process is quite simple has the ability to give prints from the scanner.

Cons

It drains a lot of ink while printing , so u need to make sure you keep the printed papers for drying atleast for 10 seconds..",3
"Not explored much, but based on initial useage, Printing speed & quality is good. Bit bulky, but not at all userfriendly software. I could not find how to scan the documents.",3
"Worst printer have never seen. Cartridge cost is more or less equivalent to the printer but production of the print is extremely low and bad. Waste of money.

Bought this. Unable to use. Later went to customer care. They changed the printer
Though no use. Very much upset. Need my cash back.",1
"Please don't buy this product, it stopped working in just two months. And there is no after sale service from Canon. I bought this for home usage for my daughter's assignments. But isn't working. The paper feeding roller doesn't feed any paper. Truly disappointed",1
Canon does not have suitable driver for macOS 10.15 (mac OS Big Sur ver 11.2) . It is advisable to check compatibility before placing order. You cannot refund this.,1
The printer needs to be reset from time and again as it stops working. The cartridge needs to be cleaned up as it causes ridges/marks while taking print outs. Auto cleaning system should be installed by manufacturers.,2
Waste .. always 7 leds will light up .. in just 90 prints of paper .. and cartridge is 650rs ... 650 rs for 90 print papers is a worst idea ... Buy printer where u will get tanks to fill in inks . .,1
"Defective Printer is send its not working in my computer. Driver CD, USB cable, and also one cartage is not read. its a request to dealer 1st check your item then send to the people.",1
"Purchasing second time, previous one PCB board failure after one and half year, warranty period over. So buy additional one year third party warranty. Good for lite usage like small office or home purpose. Cartridge rates are high, So Better Use ink refill at personal risk.",5
"Nice build quality, print quality, as per price. It is light weight printer, It is not recommended for commercial use, It is recommended to Home users those are use printer sometimes. Thank you cannon & Amazon for this product.",4
"Wate of money after 10 normal print outs it will not take any single page
I purchased it on 25 sept2017 and it give me last print on 5oct2017 after that it switch off",1
"Refill cost is ₹1900(colour and black).
Whereas printer cost is ₹2200.
Instead of purchase cartridge purchase new product. Remove cartridges sale back in olx will get ₹500 atleast.",1
"Excellent product for home uses like children home work as well as emergency print out for own requirements at home.
One point solution. For photocopy , scan, printout etc",5
I would like to share my review on this product. After printing 20 pages the printer is running shot of ink. How would that happen when i just printed the question bank of my daughter which is only 25 pages? Either they should have given used cartridge's or the half filled catridge. Ultimately I have been fooled on this. i dont recommend this product to the retailer.,1
I got the printer it worked for about 50 pages prints with existing cartridge and after that had to install new cartridge now the printer is accepting one colour cartridge and not black and white. I don't know what is the problem its the same as whats showin in the product,4
Worst product I have bought till date from Amazon. Cheap printer hardly print 30 page n ink is over. One need to order a new cartridge for 1200. The way they fool people is awesome. ...,1
Printer is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very good👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,5
"Better not to buy this product , go for higher end printer which comes with CIS . Xerox quality is low, print quality is good , cartridges ran out after 15-20 pages print and also if you refill them you gonna have a lot of problems with the printer . Cartridges cost is very high .
My suggestion don't buy it.",1
Came to know when I called Customer Care for some help that 'there is no online service available for this model & we need to take the printer to near by service center'. It would have been good if they add this point in the Product Details list. When we know that there is no online service available we would not have opted for this model.,2
"Less than a year of use and it has now completely stopped working. Extremely poor quality product
In addition, it's an ink guzzler. A few prints and you'll need to replace the cartridge. So don't be deceived by the lower price of the printer. They'll more than make it up by the millions of cartridges you'll have to buy",1
"Good to buy, strictly if you have very little prints to make may be 30-50 a month. Otherwise buy laser jet, as cartridges cost you a lot. One black small cartridge will cost you approx 700/- for less than 100 prints. Rest you can do the maths.",4
"Print quality was outstanding. Excellent.
But only we can get minimum prints per cartridge. If you want more prints for example 1000 per month better go for higher versions of this.",5
"This all-in one printer and scanner does not come with any drivers. Did not work with Mac Book Pro. With a PC after a lot of research and downloading drivers, the printer worked, but the scanner would not work. I have been trying to replace the item the amazon.in does not accept a replacement or refund. Worst possible experience.",1
"Easy to Install. Print Quality is Okay for this Price. I Bought at Rs.2899, but Cartridge Price is very Costly. Colour Print is Very Good.
But Printer Ink Cartridge is Very Costly. Go to Epson Printer it's Economical.",2
It’s waste of money and time both the company is not providing any kind of service to customers and the installation is the worst part of product i had tried almost 10 time but it’s not getting connection to desktop and I connected customer care they asked me paid installing charges what a nice way of service providing company,1
"hi my name is govind and i have buy this procuct on (canon pixma mg2577s)2-oct-2019 and im using this printer today means 30-12-2019 and cartages are not working , and showing color cartage is emty , pls refill and use and im buy ink
and try to refill then i refill again its showing emty. what can i do ????",1
Very disappointed with installation process. The printer did not not get installed inspite of repeated attempts using both supplied CD and online download of drivers. Kept giving message that printer is not connected. I had to arrange paid visit ( Rs 400/-) of Cannon Support for installation. Installation support for this model is not free.,2
Its value for.money. lightweight. Colour print quality is avaerage ( cant expect more from inkjet printer). Back n white is good which was my main requirement. Easy to operate. Ppr exit tray is bit small.,4
Good printer for occasional house use. Satisfactory print quality as well. Only problem is number of prints per cartridge. It is very very less that what is claimed in the description.,3
"The description said that if we give a print command, the printer will sense and switch on automatically. This does not happen. Otherwise, everything is okay today - the first day!!",3
Pic quality is great. Print quality is perfect. Just plug and play. Great product. I have used it for two months occasionally. The ink hasn't dried up. Great for home use when printing and copying is done occasionally.,5
"Never buy this printer, it's ink cartage is too costly like around 600-700 and one cartage can print max 30-40 papers only and even refilling ink in those cartages are also not possible believe me i regretted after useing this printer for a month, don't be like me.. 😅",1
Cartridges have to be installed everytime and its not mentioned anywhere and also confirmed by customer care. 3000 rs printer and printing costs for upto 700 (cost of cartridge) for every approx 100 pages. Even CISS is not supported by the service center.,1
This review is not about the product. It is about the service provided by Amazon. There is no cooperation brought by the service about any issue. The customer does not get a clear support.,2
"The print works good.The print and picture quality were also good and superb.But the catridge didnt even lasts for 3days.. Took only 30pages,but shows black ink catridge is below the level.",4
"Amazing product for household purposes , but it's cartilage give 100 pages of print then you have to refill again , amazing print quality, easy to use and setup is very easy , best selling price , wonderful packing. Print , scan , copy by both android phone or computer",5
"Looking for a product within budget, this could serve the purpose. Can be used for school and college works. As the ink provided, quality isn't so good, but okay.",4
"Totally unHappy with scanning .Scanning stopped after scanning for 3-days( from date of purchase) and about 15 pages. (Home use). Re-installed software print OK .But No scanning !!!.See above messages.
Drivers loaded from CD as well as on line .Iwant to return & claim refund .Amount of time I have wasted is enomorus",1
The ink level is so low that hardly 10 pages were printed. And most amazing part is scanner does not work in case the ink is not available. fooling people to buy expensive cartilage for scanning???,1
"Cannon painter is too good and purely value for money. Great product, so far no difficulty in using, easy to use, easy to install.",5
Printer is very good. The printing quality is also nice. It was not that hard to install. I was pretty scared as the old reviwes were not good but my printer turned out just fine! Make sure to put the ink cartage correctly and you can watch a youtube video on how to install it. It was more than worth it for the price!!!,5
"Very good product for domestic purpose in affordable price but ink supplied with is very less quantity, only 26 papers print carried out. And new ink cartridge are very expensive, ऊंट से ज्यादा नथ महँगी है.",3
"this is utter garbage. one should certainly go for hp because repairing an hp printer in india is a breeze. the logic board of this printer got screwed up within a year. canon reportedly wants a whooping sum of 2.8 k to get it replaced , which is 200 bucks more than the mrp of this printer.",1
All are excellent but the supplied cartridges prints hardly 25 copies. Don't know whether the new cartridges are same or not.,5
"Only demo cartridge attached, this cartridges only 10 pages printed(both black and colour) . Otherwise new cartridge purchase and use it.",3
"The ink cartridge is very small it barely prints 25-30 pages per cartridge, and cartridge is very costly so it's better to look for printers with good cartridge. otherwise print quality is great and printer is great but overall running cost is very high.",1
"Refill is really costly ..., It costing 2000 just 1200 less than printer and refill

It's better to buy new printer than refill",2
"This product is good but cottage is not good ,
And this company do not responsible for cottage and request you to please do not purchase this type of product ,",5
The printer gave me a total of 46 pages of black and white 2% ink was used as it was only written documents. Not worth the buy has the cartridge cost is very high it cost me approx 14 Rs per page. Unreasonable printer. Would recommend going for inkjet printers.,1
"I'm deeply disappointed
They have sent me a used one!
As on the photo, the outer box was re-taped and even the ink case was open when arrived. I really cannot understand this.",1
"Got a defective piece.As soon as I got the printer and turned it on, the yellow light started blinking and I had to call the service center and they told scanner is defective the error code - 5100 . They informed me that scanner is defective maybe because of manufacturing or due to delivery.",1
"Amazon i would like to tell you that, after reciveing the printer we installaed the software. But still it having problem at installation. Thinking that printer problem. So i asked for returning. But after removed installation and reinstallled.now it is working well. Hence i dont want to return the product",5
Obsolete product - Could not set it up after 4 hours and trying with both windows and Mac laptops. Returning it,1
"it have totally three buttons on the top left of the printer. it is on/ off , black print button and the colour print button, installation is easy but care fully handle all parts of the printer. it have two ink tank one is black and the another one is colour, it is use and throw type. we cannot refill it. lees wight so no strength easily brittle it. all open close arrangement are in loose connection. it is useful for home purpose only, never set others including small company.",3
"While the print quality is ok, we cannot print more. I could print about 30 sheets (colour+BW) with the cartridges that came with the printer. Too bad.",3
This printer is not completing installation. Printer is not getting detected while installing. Seller is also fraud who said cannot be replaced so this means seller knew this product is faulty.,1
"Nice product, easy to use , good quality print. But the cartridge ink quality is less max 200 pages i have printed then the ink was empty. I have request every one to buy additional ink refill kit to use more time . I am also use refill kit for last 16 months it very useful. Quality of print is good .",4
"Very good product. Value for money,easy to handle and good quality print. Performance is very good. Scanning and copying is also seemless.",5
Installation & demo should have been done by authorized cannon personnel. You did not provide it. Installation by a novice without service personnel is not desirable.,5
The overall use of the product is nice for the price i bought it. But i think the number of prints with each cartridges is less.,4
Got only 60-page print. It's a total waste of money. Don't buy this product. its cartridge ( low yield ) cost 600-800.,1
very poor quality very poor product...and also very poor services of canon and amazon..My printer not working after one month so i riffill my cotage but it not work i talk with cannon center they can't give me any warranty and says u riffill ur cotage so ur warranty expire.,1
"Good product. Even though the initial product came with a dead on arrival thing, amazon quickly replaced the defective product in quickest time. Happy the new one is working well and amazed on the quality of canon product. Thanks",5
We all buy this printer as we think that it is at nominal price for household use and for children's worksheet....but we all befooled by company as ink of the printer is over expensive....the ink which comes along with printer is almost empty and hardly gives 20-30 copies. I m very disappointed.,2
"Reasonably good product but undoubtedly printing cost is high. Multi tasker for scanning, photo copy and printing all in one. Scanning is real good.",4
"ERROR 5011,DEFECTIVE PRODUCTt,no AMAZON PACKING ,no prior Quality checking for Canon Products leading to Faulty products so dont waste ur money im trying for replacement its like luck or say lottery u may get a good one but not everyone is lucky...with Canon",1
"That printer is not working at all
It’s tough for me to do installation the driver and I am too much disappointed
As this was an urgent situation for me to need that and I suffered a lot kindly cancel the order or replace that one
Thanks and Regards
Santosh hudda",1
"Good product, scanning is clear, print quality nice, photocopy is also good, overall awesome and also you can refill the cartridges by draining holes in it.",5
"Not bad for the price is all I wanna say. For someone occasionally needing basic printouts, it’s good.",4
"Its a waste as not even 25 to 25 copies were taken already Black Inc is over. Please dont recomend such useless model.

No technical person called after your Sales to check how we have installed.So we can buy from Market as they install free of cost and explain how to",1
Not repairable if damaged. If warranty then company replaces the whole product. If out of warranty then you can't repair you have to get new one. Local shop or companies can't repair as the parts are not available in India.,3
Cartage Not working after printing 10 to 15 pages need assistant of Cannon technical support my work is suffering. Please contact me ASAP.,1
"The cartridge that came with the printer got drained of ink pretty quickly and left us with no option than going for a new pair of black and color.

Price per page looks much higher than anything practical/useful.

Copy and scan functions work properly.",4
It's ok product. It's photo copy quality is also ok not good. It cartages become empty early. It seems that it was half field.,3
"The print quality is average and works fine for daily use prints.Overall ,in this price range this is the cheapest and best printer for average users like students.",5
Very bad experience I don't like and I only 2page print and black ink is finished don't by any one pls highlights,1
"WEST OF MONEY Because of when one time u refil catriedge that time he have error catridge not loading

an customer care say that U will purches NEW ctridge an MOST IMPORTANT ctridge PRICE OF BLACK AN COLOR 1200RS",1
"1st got a defective product but was replaced promptly by Amazon in 3-4 days..
Good product..
Cartridge with product got over very soon...",4
"Very expensive for printing. Black - approximately rs.5+, colour - rs.15+.
Better copy file to a pen drive and go to nearby Xerox shop and take printout for 2rs&10rs
Machine is cheaper, but outcome costly.",1
"i HAD ORDERED FOR NEW CARTAGE. THIS IS COMING HALF FILLED.
EXTREMELY COSTLY.
SHOULD REDUCE THE PRICE BY INCREASING THE TURN OVER.
IF YOU ORDER CARTAGE THREE TIME IT AS GOOD AS MACHINE VALUE.
VERY SENSITIVE MACHINE.",1
"The product says the carriage capacity is 100 prints, but it is barely 30 prints.
The printing cost is about rs 30, whereas in description it's mentioned rs7 for black and white prints.
Paper gets stuck a lot of times in the machine.",1
Good product. All ink jet printers are good in quality. Not said print quantity with the attached cartridge. Value for money.,3
"it is working excellant, i will advise anybody to purchase, but ink will complete early we should again refill the inkjet otherwise it wont works.",4
"software not installed successfully, and printing gone wrong without application. what should i do?. i tried from different sites and cannon site too for software.",3
"Good compact, light weight, easy to use printer. Ink will finish quickly after 1 or 2 months if you use it frequently.",4
"Cartridge runs empty very soon...
Not even printed 50 pages with black one & less than 10 with colour one ..",3
Good easy to use in this budget. Prints normal as well as glossy papers as well. Packaging is not that great by amazon but product was okay.,5
This copier at this price I can say its a throw away price. Its a fantastic product for home use. Could not expect anything better.,5
Everything is just awesome in this price range but the problem is with cartridge because after refill 2times in black and white cartridge the printer stops printing perfectly.we have too spend money on cartridge which is 800rs in market,4
"Not useful for printout.
For Scanning purpose ok.
Drinks lot of ink.
10Rs per copy.
Only advantage is Scanner",2
"Good printer, lightweight, good scan and print , though it's makes a lot of noise while using like a old typewriter",4
This cartridge life is less than 20 pages. My cartridge with normal documents of 20 pages asking for new cartridge. Don't buy this unless you want use as Scanner. Buy Laser or tank printer. This is not worth for money unless they provide extra refills along with printer.,2
"Good printer for home use purpose. Easy to install and manage. Print, scan and copy...all basic three features fulfill the requirement.",5
"It's really good product and it's colour is better, the printing quality is really very good and fast. At the first day I thought that it will not be a good product but it proved me wrong and it was proved that amazon is really a good e-commerce marketing platform.",4
"My canon pixma mg2577s is easy to use and easy installation.
I have used about one month satisfactorily
but
now the product is not working, I'm not able to take any print
So I want to help from your side.
What will I do?
Plz help me...",2
"Not recommended. So many problems associated like installation failure , error when trying to print , paper stuck, and most importantly ink cartridges get empty fast like for 5 colour prints and five black.
Cartridge is costly. You can't take many prints at a time.",1
"Print quality is good . But the cartiges Arre very low. After pring 7-10 pages the black cartidge light is blinking and shows empty. Over all good printer in 2899/- rupees .
Please tell me best ink for this printer under 500 to refill it's cartidge please.",5
Took three prints and black cartrage is over. Scanning and photocopy quality is pathetic. Pls don't waste money. Once refilled only 10 pages and light for black ink again gives indication of being dried. Amazon should not sell this product.,1
"The device driver software isn't the proper one which suits for the MG2577S ,
DO THE NEEDFUL",1
Worst product. Not even the product turning on and even Canon customer care providing service. They are asking to take the product to a service centre. What is the point of buying online. Worst after sales service. Don't buy this.,1
Got Faulty Piece. Printer is not working at all. And there is no Return or exchange policy. Really not expected this from amazon. Please look after this.,1
"Installation is easy. Print quality is also good. I was not confident to buy this as I saw many negative reviews for this product, but this product is great.",4
"2000 K aas pas copy nikalte hi service mode me chala jata he. Or Ic kharab ho jata he.
Ekdam waste products.
Please do not buy cannon pixma mg 2500 series printers..
Mene Pehle bhi cannon pixma mg 2570s liya tha same problem hota he.",1
"Its a wastage of money. Being a regular customer of Amazon.in, i would request Amazon plsss don't make fool of your loyal customers like us by selling such a bad product and bad company. Its a waste of my money Nd energy. Amazon pls stop selling canon printer.",1
"A very decent product.. Nice print quality.
Easy to use it's bundle software. Scanner, photocopy functions running smoothly. Initial cost is very low but running and maintenance cost is high af!! For official purpose is not recommended.. Good for personal use!!👍👍",5
"Cartridge problem after printing few pages, not recommended for medium used.",2
Product is easy to use. But printer cartridges runs out of ink very fast. I believe small black cartridge got over in just 25-30 pages or may be less. Very surprising.,3
They sent defective piece but after replacemnt working fine.good quality,5
The connectivity to mac book pro is very slow the print command has to be given many times and it still showns not connected,1
"Looking so good
Working good but speed very slow
Best for this price ,useful for child school projects",4
"THE PRINTER IS VERY GOOD PRINT QUALITY IS COMMENDABLE
BUT THE THING THAT STRIKES IS THE COST OF INK REFILL
IT COSTS AROUND 650/- FOR ONE CARTILAGE THAT LASTS ONLY FOR 60-65 PRINTS IN DRAFT QUALITY
BUY A COSTIER PRINTER WHICH MAY HELP YOU TO SAVE INK IN A LONG RUN",1
This is total waste of money and time. Amazons policy for this oroduct is very biased. I was very impressed with amazon till this. After this printer and their no refund policy I came to know truth. Please don't buy this product or any similiar product with amazon.,1
"Good product. Good for home use. Kids project, flight ticket print out etc. Not advisable for business purposes.",4

"Printer has bring my per print cost upto Rs 25.
As and when we re install new cartridge there is a need to set a print alignment in printer which takes up 2-3 pages.
Also after that only 20 pages are carry out with the new cartridge
After that it shows orange blinking.",3
"Printer is nice but the cartridges r expensive..... chaar Aane ki murgi, baarah Aane ka masala",1
Looks like they have sent a degect piece. Couldn't even use single time. It's showing hardware problem when I tried to install. Because of corona couldn't call any technician to home for help. Highly unsatisfied.,1
"Product I received was showing error code 5011 and had damage on body.
I ordered for replacement. Replacement was done within 4 days with same error.
More over, Service centres are rejecting printers ordered from Amazon.",1
Purchased on knowing that ink is refillable. But this is non refillable and hence a hopeless item.,1
Nice product and nice printing quality and very easy to install as well as very easy to use,5
Scan error. After replacement I received device and it’s work perfect.,4
So far gud however the cartridge was not full. It is only 80% filled according to the application that shows.,4
"INK CARTIEDGE PROVIDED WITH THE PRINTER, I AM HARDLY TAKE 10 -15 COLOUR PRINT OUTS, AND ALMOST NT MORE THAT 20BLACK ZEROX, CARTEDGE RAN OUT OF INK, TERRIBLE......PLEASE DO ENQUIRY WHETHER I HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH USED CARTIEDGE OR NOT?",3
"No support for installation of driver. Problem of printer head alignment came after purchase and starting, so asked for first installation help to customer care, but they are charging payment which is high. Printer not started so return.",1
"print and picture quality are good and the work properly print, scan, and copy but it was very high ink consuming only print 20-25 pages and the link was finish and the ink cartiger cost is very high so it is very expensive and per page print cost up 25 Rs.",1
The print comes very slowly and after 3 to 5 print the print start coming blurry and having issues with print. The cartridge is also very expensive and after 50 to 100 pages of print you have to buy new cartridge which is very expensive,3
"Choose just best one.
Installation little bit difficult.",4
"It’s poor and cheap printer,Ink will get empty with in 10prints.Lot of Noise and very slow printer.

It’s simply waste of money , Please don’t buy this and don’t waste your money",1

It was really best deal.",5

"Most Amazing multi purpose print at this price band, actually at this price what else u expect. The product is surplus only according to the price offered.",5
"Price of the printer may be less, but ink cost is high for refilling the Ink. Check the ink price once before buying the product.

Ink price will be 600 to 700 and we can print maximum of 80 to 100 pages only",1
Print quality could have been better. It is not also able to print half of the claimed paper from the recommended cartridge. Good for occasional use. Not worth the money spent.,3
"Only about 20 pages printed in black ink, so you will have to spend a lot of money for ink and printing. So spend a little more to buy a better printer of more capacity.",1
Product overall is easy to use and handle. Print too is good but not great. Does the job. However the cartridges are different story. Cartridges cost the same as the printer it self.,3
"the black colour ink cartrige given by you along with the printer is not good. i could hardly print 10 sheets and the
ink got over and the print quality became lighter. any chance of getting free replacement ???",3
"The product is value for money. The first delivery was a defective piece, but amazon replaced it within 2 days. Over all satisfied with this for home and small office purpose. I will update my review after few months of usage.",4
Very nice product ..... Good print .... Good price .... Easy to use,4
thanks to super speed delivery by amazon ...this printer is just starting range one and print quality is good but .main drawback is price of cartridge is very high and few prints only it gives ..,1

Basic printer. But some issue in the wifi printing,5
"Product packaging is good, except this all the things are below average. Product quality is very poor even the cartridge is usable to print upto 30 prints. Which may cost you Rs. 20 per print. Don't buy it. Worthless body quality.",1
Best in this budget but I believe it's outdated one....can't find it's software on net,5
Paper feeding quite tough. Sometimes irritatable. More cartridge consuming through which feels more expensive. Have to think before buying...,5
Bought a canon printer from amazon on 22/10/2019. Now it doesn't work anymore. I will benefit if you can arrange a warrenty bill.,5
"Value for money

"Worst printer by canon
B&W print is available @3 rupees in market while this printer is providing B&W print @27 rupees
Never buy it
Not smart shopping",1
Buying only is waste because buying an extra ink is more costly and it prints less pages and ink gets over fastly,2
Not for heavy use. Ink is finishing immediately. Every time you have to refill. Black Cartridge is Not a good quality. No Print properly after refilling.,3
Very very expensive printer only 20 to 25 prints black cartridge and 6 to 7 colour cartridges were empty total waste of money hai ye don't buy onyone this product,1

The product seemed fine but unfortunately want even able to be detected by the pc for installation. Waited for like hours for installation but never did it complete it. Would be better if the matter is looked into.,1
It gives good quality prints . However cartridges do not last very long.,5
"Needs lot of maintenance. Very costly cartridge. Bad printing quality after 2 to 4 minutes of printing. Not at all value for money.
Scanner works well.",2
Print quality is not as good... tho the printer is cheap...and the cartridge finished in hardly 50 odd pages...It would be better to spend double and buy a more advanced one,2
Bogus item. At this price hp is 20000 times better,2
"Strongly recommend not to buy this cannon MG 2577S printer. It drains out ink in no time, every on, off , it drains ink. I printed two pages and ink finished. Bad experience.",1
This is a personal printer and so fits into a low budget. Plug and Play its working well,5
"This printer cartridge is very expressive
IAM very disappointed to buy this product",1
"Good printer
But of you want a long term printer then go to inkjet printers. Otherwise it's better.
Also for refill the cartiage use a best quality ink.",5
Printer is decent for this pricerange. Multipage scan can be time consuming.,4
its a waste of money . the black cartridge stopped printing after 30 pages. new cartridge is very costly and refilling it creates a lot of mess. my advice would be to go for Laser printer .,1
"Printer arrived dead on arrival. By the time I got to install it, the return window had passed. Now I am busy calling Canon and trying to get it fixed. Not a good experience for a brand new product.",1
"It's not the best product. The print quality is okay but filling the ink tonner is a cumbersome job. New tonner cost is high so can't go for it.

Worst investment. Can't return also.",1
Gave it to the beneficiary a school and till now no complaint,4
With in one week black ink finished only takes 5 to 10 print and the new ink rate is near to new printer (black and colour) if you have little more budget go for laser printer,1
"Good print quality, packaging was top. Thanx to amazon for its due service.",5

"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Easy to print, scan and to create a photocopy of a document. Most utilized products in an office or home. Good product at an affordable price. Here's my product video of Canon Pixma MG2577S taking a print. We spoke Canon customer service and were told that Canon provided demo cartridges for printing with this printer. These cartridges might last for 50-60 prints including color, black. They suggested us to new cartridges of Small or Medium or XL. Insisted us not to use the refilled cartridges",5
"Worst printer
Cons- i got only 25 pages by new cartridge and after that ink was finished.
Try many times to refill and open its nozzle with succession tool but their cartridge is also wrost, poor quality of product, don't buy and go for other option",1
"The printer is good,,, but not the packaging and the box .. the box is damaged and it's not protected as well like outer box which is usually of an amazon,, the seller only wrapped a single polythene cover....& there's a hole on the box but thankful that the printer is good...
It prints very nice and fast both colour and monochrome...
It produces some noise but that's not louder.....
I don't know about the capacity of cartridges...but carefull when installation of cartridges!!!!
Overall it printed good and well....
Price drop on Indian sale..., from 2699 to 2299???!😖😟😞 That's why i hate to buy electronics products on regular price...on regular days!!!",4
"I have been using this printer-scanner-copier for two years now. My conclusion is that this is not a great machine. Cannon printers are generally slow. Over two years, this machine has been very slow. Now it takes three minutes to scan one A4 size sheet. It is very frustrating that I am often stuck for 30 minutes for scanning a 10-page document. The ink cartridges too are inefficient, apart from being very expensive. The original black and color ink cartridges that came with the machine gave a total output of 86 sheets. Then I purchased a set of original black and color ink cartridges that gave me an output of 80 sheets and so on. I do not recommend this printer. My original review published two years ago is retained below. 01 DEC 2020
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I purchased it just four days ago and, printed 35 pages in the past four days. So far so good but, it is too early to write a credible review at this time. However, the print quality is not great. Especially, the black print is not bright and, more serious, while on the 30th page, the printer started blinking for the black cartridge, indicating the black print cartridge is ending. So, the print per page is very expensive - more expensive than advertised. Additional original cartridges are expensive (approximately Rs. 1300 for the color and black/white pair on Amazon.in), but cheaper than those for HP and other printers.",1
This is my first printer for home use and I am totally satisfied with the performance. I already took out 80 pages print including color and black and white. And it’s still going on. I got it in 2200 rs which is a great thing about this print. I would recommend it if you want to buy for your home use and want a great quality of printing. Thank you amazon for bringing this deal to me.,5
"Best inkjet printr below 2000 Rs
If u Refill n use this free catridge u can take more then 500 page ( black)",5
"Never buy this printer, cost of printer is very very less but when you go to buy the refill it will cost you almost INR 2000 and you can take print for only 250 to 300 pages only.
And the biggest problem is that you have to compulsory buy both the ink cartridges colour and black & white, otherwise it will not work...",1
"With is 3 month its not working last month i only i have replace my cartridge now i am facing problem
i have gone to service center they are saying you have buy again cartridge and give new invoice and printer invoice then company will replace the product,i am disappointed with the product and band i have spend double money in cartridge then the printer",1
Cant print..The error light and the black ink light keeps blinking for 16 times. Dont know what happened to my printer. I bought it on 18 may 2017.,1
"I've ordered two of these, one at home and one at office. They work fine. Expect normal printing and it is not for commercial usage at all. The print quality is nice. I purchase a new cartridge Everytime as I can't keep going to the print shop and waste time.
Ordering a 3rd one now. Second for my office. It's decent and I'll recommend it for basic use, letter heads related prints, assignments, invoices etc.",4
"Purchased this product on 17th January 2017. The printer giving error 5B00 and became totally inactive on 4th April 2018.The authorized service centre refused repair on the plea of warranty expired.
I need on site extended warranty for one or two years on this printer. Is it possible now ? whats the price and further procedure for onsite extended warranty. Pl. reply at

"Good quality printing of say stamp size photos on glossy paper as well. Also can print direct from smart phone using an otg adapter and usb printer app. Printer price low but cartridge price is high so printer useful for occasional printing purposes only. However, after printing 50 pages or so ink consumption is less.",3
"Very good printer.good for office and household use.clear HD print quality.i am giving 4 star because the ink got over within days.But i think no problem because the ink can be refilled by watching videos in YouTube.its little tricky.Overall it is showing good performance.u can buy it without thinking.it is also having the facility of scanning and photocopying.Time delivery and good packaging...
.........
THANKS AMAZON AND CANON.........",4
"Budget- economical
Look - very nice
Weight- light weight
Print quality- 8marks out of 10
Cartridge included- demo, it will print only 15-20pages.
If you want your printing economical then use ink refilling technique(on youtube) in the existing cartride. Product is good for personal use. Use once a week to avoid dry cartridge. You can scan print copy in seconds, easy to use. 1star deducted for canon for their costly new cartridges. Go for prodot or gocolour ink and learn to refill on youtube and enjoy seamless printing.",4
"Good All in one !! Two main issues. (1) Cartridge becomes empty very fast !! (2) The Software is not very intuitive. It takes a little time to figure out, unlike HP all in ones' which are very easy to use. Scanner and print quality is good.",3
If you want printer which have sharp printing in low cost the then go for it. It comes with inbuilt scanner which can be used for scanning or coping. This printer also support photographic glossy paper which print sharp and clear photos. There is only one conc. that the cartilage is little bit costly. It can be refilled but better to use canon ink. You have to print at least once in a week to avoid the dryness of ink. The printer is good and ideal for home use. Packing is also good and product is delivered very fast. Good service from Amazon.,5
believe me. never buy canon product. printer is low cost but cartilage is very very hisg cost. you can only print approx 40 page per refil/cartilage. search on net before buy it.,2
Its a worst product to buy. i will not suggest to anyone to get this. its ink is too costly. and you cannot proper refill from.outside. its having lots of problem in nozzel. i wasted my money and time.,1
The black cartridge keeps drying of after few prints. Need to keep replacing cartridge which comes at a very high cost about Rs 700 so the idea to buy a all in one printer at a very low cost backfired in this case,1
Printer is fine and as expected but the color cartridge exhausted just after 10 prints. I think now realized that using this product is very much expensive.,2
Excellent printer for the price...,5
"Tooo much Noise this item
&
Cartridges each one Equals to printer cost
S*** I lost my money waste product , I'm just using scanning purpose only :-(",2
"the colored prints had stripes, I assume because the shelf life of cartridges must be over. Later I also realized that the printer is not value for money as the number of prints you can take is digitally counted from the cartridge chip and EPROM on the printer mother board. So it will not allow you to refill the same cartridges (or even let you print even if there is actually ink left in the cartridge). The cartridge themselves are so overpriced that it is better that you buy an ink-tank printer itself.",1
"Its inkjet so it consumes ink very much faster than the laser jet printers. This product stops working and shows error light if anyone ink is missing, so u can't use it with just black ink. I guess even scanner stops working if there is no ink. So be careful and don't throw the used up ink rather keep it in the printer.
Scan quality is superb and print quality is more than the average. Again ink gets used up fast.
If you want to use the printer regularly then go for laserjet because it will save you lot of money in long run.
Also the ink dries up if you don't use of weeks, that does not happen in laserjet printers.
I bought because I only wanted a scanner and for 1900rs it was the cheapest scanner available. BTW scan size maximum is A4.",3
It is good in price but when I bought this from Amazon so after purchasing this man I test this printer Canon pixma so the printout comes with gap lining and also the ink that was printed on the paper is not good so in my opinion don't buy this it is worst,2
"i have brought this printer for my children's academic purpose. its really best printer. simple, easy installation and operation.",4
"i have been given dublicate and blank cartiage it didnt given 50 prints also it is showing ink finish , really disappointed company like cannon is doing all these fraud",1
"Photo printing is an issue as I select printing photo on glossy photo paper it says select different configuration. Else it's good but I bought it for photo printing and that's not working so I'm disappointed. Ink consumption is too high and you can not refill cartridge as printer driver director sets no print if refill is empty it consider ink cartridges empty, thus no more printing. Sad.",2
"This printer didn't even work for one time. The yellow light is blinking all the time. And in computer its showing support code 2011.
Dont buy canon printer. This issue is common for all canon printers. When i contacted service center they told the scanner is damaged. thats the reason.
Also the delivery package was too bad and careless.
Very bad experience for me.",1
"This is my best printer and ever since we switched from HP to Cannon 4 years ago, I have no regrets. We use three of these printers in our office. Two with CISS and one with refilling. With CISS cartridges last 1 to 1.5 years. With refilling 2 to 6 months. Printers last 1-2 years after which we just dump it. We are not so specific about colors. We print invoices, address labels, record sheets, company documents etc. The space between the Catridge and the plastic case is so narrow for CISS tube, that we found that unscrewing and lifting the top plastic cover housing the scanner module is the best way for reliably installing the CISS. I understand all the negative experience faced by users, but timely refilling may help you get the best of the printer. If you take the risk then believe me you can reap benefits, because the printer's life is commendable from our experience.",5
"I Received This Printer Very Fast In Perfact Seal Pack Condition With Demo Cartridges Its A Multifunction Printer Photocopy Scanning , Color Print ,Blank N White Print All Working Fine I M Happy With It",5
"Worked ok for 1 year and 3 days. As soon as warranty expires, so does the printer!
Also: 1. Extremely noisy... paper eject and paper load sound like a major train collision 2. On-line manual is very very difficult to understand. It is mostly in Chinese English and instructions are not clear at all.",3
"For the price, I am loving it. It can print, scan & copy in colour. That's great. However, without correct driver, the results are not good and finding a correct driver for Linux was headache.",5
"cartridge is poor quality , as per information it will print 100 black and 100 color pages , but now just printed 4 black and 1 color print.
So make sure buying time demo cartridge .",1
"I bought it's older model mg2570. Initial cost is very low but it become too costly later on...it's cartridge which come with the printer is not refillable.....market cost of refillable cartridge is around 1000.....so do the math....what ever the cost of printer is add cost of 1000 because you have to buy new cartridge when 1st got empty........then again these cartridge got clogged if you don't use printer regularly.....
After a fix number of print I think around 3000 printer start showing error 5b00....to resolve this error you have to change a chip which is not available in India...so around after 3000 prints your printer become useless.....",2
"Good Print Quality, but can't refill the cartridges (Black n Colour).
The Cartridges are too costly to buy and definitely not a cost effective printer.",2
"one of the worst products, though the printer is good u cant afford for the cartridge, each cartridge will cost u around 600-700 and can print a max of 30-40 A4 sheets thats all.... better opt other printers... if interested to buy this product then reply on this comment ill give my current printer for half the price..",2
"I am happy with this product but it's ink is too costly. I have this printer but whenever i need a photo copy of a particular document.
That time i have to think like should i have make a photo copy from this printer or from a market because that ink is too costly.",4
It is a good and easy to use printer ink cartridges are easily refillable.,4
Packing is very bad..... But printer is working fine.....no problem till today,4
"Dont buy it. It only look cheap offer. The ink does not last more than few print. The cartilage cannot be refilled, and you need to buy new and its as expensive as printer. The ink gets dry soon. Scanning does not work if printer does not have ink. Overall I feel cheated by the buyer. Dont waste your money on this buyer. Always buy from shop and you get better support.",1
"Its a basic printer, a little slow, but thats on me I did not read the specs well before ordering. Its better if you spent little more and go for something with wireless connectivity.
update review for cartridge, very expensive and last very less time, specially the one which comes with printer hardly lasted for 20 pages.",1
"If you just look for a printer to print school worksheet and xerox needs, go for it. Please remember the quality of inkjet is not what you get from a laser jet. Affordable and quick + easy to install & use.",4
It doesn't print the bottom margins of a4 paper,2
"Hi i am a buyer of this printer . I really love this product because it is very cheap, easy to use , printer + scanner + Xerox all is here . But ink cartridge is small , I think it contains 8 to 10 ml ink so it can prints 150 pages with a full cartridge.
One thing I want to say that when Amazon gave me this product it's cartridge has likely 5ml ink either it can contain 10 ml ink .",5
"The printer is good for home usage and doesn't cost much..
The cartridge supplied is very small and will require refill very soon.
But considering the price it's fine is guess..U get a scanner copier and printer ..
I bought refill ink and it's easy to refill ink.
Cons
The printer is slow
Print quality is not very good ..But okay for home usage and regular print jobs",4
"Ink hogger. I printed around 50 pages on the cartridge that was given with the printer.

This is really an emergency printer. If you want to scan things or need to print something immediately, its for that occasion.

Not for casual use",2
Printer cost is ok. But refils are costly. I tend to get refilled locally and recover cost of printer in 3 refills.,3
"nice and good product in this range and the image quality is also good
I found issue with low printer price and its toner price to higher compare so it is not gud deal
my toner hardly print 25 files",2
"Same as expected. print quality in photo paper is very good for this price.
No idea about cartridge print limitation.",5
Everythinh was good but the seller must add some printing pages with the printer also. Well i am not saying that those paper should be sold free but having some few printing pages with the pakage will be good.,3
"The black cartridge provided with the printer stop working on 20 A4 pages. Showing that the ink is finished!
How is that possible?

Sometimes scanning is not working properly.

Solve this and I will give you 5 stars",1
I have got this printer for 2000/- in Amazon festival sale. Best all-in-one printer for home based works and projects like for printing and scanning purposes.. We can refill catridge without buying new ones just use some ink refilling ones in Amazon itself and good quality too. So that you can use with less costs of print.,5
Total wastage of money. Not a good product. You have to purchase new carterige after using every carterige. You can't fill ink into it and the cost of carterige is too high and not value for money. I suggest not to buy this product because i dont want that anyone waste his money in such a worst product. Next time I will not perchase canon product.,1
I am printer purchased below 1 month is very bad condition catrage problem no warrenty,1
"Ink consumption is very high, black hardly prints 50 pages. I'm contemplating returning this product. You should have mentioned this in the product description. I have spent more than the cost of the printer. Take it back please. One of the worst printers one could buy.",1
NEVER BUY IT !! ... It comes with a demo caterage which last only for 10 to 15 pages... And u can not refill the caterage... Also its not possible to print only with one caterage...,1
you can't refill the cartridge . so everytime you have to change ink cartridge . whose price is around R.S 700 .every cartridge gives 200-300 pages print out. otherwise it is good product for printing photograph.,3
"Never buy it, one cartridge give only 10 -15 printouts. Too costly to run......can't refill the cartridge . Just wastage of money",1
Only 30 to 40 printout only taken.. Catridges are also so costly.. Its around Rs:600 /- per copy cost is around Rs: 15/- its too much costly on middle class peoples...,1
"As per price does its job, Don't expect 10000/- printer work to do on 2000/- printer, so small work at home and emergency purpose serves well, Does all it need to do and got for that price specially on emergency to print/scan and copy very handful, every house need to have it who have some kind of need.",5
Very nice. Just go for it. Delivery of Amazon is truly amazing. Perfect for house hold printing. I have purchased original cartridge Canon PG-745XL Ink Cartridge (Black) along with printer. Having complete peace of mind.,5
"Verry Bad Printing Quality and Cartridge finish within 10 Copy so it cost Rs.240/- Per copy, once cartridge finish you have to purchase new cartridge set worth rupees 1150/- for another 10 copy which will cost you 115/- per copy so not really worth to purchase this stupid printer.

Awesome product working very excellent only there was a ink cartage issue the ink capacity is low refilling is needed afer every 40 pages print of black and white and colour filling after every 28 pages,4
Good budget printer but cartridge is very ezpensive,4
Not good because of one catrige gone it will not functio and please suggest me how it will work with one ink gone waiting for reply,1
This is a good printer under 2200. The printing quality is is good and a printing speed is also sufficiently Good. The only issue is with the cartridge size this comes with a small cartridge where you can print only 40 - 50 black and white pages and 10 to 15 colour pages. So if you are aware about feeling the cartridge in economical way then this is the best printer in this budget,5
"Excellent for Home use!!!! Prints page in an excellent way as well as Xerox.!!!!
This Product is awesome and very user friendly but the cartridge is very costly
But there is always a way the cartridge can be refilled with the ink refill kit.
Have been using it for about a 3 months and is working well.",5
"Good product but the ink capacity is low we get less printout of colour or black ,but the printing is very good,also xerox is also good,and scanning is also very good.....,it is a very good printer at this price.",4
"Just a typical printer scanner. Nothing excited about this product, just a with basic features.And the cartridge comes with the printer are just to make customer fool. Only 25% are filled.",2
"Awesome printer print quality is great.
Also coping is marvellous and scans at 600dpi
What else you expect at this price.
Only the cartriges are expensive....that too can be solved by refilling them.
Good delivery amazon ...I am amazed by your service.
N.B: Be careful while installing.",4
One star is for an irritating vice and a pathetic defect provided by canon that leaves an unnecessary and excessive margin of about 17mm at bottom or at right side (in landscape mode) on any size of paper.,1
Was good one at this price....But a bit noisy....,4
Printing is good and speed is also nice.,5
Worst printer don't buy it it is just aa waste of money i have given it for replacement they have not collected it yet,1
Issues with windows 10.. IJ Scan utility not installing.. Does this have a proper driver for windows 10 ?. Regret buying this one..,1
Print Quality is good. Easy to use.,4
"This is a all in one printer from Canon, good to use, though it is an inkjet printer, the prints are fine (no clotting) and delivers the print at optimal speed. Not a bad choice for the price point.",4
Very nice product. Cartage runs out a bit fast however you always have an option of refill.,4
"The printer is awesome...
Prints good quality photos but consider ink consumption before purchasing...
But at this price it's the best option...👍👍👍",5
Nice,5
The product is defective and does not work. It is an Out of Box failure. Single star is also too much. I was cheated by Canon,1
Third class printer.. It doesn't print 4*6 photo.. Its doesn't detect paper. Bakwaas.. Bloody faltu product. Never expected from Amazon.,1
"It is a good one.I request everyone to refill the cartridge by watching videos in YouTube.
It is working nicely after refilling.",5
"it really serves the purpose though the free catridges are a bit small and gets over very quickly.
overall very happy with the same.",4
Ink jet sucks. ink cartilage dries by itself if cant be used within some days. am out of ink after taking some 30-40 prints. i think inkjet may only work for commercial use or if you need to print every day,2
Superb.....i am fully satisfied,5
The best printer in my life because it print so fast and the pictures are amazing. Scanning is also best. And you can also refill its cartridges by refill kit.,5
searched for cartridges. but could not find. my cartridges are emptied for just 10 prints. can i have the specifications of the cartridges to be used in this? i want to buy,4
Printers without easy availability of cartridges is like a body without soul! The required cartridges are seldom available offline esp. And Canon has one of the worst call centre support; so at times you will find it very frustating hunting for cartridges when u need them the most,2
GOOD PRODUCT LIKED IT,5
"Recently I purchased Canon Pixma MG2577s All-in-One InkJet Printer from amazon.
Along with that Amazon site also recommended the few refill kit. Out of that, one refill as Turbo refill kit was also recommended.
I, then, also ordered for Turbo refill kit for Canon 745 black ink cartridge.
I started using Printer and with in a week the Ink Cartridge given with Printer, got exhausted. Then I filled it with Turbo refill ink. Printer started working again however after 2 days printer stopped working.
I check with local electronic shop as Reliance Digital. They said, it might be possible that printer's drum got damaged because of Turbo ink.
They also said with this, Warranty also got breached. As per terms and condition of Canon Warranty, we cannot use ink other than Canon.
My Issues and concern:

1. If Turbo ink is compatible then why this was recommenced by Amazon.
2. why this is not highlighted that we if you use ink other than Canon, it will be violation of terms and condition of Canon Warranty.

Please advise what should i do here.",1
Good printer but cartridges get over fast....,5
Very good unit. But operates only on Windows OS and not on android.,5
"The printer is good. Print quality is well. Easy to install and easy to use.
But the cartridge of the printer gets wasted after just 1 or 2 refilling which is costly (Rs. 500). And without inserting its cartridge, it doesn't start scanning. Just waste of money!",2
Great buy for this price.,5
"The both cartridge colour and black was run out with in one month before consumption of ink. I took hardly 15 to 20 pages printout only. I have to purchased both cartridge from local market spending more than one thousand Rs.

I am supposed to get back 10% of its cost against payment by debit card. Till date it is pending.",2
Superb product !!,5
"cheat but low price for all-in-one feature its okay, the printer comes with size S cartridge, which delivers hardly 20 odd pages, very expensive refills",2
super product. you should buy.very useful . thanku amazon .,5
"Printer is not responding when I command print through laptop... It's not working... What I do...
Please help me... I m helpless with this...",1
You only paid for product not for packaging also his performance is not good but printing quality is best we take more time to print both black and colour paper.,4
Canon pixma MG2577s All in one is perfect printer.setting of it very simple we can add to windows 10 also.the printing quality is very nice & clarity is also very good .We can use it scanner as well as Xerox machine.,5
Absolutely wordt product because in one cartridge it doesn't even print you 50 pages.Complete shame.Cartridge cost is rs 945 and cannot be refilled because it doesn't get opened easily,1
"Placed the order under the flash deals on 11 October 2018 received the product on Friday, 12 October 2018, however, the product was defective (Hardware Failure). The good thing is that being in warranty did not have trouble. but now need to wait until 4 business days for a replacement. This defeats the purpose of getting it in a day and them adding 5 days to run around wasting time and money, :-(",1
"Canon Pixma MG2577s All-in-One Inkjet Colour Printer (Blue/White) please dont buy this product because this is a use and throw printer, after the maxium print count exceeds it well stop working, it cant be reset for use, even by the service centere cant fix it , its catrages are very expensive, only 90 pages for 500 rupees,",1
OK. But Cartridges too costly .,4
"Value for money since it is lowest priced among its competitors. But the running cost is high, the price of the cartridges is too much.",4
"SCANNER WORK 8 DAY, THAN AFTER STOP WORKING , ERROR CODE 22,140,121 CONTINUALLY DISPLAY. I HAVE TRY ALL SOLUTION. TRY 2 DIFFERENT SYSTEM, BUT PROBLEMS NOT SLOW. THEN I RETURN THE PRODUCT TO AMAZON.
IF ANY OTHER MISTAKE DONE BY ME, SORRY CANON.

AMAZING AMAZON .
I HAVE GET REFUND ONLY JUST 2 HOURS OF RETURNING THE PRODUCT.",1
use only for scanner otherwise very expensive for printing purpose,3
excellent product,5
Excellent product. I got what I wanted in my budget. Very fast...really fast.,5
Got this for 1999/- at Great Indian Sale ... Reached it today !! Good product less weight & easy to handle . Good printing & scanning ... Cartridge is better to refill & is cheap for refilling . Black & color cartridge together costs 1200/- ... It's better to use for home purposes & not for office purposes,4
"Printer and scanner. Using mainly for scanning purpose as I wanted a cheap and best scanning machine. It does scan and can be saved in jpeg, PDF format. Easy to use.",4
"Printer good compared price ,Black print quality superb but colour print quality low And print picture font of rows",3
Good,5
Best,5
got a defected item. not working. very very bad service from amazon. i just only want to return. dent waste your money and time on it. bad seller cloudtail.,1
Received in broken condition.,1
IS IT WI FI PRINTER .PL.ANSER ME.BECAUSE FROM MOBILE PRINTING IS POSSIBLE.,5
"Decent printer for occasional use. Its a bit noisy at every first use. Printer cartridge is a pain!! Black cartridge is around Rs.900 and Coloured one is also Rs.900 or so. If you calculate it will around Rs.1800/- which is pretty much near the pronter cost. I bought this printer few months ago for Rs.2600/-
So think twice before buying because the printer price is low but cartridges are very EXPENSIVE!
Overall the print experience is good in this price but if you are price sensitive post purchase on per page print then this is not for you! Cost per print would be around Rs.4-5 per page for black one.
Use it only in EMERGENCY!",3
Initially I received a broken printer which was relace new one after doing some calls .Initial review of mg2577 print quality is good but not excellent. But i find that scnanner quality was very poor as compared to other printer . Ther was no sharpnes in image scanned by the scanner. I have takken about 5- 10 pages . I have opned the printer found that the build is good inside and there was good protection for catridges . As compared to hp its catridge are cheap u should always try to refill it with prodot ink or go colour ink as your choice thank u,3
Worst Printer.. Never Buy.. Printing cost about Rs.15/- per print.. You cannot print economically. Need to replace cartridge frequently which costs appox. a total of INR 1500/-. This printer is surly became e-waste soon.,1
it is good product ..i suggest this product for all . if you want any queries pls mail me to barathanbegins@gmail.com Canon Pixma MG2577s All-in-One InkJet Printer (Blue/White),5
"Initially got a faulty printer, placed for replacement. The whole process took 5 days. Very satisfied with the printer. Monochrome printing is very fast and very good color print quality for such price and cartridges are cheap too.",5
"Guys, in this price range only I can say that, this option will be the best if you are looking for All in One inkjet printer. One thing I want to mention that people who are saying that it consume a lot of ink is not actually like that.

Inkjet printer are usually not for professional use, they are basically for home based used only. If you need heavy prints than should chose a laser printer. What else I can say that in this price range you will get everything which is not a bad deal guys.",5
"Waste product in spite of writing so many times to get it replace no respose, it's defective not working even once. Customer service is also not responding.",1
The cartridge which was received with this printer has printed only 20 pages....We have changed the cartridge only after few days....So it is costly for us as compared to taking printouts from outside..,2
"Worst product don't buy cheap printer below 7000 it does not work properly and the cartridge is empty after only 36 pages wtf, the cost of printing is too high buy only hp printers if u want better savings per page.",1
"This printer I had gifted to my nephew but after two prints it’s not working and showing no ink on the screen.
Please advice me what to do about this

"thumps up, only complain, cartridges are too high in price",5
Simple to handle machine,5
Pathetic,1
"Ink cartridge is improper black and colour ink is not completely filled after taking about 4 to5 copies alarm is blinging, and you don't have correct CD for installation",1
Very good product easy printing,5
I'm suggesting you all to buy this printer for home or office use. It is best for office use not for the purpose of commercial. We can scan any images or documents. We get a editing software with this which can worth upto 700rs. If u like the printer please reply to. What's app 8105024554,5
super Good,5
Very good printer for home use. I liked it n recommend it to all,5
Damaged item received,1
"I have purchased the printer on October 2016. After taking 15 B&W, 8 colour prints, it stopped working. The printing totally stopped and when tried to take xerox I got blurred image.",1
"I have used this product only few days and got faulty. pls don't buy this. can not refill the ink, need to buy new cartridge, it is expensive.
DON'T BUY.

One of the worst product from Canon, god promise don't buy. if any body from canon pls contact me and prove me this product is best.",1
Printing cost is very high 👎🏻,1
"it does not work, default product is being supplied by the company,. Both companies, canon and amazon are involved in supplying useless product to the customer. I deposited it back in customer care center, s p verma road patna.",1
First of all I have to tell you that it's just a marvelous product.You can go for it.The printer is packed well.its hard to break.there is no problem in delivery side.i have got it delivered fast.colour and black and white prints are just awesome,5
It's not recommended for photo printing and consumption of ink Is too fast.,3
I buy this printer but after one month it not works it seems to change both catridge then I changed the catridge after some Days it seems the same problem machine signals that to change catridge how is this possible to change a new catridge within one week,1
"Prints, scans, does everything they say.. but cartridge just waste of money.. the cartridge has a low capacity of ink",2
Product is good and printing fast also but it is possible to refill the ink plz help it is possible,4
Budget friendly,5
"It works just fine. Problem starts when we use same cartridge for ink refill. Canon detects that you are trying to ""cheat"" them of their main income source - Cartridges. It wont let you print after the refill saying ""Cartridge Empty"". Even if we press the STOP button for 10 seconds, it may once a while print, generally it wont print.",1
very nice printer. i totally satisfied. friends u can buy it without any doubts.,5
"After 8 months use, power has not come and completely out of order.
I cannot recommend this for long use.",2
"The best printer i had seen and buyed.a unique printer i seen which prints documents,photos and many more if someone who needed a printer should take this",5
waste money..do not buy,1
Very use to home.,4
"In this price cannon 2577s is super
Photo copy
Scanning
Color print
Black and white everything is perfect and so clear hd type",5
"Nasty product. Paper gets jammed too often
Ink got exhausted in three prints. Wish could return it",1
"The performance of the printer is fine but then, the cartridge provided is bad. Hardly a 50 pages and the ink is done...
After refilling, it hardly lasts for another 20 to 30 pages...
Not at all happy with this type of performance.. ..",1
Not able to use.Very difficult to use.,1
Best of personal use. I bought it for mainly scanning photo and documents since I use printing option very less often.,4
Great One. Got It In Perfect Condition . Have Been Using It Since 3 Weeks .. No Problems Till Now . Of course the Cartridge is a bit pricey and refilling The Cartridge is a bit difficult especially If you are a beginner .. But the Product is Worth the money..,4
"Ink consumption is very fast, black ink cartridge provided with the printer was able to print only 22 pages. So overall very high ink cartidge consumption and cartridges are pretty much most of the cost of the pritner.",3
Fair product,2
Black ink only 5 pages print after sowing no black ink,3
Never ever purchasr this printer ..loss of money ..ink cartridge cannot b filled easily and for 10 pages it will get empty..,1
"Print quality is really nice. I am happy with the product. However the cartridges were last only for few pages. Since the major cost of the printing is cartridge, i would expect initial set must be fresh and print at least 100 copies.",4
Excellent product you nailed it.delivery before time Amazon me acche din AA gai....excellent supply chain amazon.cloudtail...fedex.......brillient....happy ....proud Amazon prime customer.,5
Printer scanner was faulty during initial installation. So Canon replaced printer. We have hardly used the printer and cartridge is over. Extremely disappointed.,1
Your Pinter not working,1
Good for printing photos but not text documents as it is inkjet. You don't get that sharpness in the text.,5
I buyed a new printer just two weeks ago. The cartilage ink got over in just 37 copies and now I cannot print without getting it refilled. The new cartilage cost around Rs 700. The per page rate the user needs to pay is Rs 37. For me I will rate this product zero stars.,1
"Good product at reasonable price....
Easy way of setup... Just follow the manual provided and install the CD at the end in your PC/Laptop. Follow the instructions.
Read before clicking any option.
Doesn't take much time to print... maximum 5 seconds to print 1 side.",5
Waste product. It's only can use for scanning. Cartridges are very high cost. We can buy another printer instead of Cartridges. EPSON L3 series is better to fill the ink. It's my opinion only. Thanks for giving this opportunity.,1
The printer is very good. I just wish the refill cartridges were a bit cheaper.,4
I have received product with scanner fault and the service centre is going to replace the same.,2
Worst of all. Every one say it is good if u can spend 5 rs to print one page. Once your cartridge is completed then you cannot easily found. Printer is cheap but ink cartridge is very costly and comes very very less pages,1
Ultimate Amazon... Worth for money,5
Not able to get even 30 print.,2
good for average printing purpose.. not for high end..but best value for money..,4
Excellent,5
"Please dont buy this, u will regret",2
"Very easy install , simply home use , ,but never WiFi mode , its not worth because USB connected with android mobile not supported this series only computer supported this printer",2
I love the Printer standard and the way Amazon delivered was superb.. it was fully packed and received it in a 100% Quality manner.,5
Scanner does not work properly n cartigage capacity is upto 50 pages,3
"the ink cartridges are just too small, one black cartridge just gives ard 15 prints. and the noise the printer makes while printing is too loud.",3
in starting i was happy with its working but it stopped working after a week i had to return it..the ink provided was also very less.. don't buy.. rather buy epson,1
"Excellent product Easy to operate and faster prints.
It has cool style and have fast scaning and photocopy in a minute.
Also I liked the Amazon prime service to get the order between the Great Indian Sale and faster delivery.",5
"Very promt delivery. Product I good as I expected. best product all in one i.e. color printer, scanner & photocopy in good price.",5
"Good printer for household.
But the software is too heavy and the printed ink takes time 5-8 seconds to dry completely.
Otherwise the design is very good, the speed is good etc.
Overall its a good value for money printer for household.",3
It is best product for houseuse.,5
Pathetic quality ink cartridges last only for 7 prints after that it's a waste.pls suggest a way to avail warranty on the printer,1
"Ridiculous - comes with cartridge that prints only 20-30 pages.

Breaks down more no of times than pages printed.",1
Awesome product. Quality prints quick scan and copy. Happy to choose Canon. Quite useful.,5
Canon pixma 2577s all in one good quality product and nice working i had given four star but It will have one more of dark copy and light copy than can I able to give five star so anyway it's ok thanks to Amazon and canon company,4
Received in time.Able to take print from scanner. Not able to take print from Laptop. It is showing as low ink. Taken only about 10-15 prints.,3
great,5
"Not a great printer! paper gets jammed all the time, we have to fill ink very frequently, the ink in the cartridge hardly comes for 50 pages and even the cartridges available are expensive. Scanner settings are confusing, even though set the settings to your desired file format it will show as pdf and you can't change the format and a copy of that file will be stored as image somewhere. I would say is totally not worth to buy.",3
Good used,5
The product quality is good but it's ink is too costly because it hardly prints 50copies from two cartridge,1
It is okay to use for an occasionally as the inks are costlier and might be use more ink than other printers. Overall a good and reasonable product to use.,4
Amazing product for this price range. Nicely done. Nicely done!!,5
"Solid good quality, a bit sound but very fast. Only the delivery was delayed took 6 days.",5

"The product is a nice one, easy to install and use. But the cartridges are very small in size and costly too. This makes it bit uncomfortable. The cartridges get empty soon after some number of prints.",5

"About Demo Cartridge:
COLOR: (STANDARD PRINT: 5 PAGES approx & DRAFT PRINT: 15 approx)
BLACK: (STANDARD PRINT: 8 PAGES approx& DRAFT PRINT: 20 approx)

About Printer:
1. Takes 2-3 minutes to initialize on first startup i.e. every-time you switch it on.
2. Print quality Good. (8/10)
3. White Plastic Body Part of Printer Attract dust very much.
4. Scanner Shutter is not heavy it means to scan clearly you have to put some weight on it.
Solution: Put main document to scan on ""Scanner Glass Surface"" then put some more A4 Unused White Papers on the main document then close the scanner shutter and put some heavy book on it.
5. Scan Quality is Good and Preview Quality is Poor so don't get stunned to see blur preview just complete the scan and see the quality of the output, its really good. SCAN QUALITY: (8/10).
6. Printing Time: STANDARD QUALITY PRINT: 10-17 SECONDS & DRAFT QUALITY PRINT: 5-12 SECONDS.

**EVERYTHING IS WORKING GOOD I WISH THE SCANNER SHUTTER WAS HEAVY ENOUGH LIKE OTHER PRINTERS JUST BECAUSE OF THAT SCANNING PROCESS GONE INTO MULTIPLE STEPS.**",4

"I rate this 4 star because of two reasons
1. Printer does not have plug and play feature to install it first time. &
2. The ink cartridges from Canon actually cost you almost the same as the printer.

However a good printer with scanning facility and various other features. I am waiting to explore all the other features",4
"One of the worst printers .NEVER EVER BUY!! With just 12 prints..the cartridge showed its empty! How does the company claim that it give 100 prints. The cartridge is expensive. Surprisingly one has to print black and colour together, why????",1
"AMAZON make a amazing offer to buy this product at dhassra ... i read more reviews which gives me negative thought about this printer . but I have confident the amazon not a small online store .they tied up more then 6.3 million products. so i ordered this printer .by way of mind voice. this A-I-O printer working amazingly. printing,scan , copy at speedy

thanks to amazon to use this printer as genuine , looking nice , my 6 years baby also using very frequently like copy , print and scan .1 st time printed more then 50 pages and after refilled the demo cartridges and printed over 50 pages . till it waiting for print more pages ....

thanks to amazon for wonderful product which i was used more then 5 months",5
"This one drinks ink like a lambo hardly printed 7 pages and ink was over they give only a demo catridge , low cost printer with a hefty rates for ink",1
I went through the customer feedback of the printer and realized that I have to bear Costly printing if I decide to use it. So I requested to make return the unused printer but Amazon did not respond for returning the product. Rather they are advising to make correspond with the technical team of Canon. Totally disgusting.,1
Nice,5
"I ordered this printer for rs1,999 on 5th October 2016 and got it delivered on 12 October 2016.
I checked this model on the official website and other sites but didn't found this product. Anyway coming to the product, the print quality is superb but the printer itself wastes 4-5 colour prints in the name of testing. Overall 10-12 pages were printed (including colour and black & white). On the box it said 100 pages can be printed and when I contacted them, they said it was just a sample. Anyway for my price it was avg.",3
"I purchased this printer 2 days back. It is not working. The seller supplied the printer with defective cartridges. I request for return so many time, But I am unable to return. I request all, don't buy this product from this seller. I am have started to file case in consumer court.",1
wort buying very fast and reliable,5
"You can print only 7 or 8 pages with the demo cartridges that come with the new printer. After that buying both the color and B&W cartridges costs more than the cost of the printer. Better go with HP printer. Even if the printers are a little bit more pricey, the per-page cost of printing is lot more cheaper with HP cartridges.",1
Good product for my work,4
"Please don't buy not at all useful.catrige capacity is too low you have to refill lots of time
I personally advice don't go by price tag
Check total operation cost n easily accessible to refill",1
Canon pixma mg2577s printer is very good and like a beautiful.thank u amazon.,5
"Canon is making customers fool by giving all in one printer at low prices and making money from ink cartridges.
Cartridges yield:-
Black :- hardly 37 pages
Colour :- 29 pages

Cartridges Cost
Black:-₹920/-
Colour :- ₹1240/-

If you want printer go for HP.",2
"Amazon cheated me of 10% cash back on visa card payment through their app during the May 2017 offer period. Their customer care confirmed that i am eligible for the cash back but after 25 days when i called the customer care on the non receipt of the cash back they say i am not eligible and the first CC agent made a mistake.

Getting disgusted on their attitude and lack of business ethics, I asked the product to be returned and put in a request but nothing happened.
My advice before buying on offers on amazon, ask for confirmation email on your cash back/ offer as proof else, they will cheat you! after all, these are the people who put mahatma Gandhi's and Hindu gods pictures on the slippers! what else can you expect from these bigots.

As for the product, it is flimsy and made of cheap plastic. Print quality is good though. Scanner works just fine. This input is of 26 days of use.",1
Good to buy at this price range. You have to follow many steps before make it functional .,4
"Great product for the price. Based on my earlier experience, it does everything it claims to do. The MFP is compact, light and easy to use. The only downsides are that scanning speed is a bit slower than slightly expensive ones but is tolerable. And it gobbles ink, about 30-50 pages depending on usage before a refill.",4
Its an excellent product . Btw where can i get warranty/guarranty informations of this product ?,5
"The initial ink provided will only give black -15 & color- 15 pages print out
But the cartridge can be replaced No Worries.
All-n- all the printer is awesome :-) Very stylish & gives good printing experience.
Hence 5 stars.",5
Worlds Most Costly ink cartridge Printer & Worst printer. I received a damaged product of which its scanner glass is broken and I want now refund otherwise I will seriously case forward on this,1
Excellent product go for it!! Im really confused b/w canon mg 2577s and hp deskjet 2131 but latter i choose canon bcoz of its gloryfing name in inkjet printers!!! My decidion is correct.. it is very good printer at this range but 1 dissapointment is this that catridge provided with it is very small quantity ink almost 10-20 pages are printed from both!!!!! Well this is best printer for me!!!,5
There is no warranty card,1
"I purchased this printer for home use . So far it has been working fine . I am impressed with quality of prints which seems lot better than laser prints.
Easy to operate and with XL range of cartridge cost does not hit much.
This printer is not for bulk print but for home use . I bought it for 2399 which is throw away price.
Received product in good condition and delivered timely .
I don't think printer of this quality can be purchased at this price anywhere else. true value for money.

So far taken 20 pages and still ink left in the cartridge. Go for it if you want easy to handle printer with good print quality at reasonable maintenance cost for cartridge",4
"Its an okay printer overall but please note that the cartridges supplied with it are demo ones. The printer is very light and sleek. I would suggest you to first refill the demo cartridges before using them for the first time. This will make them give more prints. The print speed is normal. Print quality is good and adjustable.
If you want a printer for home purpose for less frequent use, then go for it. However it may not be a good option for business purpose.",3
"cost effective but ink in demo & the new one is costly, you may try it with refilling by ink sold in the market just like prodot & gocolor which are cheaper
now it gets cheap all round I get it in05-03-2017 as 2499 rupee but now it is cheap as 2095 rupee
I will print about 40 pages till now from 20 days & it continues with demo one",5
Worst service didnt work properly,1
"was afraid to buy a printer online, but to my surprise everything went really well..
it was easy to connect, install and use
the scanner too works beautifully",5
This printer catradge is very worrest,1
"Best printer for those who are looking for a cheap printer under 2500 rs because you are getting a printer with refillable ink cartridge.
You can refill ink cartridge by making holes in it and the filling ink.
You can see which ink to fill in which hole in YouTube.
Just fill the ink and reset the printer then your printer will be ready to use.",4
"the printer is very good it working nice
100% original product ....thanks amazon",5
Me to loot gaya bhai...,1
"Shall I give zero stars Really waste of yr money it doesn't work I have received defected piece
Please please please don't purchase it
You can go through hp printers",1
"The cartridge that came with the pack got over after I printed just 3-4 pages... Upon enquiring with Canon, I was told the cartridge is only a demo cartridge and I should buy new ones. I had to spend Rs. 1300/- to buy cartridges within few days of product purchase.

This was not clearly mentioned in product page. If this fact was clearly mentioned, I would have considered some other products as well, because after all this printer is 'NOT AS PRICE EFFICIENT' as it apparently looks like.

Other printers come with original cartridges. So take this parameter into consideration while deciding a printer for you, because if you just go with price of this product, you will be misled.",3
OK--INSTALLED--WORKING TO MY SATISFACTION,4
A very nice and good product in this ramge and the image quality is also good,5
"Great product at best price. It was amazing that Amazon delivered the product within two days. I had no trouble setting this printer with my desktop. The machine is small, portable and handy. Only thing is that the user interface of its software is NOT so user friendly. I usually use machine to scan personal documents, newspaper article, etc. Like HP Assistant gives you option to crop the image before saving it in PDF but this software saved the complete image with white area around the small article. May be I need to learn to figure this out. Hopefully this products serve its purpose of ""All in One"" and last long. Thank you friends for reading this review.",4
Wrost product the scanner is not working good and the printing quality is bad,1
"Wast of money. Cartage price is 1300 -1400(about half cost of printer) . And without Cartage u can not use a single function of this toy, even not scan a document if Cartage are empty or remove. If i know abt this i never purchase it. Dont make fool guys.. and one more thing refilling of Cartages by injection syringe is not working . . After one of two refilling cartages will dead. ..",1
The price is dam cheap for the features but wireless expected,4
"The printing quality of this printer is really good.. As i have used it.. So, in my openion its a good buy... But it has some bad side of it... i.e., Cartridges gets empty fast.. I didnot even print 50 pages there was a warning lamp indicating about low ink in both the cartridges.. It takes some time to set up and you have to do some printing ,xerox test and scan a sheet of printed paper as shown in manual then you are all ready to use it.. But the fact is if you use low gsm papers your ink will be sucked more and which results in emptying your cartridges fast.. So, I prefer not to use low gsm papers.. And try getting large cartridges.. Small finishes fast..",4
Not good printer. Just OK you spend more money for ink cartridges.,2
"Please read the advice this advice for all who had make a plan to buy this canon mg2577s because all had thought that its price is only 2500rs and the other printer like HP , Epson are cost of 10000rs or more but this is not a good one because the cartridge price too high 3000rs for 300 pages and you can't able to refill it while the the Epson l380 had price of 10500rs but the cartridge price is 2000rs for 11000 pages",1
good printer I like it.,5

Color print is costly",1
"Super noisy.
Cartridge got finished after 10 prints.
But quality of print is good. I like the packing. Thumbs up for that",3
Product is useless not working showing 5011 error no online support also you have to take it to support center,1
"Just hate it, Never think about customer. Taking about a month to deliver a product. I will never purchase from Cloudtail.",1
Instead of 'Start' Canon should have written 'Copy'.,5
Good product but received without printer ink,3
it is not service properly it is not print accurate,1
Very bad quality. A new cartridge can print only 5 pages max. Anyone please suggest how to return this,1
"Good product in low budget., loved it",5
"Nice printer...it gives 60 pages with black given cartridge. Good printing /scanning speed. But remember to avoid head cleaning / alignment as much as possible, to save ink. After ink is over make hole in cartridge & fill it with ink available in market & u can use it many times. & always refill it before cartridge ink runs out ;)",5
Very good at this price. The scanner and ths printer works perfectly. If you are looking for low budget efficient printer. Go for it.,5
pls dont show in my order i aleady brought it from u.and am a happy.,5
"Don't look at the star which I gave to the product as I will change that once I will have the replacement, I asked for. To be very honest, Printer is awesome, I don't think that cartridges are that much costly as people are saying over here, also the printing speed is too good, the only problem I faced with my set was that Scanner was not working. I tried with all the efforts, I searched in Google for a few hours to get a resolution of the problem, but unfortunately it all goes into vein. Here I would like to appraise the Customer Support team of Amazon as well, they immediately asks for a replacement when I told them the issue, I am waiting for the replacement to come, and I will review it once again....",1
Very very nice product at lowest price in amazon....,5
Why it always shows that there is no ink in it.i had inserted ink but it shows that there is no ink,1
It ink is empty,1
Goooooood,5
Product is not good,1
"It is a good printer, scanner, and photocopier in good price Range.",5
We don't get cartridges in the open market and they are above 500-900 and ink consumption is high value for the printer only in price.,1
Brother cannot buy this product worst product,1

"Very worse printer

There are not services facility of canon",1
"Its very nice to look
Now my conon pima mg2577s is not working only for 20 days",1
Waste of money&time,1
"I bought this printer with my Amazon Business account. This printer is cheap and good. The only problem with all inkjet printers is the replacement cost of normal capacity cartridge is equivalent to the cost of the printer itself. The trick here is manufacturers sell the printers lesser than manufacturing cost, later they recover loss from selling inks and cartridegs at a higher cost. So I had to hack my cartridge after seeing various YouTube tutorials and had to refill the cartridge with cheap alternative inks available in Amazon. Now the printer is working great but at a cheaper refill cost.",5
"Day 1 review: product nicely packed.. safely delivered.
If you think one fine fatty you will do 50 page scanning . This is not the product. For INR1990 how much once should expect? 😊
Print quality is good. It's a fail safe printer. If your kid needs last minute print then can be relied upon.

Anyways for a occasional use I would suggest this printer. If you want print 10pages a day then increase your budget to 7k. Better options in that range.",3
Ink cartridges very bad,1
Not up to the mark,3
only a mont Work properly .,1
good product,5
"Very Good Printer For this price .I Bought it on Prime Day Sale at Just 2000 .For this price You get a scanner a printer both colour and black and white .

Pros
• Obviously Price .It's Really Affordable
•All in one Scanner+ Xerox+ Printer
•Scanning is Super Fast (1secs) & Printing Black (2secs) Colour (5-6secs)

Cons
• Only Cons is Its Ink . First time you will get a free cartridge but that prints only 30-40 Pages
Ink cost around black(Rs630) Colour (Rs649)

All in one For Moderate Use it's ok but For ink it's Too costly .Rather if you have More printing work buy a ink tank printer it will be more effective.",4
"I use it since 2017 december. Good Print and picture quality. This image print out from this device. Photo ptinting can lowering ink level very fast. Colour is not fade and water resistant. Price of Original catridges are very high and not easily available in local market. Only Good for uses as scanner. Don't refill your catridge or buy any third party compatible catridge, its void warranty of your printer.",3
"Sincere suggestion - Never opt for a Canon Printer. The very material arrived defective on 21.09.16. Didn't get any backup support - neither from Amazon nor the Seller. Tired of calling the Toll free Canon Support's number. After registering complain thrice a person visited, explained me that I made a very big mistake buying online & that as the product is defective by birth I must get it replaced from the seller or initiate a refund from Amazon. No specific time can be given from Canon India for Warranty replacement or repairing. The printer is lying dead in the box as it is.
ITS A BAD PRODUCT WITH A VERY BAD AFTER SALE SUPPORT.",1

I will recommend to do the purchasing from Amazon only.,5
The printer is good looking. The printing quality is awesome. Easy to use. light weight. Occupies less space. The only problem is that the cartridge cost is high but it is the same problem in every inkjet printer in this price range. I got this in 1949/- during AMAZON GREAT INDIAN SALE.

Printer cartridge is not satisfying. Company says -it gives prints approx 100, but empty on 50-55 print.
Cartridge is too costly- both cartridge (small) price lie between ₹1700- ₹2300.
Printing is costly otherwise- a good printer.",4

"CL-746S - the MRP of this colour cartridge is 746/- and it supposedly prints/yields 100 pages if you print continuously. That is 7.50/- per page only for the ink! Add paper and other costs, its at least 10/- per page.

One must be crazy to buy this printer. Its a shame that Amazon suggests this printer as an ideal for ""occasional home printing""!! What a collusion!",1
Does it supports windows 8.1,4

"Printer is good. But the catridge that comes with the printer is for demo purposes and would not print more than 15 to20 sheets. You cannot refill the catridge as there is no system for that. Local shops might do it by making a hole in the catridge but the printer stores the catridge information and still consider it as empty. And NO, you can't even scan when the catridge is empty. You will be forced to buy the catridge after a long headache and it would cost you 2000 rupees. This was my experience. But once I changed the catridge, I have had no trouble. So it's basically 4000/- rupees of expenditure if you want this!",3

I ordered this printer yesterday and guess what.. I received it today. Installation of the printer is very simple. I think as far as value is concern its worth it. For home users its value for money. Highly recommended,5
Printing cost is too high...5 rs for black and 8 rs for color....sometimes even more.,1

Ok. I like it,1
Great buy. Excellent machine with complete features at this price.,5
"Printer does really good quality colour prints, but many of us print from phone, iPad or laptop remotely. It makes more sense to have printer with wifi. Some printers in this price comes wifi built in. Buying or launching USB alone printer in this idea in my opinion is really a bad idea. But it's still personal opinions vary.",4

"Good product for occasional printing. But takes lots of ink to print. Not economical at all.
For regular use go for ink/laser printers. This is good for occasional printing only.
Other functions like xerox and scan also works as expected. Overall nice product.",4
"The printer is awesome, easy to connect and use but the cartridge cost a lot and doesnt prints 500 pages.1 cartridge prints only 200-250 pages max. And you cannot refill cartridge. So better to buy an ink tank.",4
If you want a good all in one at a reasonable price this is for you. Ideal if you don’t need to print large quantities every day.,5
Not at all worth it where there is no repairs centre....,1
Please don't buy. You will spend all your hard money in buying cartridges.,1

"Comes With Awesome Print Quality, Best In Budget & Easy To Install. Loved It . I Would Recommand This Only The Cons Is Ink Is lil Bit worthy.",5
"Don't buy this printer, you can only print 20 to 30 A4 with a cartridge!",1
"please do not purchase this printer, initially it works smoothly. I purchased it in 2016, in a year i printed only around 50-60 print. in 2017 i also printout only 10-15 copies. Now its not working as shows continuously light blink and did not take print from computer. I have checked it various OS, other laptops,desktop also. But it wont print, only continuously blinking light. I asked to my friend who purchase same printer before 1 year. He is also facing the same problem. Even he exchanged new printer from thana office becaz his printer is in warranty. The new printer also shows same problem after 3-4 months. And this problem is not repaired, we also given for repaired but it doesnt solve.",1
"Price is so attractive, but consumes lots of ink. And picture quality is okay for this price. And best for office uses.
Hp says ink cartridges need to be replaced but it could be refilled easily with the help of YouTube videos.
I am satisfied with this product.
But now a days better printers with ability to print from mobile devices are available in market with attractive prices.
I just wanted a printer for emergency printing needs only so I bought it and I am happy with it.",4
I brought it for home use but product is not working... I try to call Amazon but there is no contact details. Try to refund/exchange it but i was told I can't exchange. How come company like HP and Amazon not responding for default product?? Very very dissatisfied.,1
"making very ugly sound..
and after print 20 pages shows low ink..
worst printer ever",1
"प्रोडक्ट खराब है , चालू नहीं हो रहा है।",1
Bought it for 1.7k worth for the money. I'm using HP laptop so no need of installation anything. Color and black cartridges available in the box. Checked both color and black and white print out. No issues at all.,5
"Call me old fashioned but i prefer paper over digital, so when it comes to read notes i want them in my hand , or when i want facts over a topic i want all the material in printed form, This printer helped me a lot in that , i got it for 1800 rs from Amazon, and it's worth so much than that , first of all its size is so compact and its built is very sturdy ,and i have a epson ink tank filter at office but this prints faster than that , speed is really impressive! Just go for it , pfa images depicting size of the printer",5
"Good quality of printing,easy to install, getting colord prinout eazliy at home use",5
"Only buy if you know well about refilling cartridge and troubleshooting problems afterwards. Otherwise it will cost you a lot money. It only prints 100- 120 pages per cartridge. Replacing both cartridge may cost up 1500. So it costs 6-7 rupees per page. If you can refill the cartridge, then it's an value for money printer( then it will cost you time, lol)",3
"Despite of all the negative reviews posted about of this product, I would say that this is a very good printer with competitive price. It always not true that cheap products perform bad. Yes, this one is a bit dedicated and you need to handle it very carefully.
So far I have printed more than 100 pages black and white and more than 25 color pages including 6 full page images.
You need to refill the cartridges at home, which as easy as to use the printer itself. After refilling black cartridge it is still working well.
The only thing that you need to keep in mind that print at least one page daily, otherwise the cartridge will dry and that will create difficulties.
Thank You...",5
"If you are looking for a budget single use printer. This is best in the available products.

My previous printer was also hp, but was very old, but there was no problem with it. Just Its cartridge cost was more than the price of this product, so bought this. Size is very small and it easily fits inside my almirah.",5
"It uses up a lot of ink while printing! And with pictures and double-sided printing, the paper (normal printing paper-A4, 70-75 GSM) takes a long time to even dry! Would not recommend it at all. Do not get lured by the cheap price of the printer. It ultimately is not at all an economical printer.",1
"working fine from last 15 days. took 10-15 colour prints and its doing good. not sure how long cartage will last but its good for now. Also, i noticed genuine cartage is as expensive as printer :)",5
"First it is value of money 100 percentage,and thank u Amazon delivered the item in 24hrs I unexpected, this printer advantage is print good quality, I print continually 20 pages the print is little bit slow and it's support android phone connect with otg cable working properly, I study many commands in this printer but 50percentage are fake comments iam thinking, we insert a4 size paper means it did not stuck so use a4 sheet paper for good use, and I print 20 pages in 1 day, so it is good to use and we can refill the cartage easily it available in you tube you can see and fill the ink Easily, The we get 100 ml ink bottle in Amazon or flipksart at the prize just 250 rupees, and I use and command later✌",4
NICE PRODUCT BUY EVERYONE ITS SMALL AND LOW WEIGHT OF PRINTER IT IS BUY THIS,5
"It does exactly what it says. I don't print often so I didn't want to invest in a costlier printer. This worked like a charm, the colors are vivid, the B&W print is sharp. It's not too slow but it is a bit noisy which is ok. It was easy to set up. Happy with it so far.",5
"We print about 10 pages a month, so this printer is perfect. Yes, it's a bit slow (10 sec/ paper) and a little noisy, but honestly that's nitpicking. The speed or noise are not disturbing in any way. I also read a lot of reviews about cartridges not being available - not true. It was probably an issue in August alone from when the reviews are. Only problem with this printer - double sided printing is not fun. I'm still trying to figure out how it works when there are more than 2 pages.",5
"For very occasional home use, this is a very good printer - I previously had a MFP Inkjet that stopped working after a very long gap of not using it, For those who have very infrequent use, I think this small form factor is better. It is so light weight and fits just above my CPU - see pic! (so I can remember to take occasional prints to keep the printer live). Bigger printers (like Ink tank) definitely turn out cheaper per page in long run provided you have that much use/ year. But in a scenario of WFH in the corona lock down needing to take occasional prints for office and kids school use - this one is the best!",4
The Printer is good for self home use . But the New Cartridge cost is more or less equal to Printer cost . HP should look in to Cartridges of Economical Printers should be cheap also,5
"Guyz. Dont go for any kind of cartage printer.. if you really need a printer, go for ink tank printers. I know its costlier, but almost 30 time (calculated) more efficient.. believe me of repent like me.. ,,🤣",5
I am giving 1 star because its sucks inks like anything. Ink cartridge is too much costly and hence makes printer un usable and waste of monty,1
"I have been using this printer since 2019 and I just took prints and thought why not write the truth about it.
I have printed over 2000 pages till now and I have been using the same Cartridge that came with the printer when I bought it.
I just refill the Cartridge instead buying a new one. The New Cartridge by hp can only print 50-60 pages. You can refill and prints as many pages you want.
Buy this printer and buy the ink bottles you get. 2ml of the refilled ink gives me at least 60-70 prints.
The ink bottle will cost you around Rs. 150-200 and it will have 100ml. That's roughly 5000+ prints give and take.
So total investment = 1500(Printer) + Ink(200) = 1700/-
That's roughly 2 rupees per print! By the time you get around 2000 prints, your printer cost is covered and the next prints will be free of cost.",3
"This prints 20 to 30 pages only (incl.black and color print outs).
The main drawback is once the original ink is over that's it..its a waste..either.You have to buy Hp black and hp color inks(price is higher than the printers price) or buy local brand inks and get an average colored print outs.
My opinion is to better buy good printers which is more than rs.10,000/- so that the cartridges refilling costs you less and also you can take good qty and qlty color prints.",2
"Its good in this price range, if you want to printer only 10-30 print in a month then buy otherwise go for laser printer if you need more printing as for more print , cost will be higher.

Its for home usage",5
Good for home use.its speed of printing is so best than other colour printer.its print quality is also best. but only one thing which is not good that it's cartridge cost is high.,5
Nice product,4
"It does the job alright. Easy to install on my dell laptop. As i use this to print confidential document occasionally( 3 to 4 per month) , it serves the purpose. Prints fast. Quality is also acceptable on Draft mode and Ink Saver mode. But the only downside is that although i used the black and white for printing 25 pages so far, the ink level on color catridge reduced to 50 %. Not sure how this is possible. But black ink came down to only 75%.",4
Product are good but not CD drive and missing 1212 drive in online,2
Aftervtee prints only black cartridge stopped working properly. Printing half text. Did all trouble shoot n cleaning but it gives hard time,1
"Warning! It does not work with Mac. The printer was detected and job queued but nothing prints. I had to use a windows computer to print. In terms of quality, it is average. Cheap printer can't expect much. Black print few letters are smudged or unclear but acceptable. I'll probably throw it away once ink is over.",3
Awesome printer... Bought for only ₹1900 during the early benefits for prime members of Great Indian Sale Prime Benefits.. Must buy this printer for home use... Happy to use..,5
"Simply the best printer I've ever come across. I just needed a printer and not a scanner included which always malfunctions and ruins the entire product.
The product was packed very well and was delivered within five hours of me having ordered it. Package included two 803 cartridges, one with black ink and the other coloured ink.
Installation software was downloaded from the HP website and took a few minutes and I was ready to print within half an hour of halving received the product.
It's been more than two weeks since I've been printing on and off and you don't need to print everyday to keep it going, once a week would be enough to keep the ink in the cartridge from drying up.",5
"Don't ever buy this printer, the catriges will be empty just after 10 prints and no matter how many original Hp catriges you buy from Hp the printer never works. This printer is just a disposable printer. It never works after printing 10 pages. The seller didn't even gave me any invoice with the printer I am cheated by both Amazon and Hp.",1
"HP is selling absolute trash in the form of this printer.
I have been hardly able to print a few pages and the printer is now not taking paper correctly.
I tried all options but it always takes one end of the paper faster than the other and so the paper gets stranded in a slanted manner right at the tray, wont go in.
Very disappointed customer, have been cheated before on HP laptops and now add a HP printer to the list. Never going to buy anything HP from now on, much better options out there.
Stay away from this cheap excuse for a printer.",1
Read carefully before you buy. This seems to be an old model.,2
Software CD is damaged and I am unable to install the software. After printing 20 document pages the cartridge shown less than 50%. I wants to return the same but option is available in my order but it do not proceed after second step.,2
"Its cheaper to buy this entire printer again rather than buying it ink cartridges,
One cartridge prints about 30 A4 pages at best quality, its a good emergency-use printer, but seriously dont waste your money, save up a little and go for an Ink-Tank printer
This has way too many problems for its cost

But, the print quality is surprisingly amazing, the printer has that plug and play usability and its a one click print kind of a printer.

Still the concept of ink cartridges has scared me enough after buying this printer.....would never recommend anyone else to buy this",2
"I am writring this almost after 2.5 months of usage. The printer printed almont 100-120 black and white pages and only 10-15 colour pages. Those of you who are using windows10 on old laptop and PCs, installation can be a bit of a challenge. But the printer works fine even with old laptop models. Follow the following steps to installing printer drivers correctly:
Go to : https://www8.hp.com
1.Go to support option
2.Click on Softwares & drivers
3.Click on printer image
4. Type ""HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1200 series"" full name (no initials) in the textbox
5.Click Submit
6.Download all the softwares, drivers and software utilities under drivers tab before installing for smooth installation.
Note: Please check printer compatibility with your system before buying.",5
"Printer is good for home usage where u don't need to print daily or in bulk..its not for students wanting to printing study material, bcz it only prints 120 pages after that u need to refill cartridge..also since it's a basic printer, it's kinda slow.
Otherwise print quality is good and colours are great and vibrant",3
"Day 2:
This is the cheapest deskjet/inkjet printer available. Good for home / student use only.
Convenient for printing pages which you don't want to share at a photocopying/printing shop from privacy/confidentiality perspective. Printing at such shops is much cheaper than home printer.
This is lightweight and doesn't take lot of space.

This is not having scan/copy functions. (that is the reason why it is cheap and lightweight)
This printer doesn't have Wireless connectivity etc. This connects only using USB with Windows OS based computer.
Print clarity and quality is satisfactory. Yet to explore further.

Right now, I'm yet to check how long cartridge goes on. will post based on experience further.",4
Pathetic. Horrible experience. It actually deserves Zero star rating. Do not buy this item. Total waste of money and effort.,1
From the first day unable to print in color. Asking to replace color cartridge... printing only with black... and even tough using brand new best quality A4 paper... paper getting stuck up and crippled... a total mess... Also they are so tricky that... there is no option for return.... The HP CC number provided is incorrect or does not exist..... A BIG NO from my side.... total disappointment....,1
"I wasted money for this product. From the day 1 it is not working. Complete unhappy with Amazon who is such non working products and making customer suffer. Due to some medical emergency not able to report the issue to Amazon. Request Amazon to look into this issue and take the product back and refund my money back.
Once I receive my money back will order new printer.
Waiting for Amazon response in my query.",1
"Unboxing took me 5 minutes. Physical installation took another 2 minutes.
Printer is light. Decent looking. IT does not scan.
Cartridge installation is a little tricky for the first time.
Software installation took me 20 minutes on a macbook with big sur.
I advise you to get the drivers from hp webpage.
Black and white printing is fast enough and acceptable.
Color printing is slow,it is not accurate.
Also after 2-3 simple color prints, i noticed the ink tank was down by 10%.

If you are looking for a quick fix, this is it.
I print out maybe 5 docs a month.
Im happy, this saves me the hassle of relying on someone else for a printout you know.

THANKS HP!

PS - If you have a newer macbook you will need to find a ub c to usb a converter without which this wont establish a physical connection.

Also there is no a4 sheet accompanying this printer not even for test. So make sure you source your stash. else you will have a new printer but no pages to print it on.",5
"Never buy HP printers. I did this mistake 3 times. Wasted a tonne money on cartridges and repair. The actual problem is ""HP DISABLES YOUR PRINTER remotely"" if you ever use a cartridge more than once. Especially if you refill it. They want us to buy their ridiculously expensive tiny cartridges every month! If we don't use different ones, they disable your printer. It happened to me twice while using hp inkjet printer and DeskJet printer.
I bought this printer in August 2020 and it's disabled in September 2020! Due to lockdown I used a refil ink and bam!
The printer was printing with the refill ink offline.
As soon as I went online with printer connected to my laptop, it won't print again!!
I haven't registered with HP. I thought if I don't register this won't happen. But still happened. Now I have a light blinking printer with me, which won't print.
Hp is the worst.",1
only power on but dont accepting any print command,1
"I find the printer a bit problematic while using and even implementing.
A lot of things to be taken care of while using and installing.",3
"Total waste of money, cartridges seems like already used or have low amount of ink printed about 30 pages only with black ink and 5-8 with colour ink, after shows cartridge empty.",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Been using for three months now.
Pros.
Excellent ease of installation
Printable from mobile (wired connection)
Comes with two cartridge one black and one colour
Cheapest printer with brand value
Cons.
High cost of printing
Combined cost of cartridge is almost equal to printer (About 1300/-)
PS. Have also printed on sticker paper for labels. Initially it didnot print well. But after tweaking the settings (mainly paper quality (select photo paper in settings and print quality best) and placing creasefree paper, obtained good quality coloured labels on A4 sticker paper.
Overall good buy if you use occasionally. Not for daily rough use. (The same had cost Rs. 50! from local market).
Good option if you don't want to go out for print outs under the present pandemic conditions.",5
"This is a very good and compact printer to use. But once the OEM cartridge becomes empty, getting the 805 replacement cartridge is very difficult. I ordered the 805 cartridge in amazon, but received a wrong 803 cartridge. So, I ordered the ink refill from amazon and is running fine.

Other than that this is a very good printer for home use.",2
"I bought for around 60 pages and it printed. And I left it without usage and then refilled after 3 months and it was printing fine, but since I did not use continuously every week the ink got dried up and it does not print properly.

Hence, if you will use the printer everyday or at least once every week, but it else do not buy this printer. This could be applicable for all ink jet printers",1
"Pros-
1. Easy to unpack and install
2. Clear and good quality print.
3. Printer cost is pocket friendly

Cons-
1. Can only print and not photocopy or scan.
2. No option for bluetooth or wifi
3. High maintainance cost, ie, the cartridge costs around 750rs!",3
Product doesn’t work with MacOS. But the built quality and everything else is outstanding if you’re a windows or Linux user. The,3
Poor waste of money don't buy it's take only 30 print after that ink is finished.....and then need to buy ink....the cost of ink is high 800 rupees it's worth for 30 print this much cost not good not effective waste of money,1
Good product at this price but customer care of HP is pathetic I had an issue at the time of installation they were uanble to resolve and then I browsed on net and resolved it myself otherwise it's a good product,4
"Easy to install and easy to use but print quality is very low and even in low quality you can print only 8-10 pages. After printing 10 pages it will show you that ""cartridges very low"" please install new cartridge also will stop taking print command until you install new cartridge or refill ink. It costs approximately ₹140 per color page.",1
Very simple to use. Nice colours. The only thing is that u can't print via OTG from Android device simply using HP app. It's only supporting WiFi. Hence I have to install third party software. I purchased it during lockdown two months before and printed approx 50 pages of my kids school assignment.Rest is ok.,5
Not as clear as I expected it to be. But you can use it for normal purposes such as regular black prints. I was able to make hardly 50 black prints and cartridge is empty now.,2
Don't buy this product. 803 cartridge will only print 20-25 copies. And new cartridge price is 1200/- which will again print only 20-25 copies. So per page printing cost will be more than 50 rupees.,1
There is no issue in printer. It work fantastic and clean print .NOTE:- the single cartridge can print most probably 100 pages or less than that bcz i hardly printed some of my pdf pages countly 60to 70 pages.. and my black cartridge is empty now its been a 4 days from the purchage.. so use it wisely or use ink bottle to refill it rather than buying a new cartridge it will be more costlier than printer itlsef THANK U❤️,5
I bought this printer 2 years ago in 2019 for only 999₹. It came with a small cartridge. I was able to print 60 - 70 pages after that black colour was dried. And all text printed pages were gray text pages. But overall for 999₹ I wouldn't complain. I had some trouble with installation in my windows laptop. But I was able to overcome that easily.,4
"Amazon fastest delivery,,which really impressed me.... this is my third printer from HP although earlier one was high end laserjet ... But this printer for beginners hp1112 is not good ... Single papers always get stuck in it ... ... And need to reprint again... Why a home occasional user will put full paper bundle inside the printer... Rest it is very easy to install ... The driver for the printer is online available..... But hp should have kept an installation CD in the package as this printer is for beginners not professionals.
But still in this little amount of money ...worth ...
Amazon rocks ...",4
Build Quality is low. I have been using HP f370 since 2006 and that has no issue till now and had replaced cartridge only once. I got this printers delivery today(11 Mar 2020) and with 2 hours had to request a refund as it printed only 30 pages on black only fast draft (F370 used to print more than 160) and start showing lines and then an error came up popping showing cant print I restarted it showed ink cartridge empty. it may be on sale or cheaper but its later costs are high. don't waste time on this buy other HP products.,1
Printing quality is too good. Consumes more Cartridge ink. It's only printer. No scanner and cannot xerox,4
Its a good simple product who can use home print easily. I think this will be the cheapest home printer affordable to many .Just printing only...But thats more than enough for this much amount.Two cartridges are also there.,4
"Very very slow printing.
I had HP 1112 printer( bought for Rs. 1450 before pandemic). It was ok but now I am using this HP 1212 & it's super slow, even in draft mode printing.

They made it intentionally slow & inferior to promote sale of expensive printers.",1
"Copy pasting this as I am also having the same problem! please do not purchase this printer, initially it works smoothly. I purchased it in 2019.i also printout only 10-15 copies. Now its not working as shows continuously light blink and did not take print from computer. I have checked it various OS, other laptops,desktop also. But it wont print, only continuously blinking light. I asked to my friend who purchase same printer before 1 year. He is also facing the same problem. Even he exchanged new printer from thana office becaz his printer is in warranty. The new printer also shows same problem after 3-4 months. And this problem is not repaired, we also given for repaired but it doesnt solve.",5
Printing quality is good... But printing cost is very high... Because cartridges have a very high price... Means 750/- for one... If u buy two... U almost pay the price of the printer... And the ink level decrease very fast... So not recommended at all...,2
Don't buy because catrige is not working after refill.. those only for one time usage.. and rate of new one to purchase is not economical... Thank you..,1
"HP lost a court case but still persists in selling you these printers and cartridges with denial of your ownership over them. By misusing technology they discourage you from refilling and continuing to use the same ink cartridges for long. Their printers and cartridges are technologically designed to block such usage. You can't use them as if you owned them. It's as if you borrowed or leased or rented them from HP, with a pledge to suffer and feel frustrated for as long as the printer is with you.",1
"I was looking for a printer for occasionall use. This one fit the budget. Make is not so sturdy so handle with care. On first installation didn't work blinking lights. Did some troubleshooting but no luck , I tried to return but no option have to check with HP support only. Amazon just sells and no support whatever. Luckily it worked next day and using it since then. I take occasionall print out for my kids worksheet so no issue there.",4
"Decent printer at very competitive price. For the price the speed and print quality is very decent.
Durability I will only know after a few months - but has worked well in 2-3 months of low frequency use.
Value for money buy",4
Running cost very costly. Color catridge at rs 1200 prints 120 copy ( 5% coverage print which implies only 6-7 A4 size full photo print.). Better add another 4000 and by single function inktank printers.,2
If you plan to print 20-30 page per month then go for it. its low cost and does its job. only con is printer ink is costly which is situation for all inkjet printers you can lower this cost if you refill the cartridge with ink there are kits available at amazon for this . Definately recommended if you are low on budget,5
I did a lot of research before selecting this model. Its good for home/student printing requirements. The quality of print is ok considering the price of 2k of the printer. The colour print out is decent. Not sure of the economical piece coz I did not calculate so much and yet to refill. But for my kid's assignment this works well and easy to setup plus easy to print. I think it is good value for the money. I have been using it for a month and works absolutely fine.,5
"i purchased this printer with 2 years ONSITEGO warantee. Both are useless. Printer does not recognise genuine cartridge. ONSITEGO does not recognise warantee, when contacted. I have another HP printer which has similiar problem. I advise, never buy HP printer.",1
"I brought this printer on 29/06/2019, aftr unboxing i checked the power suppy on the printer, they power does not turns on, i saw various youtube video and manual booklet to solve, but the problm didt get solved, soo i was trying the troll free number for 3 days continously to talk with customer support, but the number is not reachable, still now my product is not working, waste of time and money",1
Nice,5

Dont Buy This product Very Bad product and Policy Also Bad,i wil Taken This product on 8th jan
but first 10 days good working after that means yesterday it wil hang not working print also not good but checked with mechanic and his stated this product not working...amazon given to me a bad product...plz dont buy this product...",1
"I got slow speed isue, then I tried to costomer care very difficult to get costomer care because no direct option to call costomer care only after selecting nombers after call , After many failour last got costomer care after that they will become very helpful to solve the problem , by phone by their dirrection solved the slow speed problem .The reason for problem is black ink is finished so printer worked very slowly solution for this problem is 1. Only use any one cartridge which have ink, 2nd solution is if we use both ink cartridge then make shour both cartridge have ink.
After that they say they approve ink cartridge only not approve ink refill or not guarante will not get.
Product name : DeskJet 1112 , prise :2000 rupees
Ink prise from shop 803 code black :750 and color have more then 1000 rupees",3
"Works well with Mac OS , Easy to install !!

Received one colour and black cartridge with printer !!

Print Quality is okay !!

So for I have printed around 50 A4 colour pages seems colour cartridge going to finish need to refill , because new cartridge costs half the price of printer !!",3
"This product doesnot meet my requirement.I requested for return which not been honoured.
Appreciate to accept my request for return of this item.
Please do needful.",1
"I purchased one year ago after using I am says thanks for Amazon for giving this best product and also seller , it's best for office purpose daily 10 to 20 pages printing purpose , I printed 30 page s instantly the printing quality never changed , need to replace ink after printing 40 pages
Easy to install on any device, computer, mobile, etc",5
"I think this product is value for money. I got the product in good packing and pretty quickly. For the price I have paid, the quality was decent.
The biggest pro is how light and compact the printer is. I was specifically looking for a very small printer for occassional printing, this fits the bill perfectly
The biggest con is that, it is not easy to do two side prints, it takes a while to print few sheets if you want to do back to back prints, as it is very tedeous to cycle the papers.
The print quality is not very good, but decent
I am yet to figure out the printing costs.",3
"I bought this printer for 2k and as i said in the title, it's a legit pocket friendly printer. For those who are looking for a printer for their start up it's one of the best out there.

Pros -
Easy to install
User friendly
Print quality
Print timing
Size, easy to fit in your setup
Style
Sound

Cons -
Nothing as such, just the outer packaging of the product cud've been better.

It's a 5/5 idk why there were so many negative comments about this printer.

Kudos HP!",5
"In the price this product comes for, its a great one. Works fine, good print quality. Awesome for home use especially kids projects, sample test papers, and normal routine print outs. Nerver forget, you would pay less than 2k for this. Liked it 👍",5
This printer has been working perfectly since the day I received it. It’s easy to install with a nice print quality. We’ve been taking over 50 prints per day and never faced any kind of issue with this.,5
"Product was all good.. Had some problems with installation. Coz I was using printer for first time..
I recommend this printer only for small use.. Printing 60-80 pages per month.. For more than that you should go for little costly variables.. Printing charge is high for this one
The thing that dissapointed me is the packing.. When I saw the package I thought the printer would have damaged. Package was already one side opened.. It's not my first experience with Amazon.. Nowadays most of my orders are with torn packages..",4
"Size bigger than 1000/1100 series without additional function.
You can remove the colour ink and print only with the black ink.
Some other printers need both inks to be present even to print B&W",4
Printer is all good and gives me all satisfaction for my work but there is one thing every printer needs a software and there was not cd or any instructions about the software and drives which needed to be installed to use it i will like if you fix my problem.,3
"HP - the brand name itself refers the quality. Works good, vibrant prints on photo sheets. Dust cover is not supplied with this model, some other models come with dust covers. Very good compact budget printer for home use",5
It is better to replace the entire printer than its cartridges. Those tiny bastards actually cost more than the printer itself. You’d still be at a profit. Damn HP’s cartridge policy!,1
"Printer doesn't work with Linux or Mac. Replaced it once but the problem persists . Now trying to use after holidays, again it didn't work and return window has also closed. Wasted money.",1
"A simple fuss-free printer. If your requirement is to only have a printer at home for occasional prints, this printer would do justice. Prints are clear, it’s easy to install and the initial cartridge I received is still able to deliver good prints. So far, I have printed close to 40pages with predominant black and sprinkling of color texts in the documents. Overall, good product and recommended for normal home use. I purchased the printer at a very competitive price of 1599 from amazon during the sale period.",4
"I went for this printer for home, expecting to have low cost printer fitting the purpose. The promise from HP is 120 pages for black and white cartridges. But it drained within 50 pages. That makes the cost per page of print to INR 10, which is high cost print. This is not economically viable.",2
"I was reluctant to go for this but the cost of the unit was good enough to justify not going for a pricier model. Print quality is good, cartridge cost may cause some headache later on (will try refill/ will cross that bridge when I get to that). I intend to use it for like 5-10 prints per month max & it should serve me well for that purpose - convenience over cost.",4
"Light weight,ink will drain fastly but the quality is good,just bought new ink bottle 135ml from HP(6000 pages),class look..good for home use,if it has a wifi it would be extraordinary.thank you amazon and hp.",5
The original black cartridge finished in just 60 prints against what's claimed in the product page. Plus the black cartridge refill is very costly. Buying this printer will be a very costly deal so not recommended to buy.,1
"Fantastic for few prints in a week or so, you don't have to rush to nearest printing or documentation centre. Very handy, easy to use and value for money. Don't know about the cartridge replacement cost but as of now, 100 marks out of 100.",5
"first order of this printer get serial number mismatching with warranty slip .

after exchange first printer i got printer of which original warranty expire on hp official website and also 2 months expire it’s extended warranty . so i got exchanged printer 14 months old .",1
I love everything about this printer. The customer support assistance of HP is superb. Best part this printer is very affordable and good for home or small business usage. You will get black & white as well as colour prints of good quality. Loved the product.,5
Very prominent colour photographs and black and white documents print out is getting but hp original ink cartridges are too much costlier to refill very frequently.,5
"Great Product in Cheap price
Small in Size , light weight ,easy to Install ,2 cartridge free with this Printer colour and Black
Good for Daily purpose Use .hp 1212",5
This is a low price product. The ink got over with just 26 pages of print. The cartridges cost me more than the printer price. Should anyone buy this product? In my opinion HP is fooling people by selling this printer. Please dont buy this product.,1
It might be easy to use but it's ink got dry very quick if you've this printer in unused condition for 30 days then ink got dry and you've yo purchase another cartridges. New cartridges costs approximately 1200. I was buy a cartridges for once thereafter i am not doing any prints in this printer.,5
"I probably print things about twice a year at home. So I opted for this. Super cheap, flimsy as expected but easy to use and install. I would not recommend this for anyone who prints more than I do. It's only for those who print very very occasionally.",3
"Print equality is very good
But one star ⭐...
Completely waste of money.
After 15 days... printing speed is 10 min per side of the page.
Also, cost per print is very high...never bye this... completely waste of money",1
"When the paper is being printed, it makes a weird addictive sound like nashik dhol. Makes me wanna dance! P",4
The print per page cost is high. Don't expect it to work more than 2 years I have had the previous model 1112 which didn't work 2 years. However its the cheapest printer available after 1112,4
Please don't buy if you want to prints more number of pages.....650-750cartrudge price can print only 100-120 pages....completely cost ineffective,3
"The printer had problems pulling in paper right from the beginning, but I could manage by manually adjusting the paper every time I took a print-out....after 9 months it stopped working completely....when I checked the warranty status on the HP site, it states that the warranty is expired because the warranty start date is shown as ""January 2020"" whereas I purchased the item only in July 2020",1
"Never buy this product. One catridge is one-time use only.

Trust me the worst product ever. Buy a printer with refill tank.

The product telling refillable but after refill the software willnot detect.

Then tried all, by pressing 20 second off for power button, then unplug it.
Every thing means everything.

If everytime I will buy a cartridge then my print and maintenance cost will be Rs-5 plus.",1
"Light weight
Easy to install - it comes without CD, gp online 123.hp.com download the file for 1110, that what u get when u search for 1112 printer, but it solves ur purpose.
Cartridges are good, i was able to print approx 150 pages with those free small cartridges.",5
Ink finished in 10 prints only. The cartridges were out of ink very quickly. Something is wrong with the printer. Lets start from delivery. The packaging was not done from Amazon which was surprising to me. Installation was quite teasing task as it took time. The main problem came when I printed some pages and ink finished. 2000 price with ink finishing so quickly. I think one should go for better options,3
Now I know why the seller was selling this product at a discounted rate. Hp company had already discontinued the production of the compatible catridge for this printer (HP 803 black cartridge) back in January 2019.,1
"It's a very good printer by Hp, if you are students & want to purchase for use it at home then you should must buy this product..very good quality of printing u can print on both sides of paper..only thing is after 200 to 300 page print ink will finish and you will have to refill for re-use & I think it's valid for all type of inkjet printer..so this printer is best for buy at this price..Happy and thanks Hp",4
Works like a charm. Connected to my PC through USB cable and does the job pretty well. Didn’t want a scanner as nowadays that function is available on all smartphones so why shell out extra money for the same.,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Worthy according to the price ! Setup is also easy 😉 from hp drivers .com",5
HP1112 sold by Appario is a USED product that DOES NOT WORK. We have recvd the previous customer's bill in the box!!!! The box and manuals were soiled. Pls do not buy this printer its a waste of money and time !!!,1
"Purchased the product sometime early this year for my office. Had barely used it when lockdown hit.Subsequently used it again in August. In total it has been used for 2 cartridges refills max. Stopped working after that.For the last 2 months we have been following up with HP for service. Engineer visited and examined the piece more than a month back. Since then the only response we have been getting from them, is that part is not available.",1
Very good product at this price. But when you print in normal it comes with some white lines but in high quality no problem and the print colour in photo paper wipes when you rube with finger i dont know for what it is happening may be colour is not good or the photo paper is not good. I ordered a printer colour then lets see what happens.,4
"Black cartridge got over in printing less than 40 pages. Never expected this kind of a performance. Pls don't go on the low price of this product, it doesn't seems wrothy even to buy for the purpose of home usage. Writing it with in 2 weeks of buying and only 3 times usage during this period.",1
"The box was so damaged that the moment I picked it up, the printer fell from below. The printer however was fine. the coloured ink was working fine and printing flawlessly. The black ink was dried up. Nothing inside the box was in separate packaging. I chose to replace it immediately. Horrible packaging. It felt as if someone had used it before and replaced it. There were scratches on the printer and it was a little dirty too.",1
"Its cartridge cost is more than printer cost..
Max 100copies ... But quality of print is very very good",5
Buy this only if you have a Mac or Windows machine. This doesn't work with Ubuntu. I confirmed this with HP Support,1
"Excellent printer for home usage. Quite portable and the ink usage is decent in my opinion.
Printed about 100-120 pages, I have ~35% ink (black) and ~75% (color) remining . Mostly draft option was used for printing.
30% Color
70% B&W",5
Good product at reasonable price,4
"Nice Printer.
I buy only for CISS install which is convert to INKJET TO INKTANK printer.
Nice Print Quality.
Thank you HP",5
"Useless printer. Cost is less but not worth spending even this much. Cost per page is too high. I have just few prints, cartridge is over. Not user friendly at all. Better spend much and get a WiFi printer using bottle ink, cost of printing in thoe is less",2
Good quality product but its ink gets finished in few prints. I had printed only 10 documents under which its ink gets finished. I had order another ink bottle for this only. My time got wasted due to insufficient ink.,5
"Don't expect diamond in cost of coal. Price & quality is good. Best for students, home, and basic commercial purposes. But it's best according to price. You can use through mobile OTG connection but need upgrade android version mobile &hp app",4
"I bought this at an offer of Rs. 1500/- it’s okay for this price. Because the refill also costs the same amount as the printer.

The drivers were extremely difficult to instal. And I had to reinstall then after not using this for over 2 weeks.",3
"Per page print cost is very very high,

Pages gets jammed frequently (needs good thick paper minimum 70gsm)

Only plus is the price at which we get it,
Use till its usable, then new again",3
I have printed only 5 colors after that ink got over and black total print I have taken around 15. Worst calculation and expensive ink better print outside that is less costly.,1
Worst product on amazon....this is such a basic one...useless printer it has seriously no use...There is no return option also given to this useless product..,1
"Good product for 2000...does your job... Print quality is far behind good.. Take it only for children projects.

Pairing it with laptop is tricky",4
An amazing printer for people who do not require a large amount of printing. Ideal for home use. Also the cartridges that come with it are test cartridges. They don’t last,4
"Seen lot of bad reviews on this. Still bought it as it's cheap and found to be good. Although cartridge price is around 700/-, but that's normal. The printer prints fast and quality is good. Can be used for assignment printing, simple photo printing, notes.",5
"Dont buy if you using for commercial purpouse but if you take 7 prints per month then ok
Higly not recommended ...very expensive cartridge",1
The seller sent me with the expired black cartridge. I could not print more than 5 pages. It was just cheating. better go for toner saving printer. The cost of each catrige is 800 rupees and capacity is 150 pages. per page cost is around 10 rupees. Not worth for money.,1
"It's worked till 20days
Than it not worked hp service and Amazon not give proper response
Amazon sales defected products to their customers and making fools",1
I am cheated. The catridge which came with the printer didn't work even once. And if you go to buy the cartridge. It costs the same as printer. So BEWARE!,1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Print quality issue

I have given my notes to print but after printing 15 sides it is not printing and also when I have opened my package I saw that the cartilage was opened (shared same with pics for reference)

Now I returning this waste product

Worst experience till now in online product..",1
"Don't get fooled by the low price of the printer. It's not economical at all and you will end up buying a cartridge every month, even if you print only low volumes. I take only my daughter's assignments - may be 50 prints a month and the ink levels are at 10-20% by the end of the month.",1
"the print quality is good for 2 pages, after that it will ask to refill the cartridge, even after refill the cartridge . no print will come only white paper will be printed. The cheap product will be like this only. avoid buying this, i regret buying this.",1
"Just after 30 days of order the printer becomes dysfunctional.

That's is not all, contacting support revealed that the serial number on the package is different from the inner printer.
That is compromised integrity, trusting amazon for spending with less and less",1
"Overall printer works really good. Since it's been only a day that I started using this, would rather wait a few more days.

Couple of things to note

Loading catridges and paper instructions must be very clear. It is time taking to understand.",4
"Product is ok.. Not happy with the performance.. Whenever 5-6 papers left, paper get jammed... First time I am not happy with the HP Printer performance..",3
"Printer I purchase in month of March 2020 it hardly worked for 2months and then it stopped working ,I changed ink cartridge still its not working ,as per the toll number mentioned in description i called up for service,the service number is invalid,so little disappointment with the printer.I hope please check the product before purchase.",3
"within 2month cartridge is not working took only 30 printouts(black), tried for refilling also not working ..error code notifies to change the cartridge..printer cost 1999rs ..cartridge cost more than 1600rs (780rs black and 850rs color)..so think of it and buy",1
"But strangely it prints last page first in place of first page. PDF page printing ommits many lines while printing...
Anyone knows any setting to print every thing in the page ?",5
Worst quality. Difficult to setup and get just 20 pages to a cartridge. Could not believe such poor product from HP,1
"I have received it on time, fit and finish is good, don't know how it performs because you don't get software cd with it. I will post the update once it is used.",2
Very useful for home use. Printing is very good. Even printed a group photo which came out nice,5
The power button is clunky.no other word for it. I dont know how long it will last. Also installing the ink cartridge is scary as the thing doesnot smoothly slot in place . Scared that the clip that holds it will break before it goes in.,1
I personally would prefer to use products that does one job well to doing multiple tasks in a mediocre manner. This printer is easy to configure and use though the driver doesn't seem to support choosing monochrome / color when printing which the all in one counterpart does. Otherwise it's pitch perfect for printing and so rated all stars.,4
"I like the product for its elegant look, compact in size, cost effectiveness and user-friendly installation process. Suitable for my limited and occasional use.",4
I got this printer yesterday and after printing 15-20 ink levels are showing low.i am returning the product.. Highly disappointed. 🙄,1
"I have purchased a HP deskjet printer1112 from Amezon online .
After receiving this printer , it was not working properly then i called to HO customer care , then i came to know that the serial number ia registered on different customer. It means Amezon cheated me. He handed me a wrong Printer.

I request my full amount at the earliest.",1
Small printer good for taking printout for kids. Easy to access. Only drawback is costly cartridge. Other than that everything is fine so far.,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Printer had ink smudges, cables were loose, ink cartridges were without protective packing or the HP standard orange color protective tape, broken and incomplete hard foam (thermocol) packing, packing box had missing areas which indicate repacking. Outer Amazon box used to cover all these signs",1
We r not able to take printout after merely six months only from purchase..writing review after more than 1 year of purchase.,4
Print quality is excellent. It is so easy to operate that my 7 year old son takes printout without my help,5
"The cartridge that comes with printer, prints no more than 50 Pages, then you need to replace, Only single use cartridge, Waste of money, don't buy",1
Excellent printing easy installation and easy to use but no driver cd along with this box package little broken but no damge to machine overall very good product from hp,5
It damaged after 2 year of use. I recovered my money by using it. But i will say that it is useful to only those who prints 10 to 20 pages per month or less.,2
It is light weight..easy to carry while travelling along with your lap top.. Easy to install. The only problem is ink finished soo soon.. And no ink filler can fill it.. I bought a ink filler but it didnt worked.. I bought new ink catridges and the ink is very expensive.. When you buy ink catridges but tricolor + black.. Otherwise its a good product..,4
"Just the day after the return window closed, the ink finished. I have barely taken 30 print outs (one-sided) as yet and the black ink is over already. I would not recommend it. The print quality is good but it consumes way too much ink. Replacement for the ink will cost me INR500. 30 black and white print outs for INR500. You do the math.",1
"Very less number of prints with the installed cartridges. I must have not printed more than 50-60 b/w pages. And 30-40 color.

I got a refill, which just worked for a few days and now the printer refuses to accept the cartridge. New cartridges are more than the printer cost!

Don't buy this!",1
"The product is good.
But don't buy it, otherwise you will repent.
But the cost of printing is too much.
I bought original cartridge for Rs 700 and it provided only 20 prints. I can't believe that Rs 35 per page print, that is black and white.",1
"nicely packaged when delivered. checked warrenty through qr code and serial no and felt happy to find it intact.
there was no installation cd in the box but found the drivers while checking warrenty online.
had a hard time figuring out where to put cartilages but managed to pull cartilage box from corner after a while and rest of the installation was pretty easy
feel happy to advise others for small scale use.",4
Error getting sometimes in printing. Cartages is print 60 per page he is written 120 pages,2
Very nice experience in the test of time to explore new ways of learning and smart ways of learning and smart ways of learning and smart ways of learning and smart,5
Poor quality printer. Price is its only advantage. Ink dries out within days if unused. Printer catridge no longer available. Dont buy.,1
VFM for printing kids school work during covid days. It's much better n cheaper to fill ink using sringes than buying expensive Hp refills,4
"This printer is a gem. Particularly if you are on Linux like me, you will love printing to the HP 1112 with HPLIP software suite.",5
"Best suited for kid's school printing, the print copies come cheaper than what it may cost you in the market. It's a good printer at reasonable price, price being lowest amongst other online & offline options",3
the ink jet printers cartridge finishes in less than 40 to 50 prints and the refill amount is as good as buying the same printer again..i suggest one goes for laser printers to inkjet ones.,2
"I was brought on Oct 2019 smoothly working but , some problem on colur but I brought on RS1000 blinking problem was common problem it will solve essay just remove the dust on the chip of cartridge and fit on there and close and open the door constantly while the blinking stop .",3
Even the demo cartridge printed 20+ sheets. No difference in print quality in this printer and all in ones. Infact who needs all in ones now as our smartphones can do the most,5
The only reason this is not 5 -star is that i was fooled into believing that this printer will not come with catridges due to the option while purchasing.,4
"Got it cheap and functions well. The photo prints are excellent quality. The cartridges are very costly. So, not suitable for high volume printing",5
"I know, it's not an economical printer if you are printing tons of pages but for light weight stuff, it's awesome. Even color prints are sharp and crisp.

Very satisfied.",5
"This printer is great but when i buy it, it prints only 10 papers, so i think you should check the cartridges properly otherwise all the work is great.",3
The print quality is good and the print speed is fast but the cartridge doesn't last long. I had hardly printed 20 25 pages when the black ink ran out,3
"I bought this printer in June 2020, it was working well initially, now it stopped working. I am not able to solve this using HP virtual assistant, its a time consuming task, still not resolved. Print cost is high compared to printing outside. For low- medium print requirements, dont buy this.",2
"Best budget colour printer for personal printing.. just go for it.

Initially i was in dilemma but the performance broke out all the doubts. Printer is little bit delicate. Must be handled smoothly.",5
"Packaging is not good. Mfg date, serial no. tampered. After installation the printer is not working.",1
go for it its good and the best thing of this printer is value for money and another thing was dont worry about catridge i know that is costly but you can refill the same catridge by buying ink which you can get at a minimal price thank you......,5
Like is always as u r getting a brand quality of HP and there is one dislike point that u have to active the printer online otherwise u cant use it only on adobe reader for direct print otherwise it is excellent,5
"Bought the printer, set it up, started printing and the black catridge got depleted in just 40 pages. The refill is way too costly! Dont know what to do with it now!!",1
product is good but Amazon service is worst. 1 star is for Amazon not for product.,1
"Great printer for a best price!! Nice print quality, easy to install, but Amazon packaging was not used, only it came with the brand's box, but there was no damage, If the seller packs it along with the amazon packaging it will be well and good! 👍",5
"Got this printer at Rock bottom price ,but realized later the cartridges are costly ,printer cost 1,400-1600 but ink cost 900/- ,better select a printer where cartridges ink cost is less",4
"Since you getting it for so cheap, you can expect the same quality and performance in return.",3
Very useful and the price also cheap. Good for home use. No need to spend money for unimportant things. I used to print 10 pages per week. So this is enough for me.,5
Very Bad Service .... Received Empty and Damaged Color cartridge....,1
"No no no no no no no no no no no no or suffer suffer suffer suffer suffer siffer suffer!
I think you got what i meant to say .",1
"This is not sufficient for kids printouts. If you need to print once in a while then it is fine.
Cartridge is getting empty after few prints",2
"Nothing to dislike.
However HP should also supply a durable cover to protect from dust etc.
I managed to install myself and comfortable usage.",5
Have been using since last 1 month. Good for small amount of printage use. Cartridge gets dried after printing max 25 pages(both side print). Have refilled the cartridge and using it. No major issue except the short durability of the inks.,5
"The product is not functioning properly , so we need urgent service for that. Looking for your cooperation.
Thanks",1
Best printer for home use .I bought this under deal at just ₹999 out of which get approx ₹700 cash back.really good products for limited use .,5
"So, this printer uses cartridge no. 803. It is no more available in online stores and even in HP website it is discontinued. Although the printer does what it claims to do, but what to do without any new print cartridge?",3
Pretty good for the price. The OTG compatibility is quite an asset because with a few codecs one can use this printer to print files from an android smartphone.,5
First day I'm really disappointed for buying this .it is too hard to install in laptop but through otg cable it is easy to install in Android mobile.i ordered 1112 series but I received 1110 series wid the duplicate lable.packing and delivery is good.. performance is average.,3
"Printer is highly cost effective as low as 1 Rs/page (B &W),if you use it with ink sold by whitesky or similar brand.
otherwise setup cartridge gave almost
65 B & W prints.",4
"It's very bad product.. it's not printing properly anything.. it's called as Color printer but unable to print color . I take for my personal use to print color documents. But it's not printing. Please don't take this printer 😭😠😡.

Very bad product I ever seen",1
Very good printer in this price... Only HP able to do it ... Excellent ☺️,5
"Print quality is not so good, and the cartridge went low after printing almost 6- 8 printouts. after that it started printing only with pink color. so sad to see a product like this from HP",1
Print quality is good...but it consume a lot of ink....The HP 803 small cartridge (black and white) yeilds about 25-30 pages not kore than that... a little dissatisfied :'(,2

"good product, but cartridge is very costly , company making money in cartridge",3

Simple to config and use. Prints are good. Best for home usage.,5
Missing cartridge compartment inside the printer and am helpless because am unable to contact either the seller ( Amazon ) or HP ( the manufacturer ). I am being redirected through virtual boards that are unable to provide a solution to my problem. Please be careful and read the fine print carefully before you buy any product thru these companies.,1
"Print quality is average, handy printer to have at home, but the cartridge life is pathetic. Doesnt give as many prints as mentioned.",3
Paper loading mechanism is not good. Paper always got struck and not loaded properly. Need to do it manually evey time. Due to this printing on both sides of the paper is a tough job with this printer.,2
Product works fine for 4 months but one refill without using original cartage it's stop working,3
"Software cd drive not provided, and online software not working with Window 7. so useless product it is. Amazon has careless employees",2
"Awesome printer. But always it getting stuck , but print quality is good",4
"Good printer under 2000. Good design, light weight. But as expected printing speed is slow as it is inkjet printer .",4
Only 20 pages very costly,1
"Its poor for regular or more use.
As it shows its price , at this cost you will get the kind of product which only give you a dull results.
It give only a few 10s prints then after ink will be empty which cost you more that you will get a print from outside store.",1
Very good 😊 for house and office use but got non defectove product in second time 😔😔,5
"The ink finished after like 2 prints . Waste of money, used once and it has been piling dust since last 2 years . Buy a lazer printer instead.",1
This is a defective product. It regularly create problems colour mismatch print and while printing sometime the matter is not printed on it and half printed paper is out. So please replace it.,1
"Very bad printer cartridge is very small.
It doesn't take command quickly. You have have to aware while giving command otherwise it will print previous documents.",1
this product is looking good from outer side...but from inside it is using very cheap material.after printing 30 normal sheets its stopped working..now it do not accpet a single paper on if it accpets paper it stuck inside.ink is not long lasting.,1
"Everything is okay.. it's good for home and small office print.. if anyone wants to print daily, then should not go for this one.. or they must have ink to refill it..
Other than that amazing product.. easy to install and easy to use..",5
Printer worked only for 10 prints then after it’s not working at all..,1
Worst product anyone could buy ever. Printer head doesn't support thr weight of both the printing heads. Either one can use black or colored but not together.,1
Print quality is good but the cartage which we get with it can only print 80 page and cost of new cartage is uneconomical so for student who need printer for assignment purpose this printer is wastage of money,3
Stopped working after 200 prints...even after refill...,1
Product is very nice... easy to print but installation is difficult.. too long to install... in booklet given website is difficult to understand..,5
The printer cost was Rs. 1799 on Amazon. HP56 Cartridge required for is very costly (Rs. 2719 on HP portal) and not even available in the market now. Think before you ink.,1
"Cost of printer is less but cost of printing is high nearby 7rs/page. One cartridge can print only near 100 pages but it's cost is 750rs. Only printer is cheap, suitable for people who print less than 5 pages a day",3

"No proper demo by the company after sales and cartridge was dry .
No response from hp even after conveyed",1
This Printer Ink Cartridge you can't refill. You need to purchase again this. This cost around 800 rs. So the paper print coast is 6 rs per one paper. Don't tempt buy looking hat Printer prices. I already lost money and deceived been,2
original cartridges which only print 100 pages cost 600 rs - only buy if you're willing to gamble with DIY cartridge refilling,3

"Ok .......but only for individual purpose, can't be afforded for any type of office as ink lasts only about 100-110 pages. And the ink costs much ..... Think twice before buying it as it will cost you after every 100 pages...",3
Nice and good printer in below 2k .Good for daily use and school assignments.,4
It is compatible with Pc... Laptop as well as Phone. The print is not good as expected and also ink finishes to fast. Good product to use at home only.,3

1112 deskjet is easy to install and easy to use. Print Quality is also good. If you want to purchase a printer for school projects and occasional printing. You could go for deskjet 1112. Also remember to register your product with hp.,5
"Don't buy this product.
The cartridge supportable to this (803) printer generates very low yield.

Good printer . Installing takes much time . Easy to use but dont know about ink usage,4
Don't buy it. That's all I can say. It is a cdm in the form of printer. You'll have to put money again and again into this printer.,2
"This is excellent printer for home use...Print quality is nice...Installation is simple...But only one disadvantage-i.e-Consumes lot of ink and not for printing larger amount of prints at a time...
Otherwise Its excellent for home/personal use✌",4
Ink cost is higher than the printer... I but it worth 1500 and original ink cost is showing 1600+ lol...and after using bottle ink my cartridge was damaged fully and it's showing unrecognised after putting in cartridge bucket ...,3
It is a good printer for home use. Printing quality good. Easy to install and use.,5
Though printer is gud but it consume too much ink and i got defective cartridge where new black cartridge for Rs. 900. Here the cost of printer is low but the cost of cartridge both black and colour is more then the cost if printer. Not worth of money. Think twice before purchasing this product.,2
Product is not good because no give me printer driver CD . Not operate easy.,2

Sometimes the printer is pulling 2 or 3 papers at a time.",2

Overall 9/10.
Worth of money 10/10",5

Easy to use picture quality super,5
Every time it says out of paper. You can put a fan when the printer is on otherwise all papers inserted will fly away since it is designed in a vertical position. Many times only half of the paper is getting printed. Total waste of money,2
Cost per page print is very high.. Pair of color and bw cartridge is more than cost of new printer with cartridge,2

"Need too high cartridge cost for refilling,",1
If you are a heavy duty cycle of printing then you should avoid this printer because it's cartridge can print max of 120 pages only even if you refill cartridge. Ya one important thing that is if you refill it's cartridge it will get clogged in few refills only.,2
Don't buy this printer.. waste of money.. after 15-20 pages only you can able to print and cartridge of this printer is very expensive i.e. rs. 700+. In market you will get print per page 5₹ only.,1

"Black Catridge Stopped working after a month. Gray scale and color are working, but the black is not working. When checked with HP support, the product showed location as USA.",1
The cartridge is non-refillable. They don't mention this in the specs. the black ink cartridge lasted for around 50 pages. I wont recommend this. a new black ink cartridge will cost around 700Rs.,1

I am using it for more than 1.5 years. This printer is best suited for home purpose. Print quality is good. but always make sure to print 2-3 pages in the week. otherwise cartridge will be dry and you have to spend 700-900/-. You can also refill it with normal ink.,5
The printer came with two cartridges (one black and one color). The quality of these cartridges was extremely poor (might have been a fake also) and lasted exactly 8 pages of printing. So much for free cartridges and begin printing straight out of the box. Utterly disappointed.,1
"print blk n white upto 100 pages and color 50 pages in the 1st run ...the u cn change n refill cartridge...
Good for home purpose...go for it",5
"Pros
-Good quality printing
Reliable
-You can use it for Normal printing also
-Using from past 2 months good quality printing

Cons
-Ink cartridge is very costly n get very few pages..
-It's not recommended for photo printing and consumption of ink Is too fast.
-Consumes more ink",4
3rd class dabba item,1
"The Printer is easy to setup, I bought it as a gift for a kid who is 12 yrs old, he was happy,the only problem is the price of single original cartridge which is about Rs.750-900. But there are other duplicate ones which cost less so I have ordered that. The print comes fast and is good for home use, don't compare the paper to ink cost with the ones in stores outside. If you are a moderate user go for this and if you want to gift it to a school kid who is expected to add prints to his projects then this is the one because they don't need to print regularly.",3
Very bad performance..not able to print even a single page. Never buy it..,1
"Really bad. Only worked for a week. And after that, always doesn't recognize paper-'Printer out of paper'.",1
"quality not good, cartridge got empty within 5 days, and printer couldn't take the paper in for printing ....better don't buy this again",2
HP makes a marvelous printer in this range I mean 1112 is one of the cheapest and brilliant printer I mean I purchase this printer almost 1500 so that's good in this printer you have colour printing and black and white printing and 1 year warranty and you have one colour cartage and 1 black and white Cottage that's good I mean you calculate both cartage price it's above thousand so that's good you have printer in 1500 all over the build quality was very good very nice premium quality made by plastic and you have printing switch colour and black and white and very fast response and all over the printing speed is 7.5 page per minute black and white and colour I'm in 5 page permanent and very handy to store anyway and lovely and very caring product and you must be store anyway and very,5
"printing quality is good
create sound while printing and print slowly.
supported by window xp,7,8,8.1,10..i am using it with windows 10.
setup is easy..and installation hardly takes 10 to 15 min.
small in size as compare to shown in the pic..so easily portalble.
1 star is less from my side is juz bcz of the sound and slow speed..
although printer in this price range is good..for home purpose.",4
"Worst thing is printer costs 2000+ and cartridges costs 800+.
Better do not buy this.
Worst product, it works only for 50 prints.",1
"Good Enough.

Update after 2 years :
This printer is only suitable for light home use.Not close to office needs.Cartridges are extremely costly and thus refill kits are recommended.Driver issues may be present.

Overall,buy this ONLY if you need to print at home.
There are far better products with a little price hike.",3
Don't take this printer plz .. print is not coming,1
"Nice packaging, On-time Delivery, Best printer at this range.
Tested each and every part of this printer and there was no defect.
Performance wise it is best.
Ideal for home and office use.
Fast and Good Quality prints.
Easy installation
Sleek and Lightweight
Two cartridges capable of printing up to 150 pages
It can not be connected through internet but you can connect it to your phone using OTG
Cannot be connected through wifi
Cannot be connected to the Internet
Slow printing when connected to phone",5
"Great Product in this money range. I purchased it for 1600 rs. Worth of money. Printer is well packed in the box.
Pros
*Great printing quality
*package contains both colour and black catridge
*Low price
*Easy installation

Cons:
*White colour (its personal :-))
*Littlebit slow printing
*Low ink capacity
*Catridge can be refilled (Purchase refill ink from Flipkart, they offer tri colour and black for just 200 to 300 bucks)",5
Took only 2 to 3 printouts. Its good as of now. The connecting pin to the printer is loose. No proper instructions in d box bt can be managed usisng YouTube videos for the same. No idea about the ink and cartridge refilling. Can give print from Otg supported mobiles simply by instaling the hp plug in app. The product is exclusively for home use only and its worth the price! Same as shown in the picture.,4
"Please don't buy this printers, it's really waste if money, for Rs.700 cartridge u can hardly print 60 pages and after that the hectic process starts of refilling ink, and after refilling it will not work properly, better to print it from a shop which will cost much much cheaper than this,",1
Simple printer for home. Only thing is the cartridge provided is just for initial setup and will not last longer. You may have to buy new ones to get more prints.,5
"very good product, Compare your usage plus catridge costs before buying, For my home use, its excellent.",5
Awaiting payment. When refund will be initiated? We have returned the HP Deskjet Printer today 28-03-2018 at 10:45 am for refund process with all the accessories that were sent with the item. The output was pathetic and blurred printing in unreadable format. Never again recommend this HP printer to any one. Should have seen reviews before placing order. Thanks,1
"Very cheap price good printer, print quality is good , 100% secured packing by Amazon. I do not know how many pages will print by this black cartridge.otherwise very good and fast print.",5
"at this price this is a superb printer ordinary nothing exceptional , but at this price this is the best you can get. quality is good, colours are vibrant, and the size is very egronomical. the only downside is that it seems to use up too much ink. if you are looking for home use and you are on a budget, go for it",4
Used this product. Loved it. I printed some photos. Quality is excellent. Very affordable price.But ink cartridges are very costly.So it's better to reuse cartridges by refilling them.,5
Its a nice compact budget printer... Easy to install... print speed is ok... use draft option in print quality for reducing ink usage.... but the quality will be compromised a little bit... but its okei for taking print of notes... good for home usuage... i give full 5 stars for this printer...,5
"i bought it for office use,. paper size = postcard size to A4 size, work with single catridge either black or color or both. ink saver feature, fast print on draft mode, When printing pictures horizontal lines appearing, on high mode no problem, build in power adaptor. only support driver provided on the packet,. overall ok.",4
The printer is not detectable( BY the computer) evidently there is some problem. But i do not want to return it . i would rather like to get it set by the HP Peoplw! hope u will kindle some interest in those brave hearts of HP !,2
"The only drawback I observed is that it wont allow using its cartridge by refilling but we have to purchase genuine costly cartridge always as otherwise it will not allow printing stating that cartridge is not genuine linking online with HP site. It appears that the printer is popularized by low price to sell the cartridge like the Reynolds Ball point pen was introduced in olden days. Rs.3.50 to refill and Rs.5.00 for pen with refill. However, the printer with its genuine cartridge gives good prints on purchasing HP costly cartridge one by one which is not affordable to common people. Now my printer is kept idle as I am not so sound to purchase new cartridges of Rs.1000+ every time the ink finishes.",4
"Excellent Printer.
Value for Money Printer.
Excellent for Home Use like project of school printing, etc.
But Cartridge Price is High.",5
Performance is not quite good. Many times gives half page print. Feeling not good to purchase it. Bad experience with this.,1
cartridge gets dry in every 2-3 days............we are not a shopkeeper that we will use the printer daily. and cartridge are as costly as printer. very bad decision to buy this printer,2
Its a big mistake for me to buy this product. Each cartilage price is multiple times high than the printer price. So after first use(a very few pages) u can dumb this to waste bin. If anyone need this i will give u for 500.I just ordered recently and aftr printing its in my alamarah safely. I can't afford its cartilage cost.,1
The printer is good for normal work. Although the cartidges dry up very quickly. So it is good enough only if you print one or two pages on a daily basis.,3
Does not have a ink tank this product damaged serval times don’t buy this product,1
"Good quality printing, light weight, can print photos as well on a glossy paper sheet.
Only disadvantage- it doesn't have a scanner, so you can't scan documents or take photocopy of hard copies.",5
"First of all excellent dilevery and packaging by Amazon.
Now talking about the printer, it is very easy to use and to set it up.
Still I dont know how long the cartriges will last but the print quality is superb, and it prints very quick.
I dont know why too many customers are writing bad reviews for this product.
My last words, totally worth its value for money.
Go for it.
Thanks Amazon.",5
"good product. got it in a deal for prime members and can say that it worth the money i paid for it. If it was a bit more, it would have got 2 stars. print quality is satisfactory, printing speed for normal documents on a4 papers is good. color output is satisfactory. no hassle in setting up, just need to install drivers and its ready to print. Satisfactory product.",4
It's very good Printer I'm glad..to receive this product,4
Amazon is doing very bad promotion hp deskjet printers is very bad and they not replace and not reply now I suggest to go Flipkart Is doing best,1
"You can't get any printer at this price. If you are not printing more than 40-50 pages a month, this is just right for you.",5
Nice product. But it has some configuration issues in windows 8,5
Don't Buy this product... cartridge was not able to print more than 30 copies...,1
As usual the HP printer did fulfill my expectations. It is a great printer.,5
"printer is good, compact and professional delivery by amazon.

But after taking 15 pages of color print, catridge exhausted ? please respond",3
"When I gave the print some message seen that the the ink cartridge failure/damaged I remove them and
I replace with new a one ,l couldn't take any print .do not buy any product from Amazon because they cheated me the second time don't buy this product",1
"No words...
Printer is very light weight
But rotor is not working perfectly
i think other option are better",3
Good item but . Some thing is no right. This printer mantenace very high & costly. Cartiged price is up to 900 rs. Plz hp company I required cartiged but Price is very high than I not buy hp gaJets.,1
"Good product at this price.. Problem is that u have to change cartridges... Their price is same as the printer cost... Bt.. Overall it's a good printer at this price...
Cartridges you use don't lock to printer... When you refill cartridge it may show the cartridge is protected
Print quality is very good with HP genuine cartridges. But ink not lasts for even 50 copies",4
"Worth buying i purchased the product on 13 and i got it on 16 august

A good experience to buy this printer. Print quality is very good but it has a problem it can not print any word page. But over all good printer. My suggestion is that when you buy this printer also buy colour refile.,5
just received this printer few hours back. got software cd with it but saw there is no cd rome drive in my pc. then follow the manual which came alnong with it. download software online & installed quickly without any hassle. printed 6 pages. Quality is too good. Its branded printer. buy it without any second thought. u will not be disappointed for sure. let’s see how many pages it will print for me.,5

Excellent product.... hassle free installation.. and very good experience with this item...,5
"No point of buying this crap , Cartridges are too costly and they will run out after 60-70 pages only then you have to again spend 900 rupees for a new black cartridge. Basically you will pay 15 rupees per page, you can simply go to a cyber cafe and get your document printed it is much much cheaper at 1 or 2 rupees per page. Some people will say that you can refill it but HP is making it difficult to refill the cartridges.
Better go for an Epson CISS model.
I have bought an HP all in one before and this one but both of them are total waste of Money.",1

Good product.. recived before 4 days of delivery date.. fast delivered.. printing quality superb Specially on glossy paper photo print. But after almost 20-25 prints cartridges was down. Now having to refill tricolour cartridges. My sujjection for user who decided to brought this printer you have to order hp 1112 with cartridge refill kit too.,4
Very good product at a decent budget. Colors are quite natural. The quality of print is exceptionally good for this price.,5

Though the printing quality was good for the first few pages. But I have not even printed 20 pages and the cartridge seems to be over.,3
Excellent product worthy is its price,4
"Works like a charm. Ink runs out quickly, but refilling it works fine and is cost effective.",5
Most helpful when world can't go paperless,5
good printer,5
Printer is good but the cartridges are worst. Not more than 20-30 pages. And new one cost around 900 each. if you could spend more you could buy Epson printers with ink tanks for better result and last long.,3
"No, it did not meet my expectation as ink given with it did not function. I had to purchase a new one. It further raised a question in my mind regarding online shopping.",1
"Delivered product wasn't functional. Black cartridge was incompatible and tri color cartridge gave ""previously used"" error.",1
Great one for home use. Immediately got started with my MACBOOK and printed some very useful documents. It comes with a black and white cartridge and one colour cartridge.,4
As expected,4

"Very good for the price ! I don’t print so much but it’s enough for my needs. Mainly documents.

The photo print is a little bit disappointing but I didn’t choose that printer for that.

I’m really satisfied of that printer",4

Product at Price range.But it won't wrokout for any shop it's meant for kids projects.The cartridge should insert new we can't refill that😀 overall good,4
Very hard to refill. Refilling doesn't work properly. It prints 20 pages max. New cartridge cost Rs.800. Very very expensive. I wasted my money buying this damn product.,1

Will post a review on its working and other features after using the same.",5
"HP claiming that this printer can print 225 pages per cartridge But actually it can print 50 or 60 pages per cartridge. To buy new cartridges is much costlier than the printer itself. So it is only wastage of money to buy it.
PLEASE DONT BUY HP PRINTERS. GO FOR OTHER COMPANIES LIKE EPSON OR CANON which have better returns for investment. EPSON or CANON comes with ink tank system also.",1
Very good printer for its price!,5

HP DeskJet 2135 Colour All- in- one Printer,2
it is very bad printer,1
"Some slow , otherwise well",5
"Prompt delivery and the prints (one sided) are fine.

The biggest concern is the cartridge.
I bought the printer as i needed something cheap that would print 10-15 documents a day, 5 days a week. The cartridge shows low on ink from the 1st week and after another week or so just prints blank pages. The problem is that the cartridge is not actually empty. That is Just HP's way of making us buy expensive cartridges. The color cartridge is useless and you can't print anything even if one of the cartridge is full and the other is low on ink. It's a cheap trick and I am switching to Epson for now.",2
Awsm much useable 😎😘,5

Worst product ever made by any company.....It is not more than a plastic box and the customer care....... not to talk about them.......there is not a small trace of care.....they stuck u in the middle of call......Its a kind of mental harassment,1
"I'S VERY GOOD,VALUE OF MONEY AND IT PRINTS WITH A GOOD QUALITY",5
Too messy when the printer prompts alignment issue.The initial ink is too low for continuous quality printouts. Got less than 12 A4 size printouts. After that the red color started fading. Had to order for a new color cartridge the same day I received the printer.,3
Waste,1
"It is only 5 days since I purchased the Printer. So it is too early to say anything about its performance. However, I am happy with the printer, It is compact, fits the place where I wanted to install, printing quality, black as well as colour, is good. I feel it is suitable to one with a low budget and needs for occasional printing.",4
Very good,5
"Worst product, used for two weeks . Always shows its in ""error state"" . Pls dont go for this cheap garbage.",1
"working very fine,my 10yrs son is using it for his school assingments. ? cartridges costly.",5
Which printer is very cute and small and it has 2 cartridges which we get free with it but this one problem that it is very cheap although it's 1700 rupees and after that when you when you ask the cartridges in the market their very high in price as their 500-700 900 rupees and it's very costly the printing of this printer is really costly and I would like to tell you that the original HP cartridge for this model is about 900 rupees the black one and 1200 the combo one week and coloured cartridge is 500 rupees so I would prefer to buy the normal normal cartridges and after all there the same thing I would also like to recommend the normal heart I would also like to recommend the normal cartridges and you can try them because there cheap and their the same thing and about 300 rupees you can also by the way for kids which has 4 bottles of colour in and you can enjoy acted as in the cartridges you have gone with the printer so thank you thank you Amazon,5
"Very worst.. No more details provide by Amazon here, but as I used, I am telling that, new black cartridge rate 800-900/-, can print up to 100-150 A4 pages one side. Star submitting compulsory, so just gave, otherwise..",1
The printer doesn't scan .and we want to buy the printer and scanner in one machine .so can we returned the printer and but printer and scanner in one machine .if we doesn't returned the scanner. So please tell us the scanner which connect with printer is how much prize. And we want to tell that we use it one time. So please tell us that can we returned it .,1
"The product comes with the cartridge, which last long only for 20 minimal color pages. The technician asked us to print daily two colour pages in order to keep the cartridge free from drying. Quite insane system, this piece of info is hidden under condition applies*. Hence, not worth investing in such printers...",1

"It is a wonderful printer for home purpose and taking 15 to 20 A4 sheets of printouts per day. I had no issues with installation of this printer. It is so easy to install on windows platforms, just run the CD that comes along with this printer and then plug in printer in the USB, it will automatically do rest everything. Again, for home purpose and school children's project works, this printer is excellent choice and economical. For office purpose or taking more printouts, this is not the one!! you have to go for laser printers.",4

So far working ok.Its a low ink catridge printer.won't print more than 50 pages(depending on the type of colour of the pages you are printing) with a single catridge).But you can refill it with ink.AFFORDABLE AND EFFICIENT PRINTER.,4
Nice products because no Xerox,5
THIS IS NOT WORKING AND DAMAGE.,1
Not useful,1
This is a amazing product compared to its price,4
"I had placed an order for the HP Deskjet printer on 28 October 2020. This was a birthday gift for my daughter, to our disappointment, the printer didn't function out of the box. So we had scheduled a return pick up. The pick up executive arrived on 5th October, but to our surprise he mentioned that he cannot pickup the laptop as the printer serial number that has been given to him is different from what we actually have on the printer & they both don't match. Also to my dismay, I realized that the status is showing as ""Returning to seller"", In order to get a resolution I had called up Amazon customer service number and spoke to one of the customer service reps, who advised to send the picture of the Serial number on the printer so that the pickup can be reinitiated. The email ID that was given to me was image-requests@amazon.in, but any email sent to this address is not getting delivered and bouncing back. So now I am stuck with a non functioning & non returnable printer. Not at all something that I had expected from Amazon.",1
Very nice 👌👍,5
awesome,5
It was very very good product for very less amount and also useful for the poor people and also a nice product,4
"Using this machine for 1.5 years. Very good as far black n white is concerned. Can print lots of pages like 100 both side print pages without jamming. I haven't tried more than that.
Colour printing is good but paper gets wet with colour.
Refillable and work with cheap inks",5

Very good. very handy. good to have one at home. worth buying,5
Only printer,1
Great product.,5
"Greatly disappointed about the kind of tape wrapping around the sensitive parts of ink cartridges included with the printer as well as new spare cartridges that I ordered. The cartridges are taped up for protection, with some kind of glue that is almost impossible to peel off or removed by human nails but must be scraped off with a knife or screwdriver and that has caused damage to the sensitive parts of the cartridge making it unusable. Hence at present the printer works only with the black ink. I am amazed that no one has complained about this serious problem preventing full use of the printer. Is this a new issue? VERY DISAPPOINTED!",1
Good printer,3
Product is good but provided CD of installation is not working please replace it,3
"Compact and lightweight. It's good for light home use. I find no use buying a multi function printer, as a scanning app on your smartphone is good enough for ordinary use. (My earlier multi-function printer had many problems.) The operation of this printer is really smooth and I love the clean, sleek look of this printer. Didn't have any issues setting it up or feeding paper, unlike some other printers I've used.",5
Good product packing best performance..,4
Amazing print both colour and black and white,5
Its OK within its price.,4
The printer that I bought cannot be installed as the driver does not work,1
"WORST PRODUCT OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY , COSTLY CARTRIDGE DOES NOT WORKS GOOD ON REFELLING, ESTIMATED COST PER PAGE 7 TO 8 RUPEES WHICH IS UNAFFORDABLE BY AN INDIVIDUAL WHICH FORCES YOU TO QUIT AFTER 14 DAYS.ONLY HALF PAGES GET PRINTED ONLY BUY IF YOU WANT TO CURSE AMAZON OR HP 1112",1
Very good for home purposes,5
"Although Bought it from other website at a cheaper rate,i would like to share my experience.
Opening the intact packing revealed the box.On opening the box,There are few cables,2 catridges,few leaflets and the printer itself.Its light in weight easy to use as a single function printer.Looks are fine,nothing much to speak about.After setting up,it was easily detected by pc and without wasting an paper,it started printing properly.Print quality is better than expected from the price and the wonderful thing is that the setup catridge black one gave me 90+ prints ( standard question paper format texts on 70gsm paper),90% in draft quality but even in draft settings,print is damn good and sharp.Print speed is good in draft mode and goes slowerer as print quality is increased but the time taken is managable.I have tried loading more then 40 pages in the tray and it draws them perfectly.Tried printing from otg via plugin,worked flawlessly.Colour print is also good.Only con of this printer is catridge cost.I dont expect more than 25 colour pages from setup catridges,also i dont need colour printing.Black print gave 90+ pages on setup catridge.But i refulled it with 2ml black ink when it reached 90+ sheet mark.Lets see how refuelled catridge performs in the future,i will update this review soon.Please see the attached picture.
Update 17Aug,100pages now ,In total refill on 2.5ml although the catridge had not run empty still i refilled,after refill there were missing lines and texts on the paper,so i used the suction tool and voila the print was coming absolutely fine, since refill is dye based and original catridge ink is pigment so print quality will be different but the ink i used gave good black.Due to it being water dye based,the back of the page will bear information on its front side but one can do even with it.",4
Good product at great discount price...,4
A product bed,2
Amazing product at this price. Happy,5
I could not even start it. There was defect in the cartridge rail. HP uses flimsy parts. I could not even start the operative. Have asked for return and refund.,1
"I ordered the product for 1648 Rs. Amazon delivered it to my town (other online purchasing websites do not deliver in towns, Thanks to Amazon) through Gati Couriers. Received it well in time. Packaging- five stars.
About the product- HP are the masters. Installation- very easy. At this price, I don't think I could get anything better. It comes with trial cartridges(black and tricolour). I have used them to print 80 colour pages(single side A4), 50 black pages(A4 both sides). Believe me, the trial cartridges are the gifts (considering the costs of the cartridges you get, the printer is free). Print quality is also good. Not that good for photographs. Using it for 4years and working absolutely fine. About the cost of black printing, it is around 2.5-3.5Rs per page(one side). Cartridges are available online. Fulfils my need.
Happy with Amazon and HP. Thank You.",5
"I am not here to specify the features of the Printer, you can find them on the product page. This review is to make you aware of the facts you will be getting on spending your hard earned money.
~DONT EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM THIS PRINTER~(considering the price)
1. This can an ideal printer only if you are considering it for HOME use only. Nowadays every school give projects to student and a project without picture is considered a waste. Buying a picture related to the project is like searching a needle in the heaps of sand. Sometimes you get it and sometimes not. With the help of this printer, you can print anything you imagine if you have an active internet connection and you know how to use Internet.

2.Ideal for occassional bill printing if you are a small office or a business owner. Why I say occasionally because regular printing will be costlier considering the Ink and cartridge cost.

3.COST of Printing will be approximately around 75 to 95 paise for black and white printing and above 1 to 2.5 rupee for colour printing. The cost may vary on the quality of Ink Cartridge you are using. The cost I mentioned is applicable when you are using HP Original Cartridge and standard A4 paper.

4.QUALITY of printing will be Okay type. Please dont expect laser quality text or high quality pictures because you should also consider the price you are paying for the Printer.

IF YOU WANT COST CUTTING ON PRINTING simply follow these steps.
∆ Printer Properties~ Quality of Printing~select Standard Quality
∆Printer Properties~Ink Saving Mode (Or check the box which say 'Save Ink while Printing' )

BUILD QUALITY IS SIMPLY SUPERB AND SIZE IS VERY COMPACT.

FOR OPTIMUM PERFORMNACE
## Always use Original HP Cartridge. ##
## Avoid switching ON and OFF Frequently ##
(Everytime you turn ON the printer, it loads Ink to the tray by default)

Printers is really good for the price but future cost will depend on how you use it .

Hope it help you decide your purchase.",4
Not satisfy,1
I liked this product ..I wish to give 3 stars..but its not worth for it ...it makes my purpose .....but hp colour catridge dries very fast...and it prints very less amount of sheets....we have to fill up the catridges frequently....expecially the colour one....once i had the problem that paper stucked up inside the printer. ..it became tough for me to get back it to normal...wires are very loose...some how it can be manageable.....so one who ready to face these problems after purchasing it...can buy this product,2
Really good printer..,5
"After installing printer on Laptop on 1st day of receiving , it is observed that, after loading A4 pages on top loading area of printer and after giving print command, papers getting STUCKED in the Rollers not not moving further.

I want to hear on the above issue from AMAZON INDIA PVT. LTD., WORLD TRADE CENTRE, DR. RAJ KUMAR ROAD, BANGALORE And Sellers also. Manufacturing date January 2020",3
"at a price of about 1100, real value for money deal. does what i want it do do, prints are good enough for personal use, don't expect a production quality at this cost. don't be bothered about cartridge cost, you can always fill it using local ink, ant printing cost will be quite low then.
usb and power cable are long enough for placing it at convenient location near computer.",5
"anybody looking for a affordable printer then this is what you should purchase i.e HP DESKJET 1112.Its been 4 months and its working extremely fine. Considering the price point i.e 1600 a good choice The print quality is is really good. Works out of the box.
A small suggestion i like to give : lower down the print quality as this will print more paper with less ink usage.",5
Quick delivery..satisfactory product...overall an awesome deal,5
The printer consumes a lot of coloured ink. I had just printed 8 pages and it showed me a message that the ink is about to finish. In my last 2 prints the colour got changed. I had set green colour as background and it had changed to blue.,3
Good printer,4
High quality printing,5
"Not easy to use.Paper should be positioned with much care otherwise it will get stuck. Cartridge price is much higher when compared to the printer price.
Not a good buy.",2
The printer cartridge damaged it only work for 1 week or less,1
"I bought it for office use..Don't know about the cartridge performance yet..Very basic printer, only for those with limited budget",4
I want a ink for printer my phone number is 9010374093,1
"The lifecycle costs are too high - Each print out effectively costs 8 - 10 rupees.
Replacing the cartridges will set you back by 1800 rupees, and you cannot get more than 200 prints from them.

In retrospect, I would have bought an Epson printer - Each print out costing less than 1 rupee.",1
It's a worst Product. Never buy this printer.,1
Cartridges r costly,1
"I bought this product and started to use, only for 40 pages it printed clearly. And i unused printer for 1 month. After 1 month when i start to print a page. Words are not clearly printed(no brightness). So i managed anyhow after 1 month again when i start to print no brightness in letter full and full dullness, and i left for 2 months without printing. Now when i start to print any page no letter printing plain page is coming out. I bought ink and refilled in the cartridge also no printing only overflowing the ink in paper. Don't buy",1
"Good product,but tedious settings are required to start printing...",4
After 1 month of use we face the problem on printing,1
Its a basic printer from HP and it does the job very well. I am happy about it.,4

This is one of the worst product. Amzon doesnt take any responsiblity. after 15 days product stopped working. HP CUSTOMER Care person recommended to replace but amazon is not responding at all. Not good service. It was causually advised to return the product to seller. But seller has not accepted product. Not at all good service by amazon,1
"This is such an amazing printer for office and personal use. The print quality is just amazing and design is so sleek. I see many feedback reg the toner consumption which is a necessary evil. But you do get good quality ink cartridges which really works. There are many tutorials on you tube on how to refill cartridges which make your task easier. For Installation go to 123.hp.com, search for printer HP Deskjet 1112 and choose USB option to download the required software and follow the instructions and you are done.",5
Worse,1
Printer received without cartridges......☹️☹️,1
I think its cheap and best for casual home use or study material printing. The only condition is you should know how to refill the cartridges. Else its not worthy to buy.,4
Super expensive maintenance...803 combo catridges cost 2000...more than printer cost...go for costly printers like ink tank..... I am highly disappointed.,1
Nice product for the price and quality is fabulous,5
Good printing quality..,4
This printer is really good if you are using for home. I am using it for last 2years and I print educational data often. But the net price is toooooo high than local market. It costs INR1245 including GST here in Kolkata.,3
goo,5
"I regret .There is no software disc for installation. I got really trouble to get the software.

"Bought in Diwali sale for merely 1130 rs only, its good printer worth price, i got very good deal, which u might not get, but still its worth the price, go for it",5
The worst printer I have ever used. If you refill the cartridge then within 2 days it starts misbehaving and giving notification Cartridge Incompatible. You have to purchase a new one which cost 750 each time. It works like sweet poison for our pocket.,1
Print quality is very good in this Price... Easy to install.. And very easy to use .. Love this product,5
"Nice to use.. good color quality from HP
But ink cost is too higher.. it's 400 for single one

Moreover HP customer care services is the worst in INDIA. They try to evade your complaints and the TEAM is Highly incompetent to solve your problems after sales and keeps you away to approach them.

"Its worth every paisa u pay.
Works very smoth the print quality is very crisp nd it does what's it's ment to do very efficiently.
It's very compact in size strictly for Home nd Small office use only.
The 2 cartilage provided r setup cartilage so don't expect it to print 100 of pages.
Mine went dry well within first 45- 50 pages.
Got it reffilled at the stationary shop for 100 for both black nd colour.
Setup is bit tedious if u hv win10 system because it's not able to install drivers on itself so hd to download the drivers from third-party websites , once setup is done then it's very quick nd smooth to use. They should provide a driver cd along,would hv saved lot of trouble.
Pls buy the refill ink from Amazon so the running cost would be very cheap, u can do it yourself if u see he's it done once.",5
This Printer has a print capacity of 20 to 30 A4 pages in either Black or in Color. My Cartridge was finished in 2 days. New Black Cartridge cost Rs. 1000/- and Color Cartridge cost Rs. 1500/- which is the Rs. 2500/- and it is very high and more than the cost of the printer. So I have scraped this printer for Rs. 100/-. This printer is very very expensive and of no use. Totally Scrapped Printer.,1
"Purchased today @ Rs.1799, after connecting with printer on the hp site installed hp smart app & got a test print. About the cartridge cost every this is suspected. I know only cartridge refilling process may ease it otherwise the cost of cartridge is almost equal to the cost of printer.",5

Go for it if you need colored printer for home usage",5
product not good according to price need to update amazon not listing this types products bcz it's totally amazon fault...,1

"This is nice Printer which is very easy to install the process to be followed is given online in many videos. The process is very simple

1) Unbox the entire printer with all wires
2) Then find the 4 ink bottles & open the part to pour the same
3) pour the ink in the right ink cartridge of the printer
4) switch on the printer & then a long press of the red button post which it would take close to 7-10 minutes (ignore the different sounds)
5) your printer is now ready once the lights stop blinking
6) insert the cd & connect the printer to the computer
7) follow the process as in the CD.

Will take a good 20 mins if you plan to install all the drivers.

The print quality is good. The price seems a little high but only time would tell if the printer is worth the money.

Would have been a 5 star product except for the plastic used that looks a little flimsy. Plus have seen a lot of videos confirming that it can print only 30000 sheets.",4
"This Printer is awesome, and fully automatic, it can print HD quality photo without color distortion. Only one problem, regular printing is must, else printer head will jam with dry ink. Till 2 months, I have taken around 1100 pages color and b/w experience awesome pleasure. I will suggest to buy this rather previous models. Only black ink is reduced quickly.",5
"If you were using CHEAP Inkjet Printers with expensive Ink or EXPENSIVE Laserjet Printers with EXPENSIVE cartridge then it's about time you switched.
Bought on 19th June 2019, Delivered on 24th June 2019.
Used for 1 day, but took about 600 prints in a day. Both, coloured as well as black n white.
Opinion - Excellent print quality and very cheap also.
Basically, the print quality will not be upto the level of a laser jet but the cheap operational cost makes it worth buying. For whatever purpose you want to use it, the prints are awesome. Even the photos are printed in an excellent manner on any type of paper.
Before judging the quality please ensure that you choose the correct type of paper you are using in the printer settings. Example - If you choose glossy paper in the settings for a photo but are using a normal A4 paper then the print will not be that great. Whereas, if you choose A4 paper (Plain Paper/Bright White Paper) the same print will come in an excellent quality.
The printer has wifi direct option, if the printer is in range then kindly use the network of Printer itself, it is quite fast. If you are using it in an office then you can use it over a Wifi network (Setup can be done in a normal way using network SSID also and using WPS button on the router also).
The printer is fast when Standard quality is selected for printing whereas the printing is slow when High Quality is selected as it takes more details into consideration (For reading purposes, not much difference between both, Standard is the option you should choose).
For printing double sided, settings need to be selected from the printer properties. It is not automatic, so you yourself will have to take out the paper and input again in the manner shown in the dialogue box which appears automatically. It is hassle free and printing speed is good.
I would definitely recommend buying this printer to everyone. It is economical, convenient and user friendly.
PS - You might decide on the basis of other reviews also but then again I have tried and tested the printer. I bought Onsite extended warranty for 2 years also so I'm set for a period of 3 years without any hassles. I hope the review helps. If you have more money go for the one with digital display, but do check the quality of printing on that over youtube reviews before buying.",5
"This is currently the best inktank printer one can buy in this price range. Very satisfied. One would not miss the touch screen as once u connect the printer with ur phone with epson app, all the functions can be accessed and setting can be configured. Scan quality is very good and this is one of the best printers you could buy for photo printing. The quality is very good. There aren’t any problems but if I have to nitpick, I found that the print speed to be slow when u give colour print through phone. That might not be the case with everyone as I could have a problem with my network or it can be fixed in a software update. Other than that, this is the printer you can chose blindly for home and home office. Very satisfied and finally the per page cost is also very low compared to inkjet pronters. The right fit for my home and I believe for many homes too👍🏻",5
"I have used purchased this product as a replacement for my Epson L220. After one month of use (around 1700 pages) I am not satisfied with this product. below are my experience in detail.

SPEED: Speed is no way any improvement over its predecessors EPSON L220 or EPSON L380. It has average printing speed with a very frustrating issue of getting stuck between prints for 3/4 sec if you print more than 5 pages continuously. this problem really tests one's patience specially when you have a lots of color copies to do.

PRINT QUALITY: Print quality is average.My previous L220 prints little better images than this model. document print is below average too.. photo print is not recommended. can not pull more than 180 gsm. ONE MORE major problem is print head need to be cleaned every 2/3 days. line between texts is a common problem and text are not sharp as it should be.

PAGE YIELD: I wonder why Epson mark this printer as eco print. I have print only 1700 pages (mostly text only) and as you can see in the image above the black ink level indicator is already down below the third level, means one more step down the tank is empty. As per the EPSON web page , B&W page yield should be 4500 pages. I don't think it can print half of that count. its really very disappointing should be shame for EPSON.

My verdict on this product is that this product is not suitable for high use, doesn't worth the money and totally not recommended for commercial use. One star as it goes.",1
"Very very bad product . Stay away from buying.
1. Build Quality is very poor , very poor quality plastic used. feels like it may brake here and there.
2. Initial Setup is very much difficult. there is no display so its really very hard to input ip address and ip details.
3. Wifi direct is there. but no where the password is written.
4. Wifi network address needs to be configured each time the printer is powered on.
i am not able to take a colour print or scan a page as set up is yet to be done. will write the print quality after the setup and first use.",1
"Model : L 3152
Seller : Appario Retail
Price : ₹10350
Bought on : 30th Sep, 2019
Extremely good product, print quality is excellent. Setup is also easy.
This product is very similar to L3150 but it has a blue highlight.
Before setting this up please read comprehensive user guide which is available in L3150 product page in pdf format. Trust me setup is very easy.
Many people are saying that WiFi setup is complicated but it's not. Using instruction anyone can setup wifi connection. From then it will connect automatically but it takes 1-2 minutes to connect. Till now I have not used the cable to connect the printer with computer, WiFi is all the thing.
N.B. : I have used WiFi direct option only.

Recap:
1. Fill the ink
2. Charge the ink
3. Run nozzle test (1 page)
4. Take a printout of WiFi password and all that stuff (3 pages)
5. Setup WiFi
5. Download Epson iPrint from Play store
6. Start printing and scanning.

Hit like if helpful.🙏🏼",5
Don't buy. Not value for money. If you want multipurpose printer like Epson old L SERIES printer which can print on anything. This L3110 supports only on 70-80 GSM paper..,1
"photostat not working more then 4 pages same with the scan taking more then 3-4 minute for loading or i don't know why taking time so much, i am owner of my business facing everyday same issue. totally waste of money.",1
"I had HP 6830 before i got some printhead issue...

Don't waste your money
It is not a good printer

Speed is slow
Print quality is low
Wifi response time is slow

U can not give continuous command.. u need to wait for previous task to complete...

Black and white are ok
But colour is not poor...

Only good thing is ink tank
That's it!!

I will update you more later..
After my complaint..

I m a prime customer

I called in customer care
They said
If it is damaged only then, we can take it..
So suggest u to go for
Hp ink tank
Hp ink tank
Hp has much much better quality..",1
"Its working fine, speed is too good. Earlier I was using Leaser Printer. Leaser printer ke takkar ka hai speed main. I can also take print/ Scan while there is power cut. Best Printer for Small and Medium office, don't know why others putting adverse remarks perhaps they are using it as photo printer, actually its not a photo printer and not suitable for the people engaged in photography profession. but for others it is ultimate.",4
This thing does not work. I tried to reach Epson customer service but couldn't connect. Amazon customer service is also not helpful. Both Epson and Amazon are giving bad experience.,1
"Don't ever go call your printer service man they will just waste your 50 percent of ink and there is no solution for good print

Daily you have to do head cleaning
No worth of buying this",1
"L3150 is not a good printer , printing is very slow , scanning is also very slow copy is very very slow",1
"This is is not a user friendly product, trust me.
I had an epson L150 -the ink tank non wifi one.
The build quality of that product and print was excellent .
This on the other hand was rubbish,If I print over wifi direct even if quality is set in high ,It still is a 5/10 print.
The ink tank seems to finish ink fast.
The epson app is the worst,so undeveloped and troublesome to use.
I can't find a way to connect the printer to the wifi ,I can't find a way to use remote printing or to even register my product on the epson site as INDIA is not listed in the countries allowed to register.
It's low quality printer.
And who uses a wps router? I don't see why I can't directly connect my printer to the wifi without that.

The bottom line is ,unless you want to break your head using this product.
Dont buy it,my cousins got an hp wifi printer and I used theirs ,setup was easy and overall side by side.
I really realised how bad epson is at their tech.
The last printer I had was good but this one is disgusting and low quality build.

I REALLY REGRET BUYING THIS PRINTER AND I DON'T LIKE ITS BUILD QUALITY OR PRINT QUALITY.",1
Good,5
"I think I had taken a very good decision buying this from amazon because The first printer I received was a bit defective and did not work properly but amazon helped me through that tough time they replaced it with a new one without any call or message they didn't even ask a question for replacing. I never thought amazon would give such service In these though times now the pros and the cons of the printer

Pros

1.Epson customer service is very good
2. Print speed is very fast and much better than canon and hp but the print quality is not that good if you compare with canon printers
3.Now the best thing about the printer is hp and
Canon use print head where the ink dries but this printer stores the ink where it has to print and then prints it that's the main reason why I bought it above hp and canon

Cons:-
1.Very big compared to hp and canon printers
2.Is a bit expensive than hp and canon
3.Paper gets stuck if you a slight old paper and if you use a paper that is folded the ink gets printed in the paper you( can notice it in the first photo)

And I see many people ask can you print with you mobile with the usb version

Ans:Yes you can print with noko print application though you can see some adds in the app

I have written by using 30 minutes of my time hope you find it helpful

And if you are confused where to buy from amazon or Flipkart I would recommend you to purchase it from amazon",4
Pls don't waste your money,1
Print quality is really good. Budget and cost effective printing.,5
"Pros: 1.Very small size, Less weight,only 4.5 kgs. Brother Hp weighs 10 kgs in this category.
2. Very cheap to refill. OEM epson inks are cheaper than competitors. Also duplicate inks are half the price and available easily. You cant get good duplicate inks for hp and brother models.
3. Very fast Printing speed. 33 pages p/m in BW mode is amazing.
4. Easy to refill ink tanks. Easier than filling a watterbottle😜
5.multiple printing options ie. You can print even visting card using this printer.

Cons: 1. Could have added PVC id printing options. Higher GSM card getting jammed.
2. Sometimes full color printouts on 80GSM papers gets stuck and torn because of some exposed plastics under the printing head

Will post a long term review after few months",5
"It's amazing. This Ink Tank printer is so much better than my HP Deskjet 3630. Here's why -
1. Printing speed is substantially faster
2. Quality is superior.
3. Build quality is great.
4. The EPSON software is highly customizable
5. The Noise is minimal, you won't even notice that your printer is doing its job unless you're in an extraordinary quiet environment.
6. And most importantly, the COST OF PRINTING is way too low. The inkjets will burn your pocket if you print 100s of pages for your study or research or whatever. And believe me the injection process to reuse cartridges are just plain harassment. What you get with Ink Tank printers is cheap Ink bottles that are just too easy to refill and cost of printing will be like 1/500th compared to the inkjets, at least theoretically.

So, don't think twice about the cost of the printer compared to the Deskjets, this one will save you a lot of money in the long run.",5
This printer is very problematic. The conventional Epson Blinking lights error is still existing on this model. Just after printing 10 gloss paper printing the printer doesn’t work. Now forever the lights on the printers blink and I cannot do anything about it as there are no solutions for this sort of error other than taking it to service. I requested for refund instead they providing me replacement. I just hope the other piece works just fine.,1
"Pathetic support...
Since last one week trying various options to install printer software and driver...but not getting through...eventhough service person temporarily managed but again failed to do setup...both online. And with CDs also... asked customer service agent also...got feedback that same problems with this series ....going to return the printer....
Disappointed with EPSON....",1
Very bad product.. Printer printhead jam just within 3 months/500 pages. Very bad after sales service. Customer care executive are not supportive. And service technician doesnt come at scheduled time. Overall a very disappointing product.,1
"The printer was in good condition the delivery was quick and superb. I called up Epson technical team to send someone for installation. They responded quickly and the guy came in 2 hours.
The bad part was that it took him around 1.5 hours to get this printer up and running since there were some initial firmware issues. Once it was resolved the printing was happening correctly but the scanner/copier failed to work at all. The technician tried several times but it did not work. I had to, unfortunately, return the item.",1
Scanner glass damaged ... on arrival..........,2
"WiFi connectivity from laptop to printer is really a difficult task but one thing you have to remember that if printer is connected to laptop through WiFi there are two options named as Epson l4150 and Epson 553D32 will be shown under printers and Faxes heading and whenever you want to print you have to opt EPSON L4150 Series for data cable connected process and EPSON553D32(L4150Series)for WiFi connected process under the heading ""How do you want to print your picture""",4
"The printer is best for first 14 days (its my personal experience) afterwards its start showing problem of ‘both light blink’ i.e. paper jam, no printing no copy. After searching the solution in YouTube (due to pandemic situation onsite visit are hold by company) it came to know that, this is a universal problem in ‘EPSON’ printer and surprise that still the company not able to solve this.
Once log the call, the call center revert quickly while discussion with the technician he confirm that it’s a hardware issue need to solve in service center only. My frank opinion before anyone wants to purchase this please visit YouTube and search ‘Problem in EPSON’.",1
"paper jam problem,head errors,malfunctioning",1
"1st day experience. Info page showing fail status and wifi password cannot be retrieved. Lines appearing in prints and not solve even after head cleaning twice and waste lots of costly original ink. Printing stops in middle and paper has to pulled manually. Though to replace the printer and Amazon told to contact epson. Epson once disconnected my call saying techical problem. After called them they gave complain number. This printer was not in my budget still somehow managed it and this happening. Very important exam after 3 days. Now should i study or stress my head this box which epson calls printer. Aaa thuu. Will amazon or epson compensate for the lost ink or my precious time or my cool of mind to study.

Update after 16 days usage.
Printer is good. Print quality is good. Fast. No auto duplex is sad. Ink is costly.
Advice: no screen so, installation was difficult. Better call technician for installtion. Will update later if any problem found",4
"If we use normal paper to print black-n-white, quality is not same like my HP laser printer, but if we use glossy photo paper to print image, quality is just AWESOME! However, I am having problem to understand how it works in wireless mode, it's not very smooth to make it work from Mac or iPad or Android. I would give 10/10 for quality and cost, however ""Easy to use"": 6.5/10. May be we could not figure it out properly :(",5
Very easy to use and convenience of wifi. Easy setup. Good accurate color reproduction on photos. However on normal kodak photo paper (200gsm) it makes roller marks (multiple vertical lines due to pressure and not ink). I don't know why we can't improve this technology to use something like pinch rollers in cassette decks which dont scratch. Very silly to have this kind of issue in printers made in 2018.,4
"Amazon doesn’t allow me to return the product. I won’t be able to return the product after 24h September. They just hold the return date to be passed. The product is not convenient because when a paper is jammed, I have to open the front cover with a screwdriver. I am not willing to do that every time. Please support me for returning the product.
Thanks!",1
"CONNECTING TO WIFI EVERY TIME IS A HEADACHE , IT DOESN'T CONNECT AS QUICKLY AS A CELLPHONE, YOU HAVE TO ERASE THE OLD SETTINGS , SWITCH IT ON AND OFF SEVERAL TIMES TO GET IT CONNECTED. PRINT SPEED IS TOO SLOW. PRINT QUALITY IS OKAY. IF YOU GOING TO USE IS MAINLY AS A WIFI PRINTER , STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINTER. I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER 3 MONTHS USE AND I AM FED UP WITH THE CONNECTIVITY PROBLEM.",1
"Iam writing this after using this printer for a month. Before its purchase i was confused with other printers like most of us are in between hp 410, 415, brother t 510w.
To be honest this epson l 3150 is best printer with minimum ink price. Best in class picture prints provided u use fujifilm glossy photopaper of 180 gsm.
Very sharp and clear images with original color combination.
Photocopy works well u are printing less than 25 prints at a time it works smooth under 60 seconds it will photocopy.

All I can say it's the best wifi printer with very easy installation, one can install on his/her own. Wifi direct function is so easy to use.

Finally dont read too much reviews about this just go ahead. Iam using this in my hospital with daily 1 color print and 10 photocopies.
Iam fully satisfied.",5
We purchased this printer and are happy with the value for money that it is providing us. THANK YOU Epson and Amazon...,5
This is a direct wifi printer and it's really worth having it. Wifi increased the usability by many fold. Epson creative print application is not supported by this model and to me it's a negative point for the printer. Scanning speed gets reduced after few continuous scan however for few scan it is ok. Photo quality is better then L380 and is acceptable. Roller mark as vertical lines are observed on photo that is negative for photo printing. Epson demo person are not equipped to give demo with demo photo print.,4
"Bought it almost 4 months ago and I must say, this is a very good printer. Effortless to use and One thing I must mention is that, it printed way more than my expectation.
The print quality is superb, both in black and white, color copy.
The printer is made and designed in such a way that, it uses ink in a very optimal way letting the users print more pages.
Easy to use and install the drives. The technical support is also very good I must say.
Call the customer support, and they come in no time to get your problem solved.
I would like to mention that, always use original EPSON ink as it will increase the life span of the printer and also the print quality will be very good.
Use papers with thickness 70 GSM or more to get the best results.
Excellent for home, office use. I almost print 1200-1500 prints a month and have no complains with the printer. SO anyone looking for a color printer cum scanner should buy this.
I bet, you wont regret buying this printer.",5
"WFH becoming the norm and not option , I decided to buy a printer to replace my existing defunct printer .
Opted for Inktank type over Inkjet type (High Cartridge Cost) and laser (Colour option costly) .
Preferred 3 in 1 for easy photocopies at home with Wifi option for print thru mobile .
Selected Epson over HP and Canon on the basis of better printing reports received from online feedback .
Ordered Model L3150 which was Amazons choice and best option available at time of order (in price range) .

Pros :
1) Print Quality is good
2) Ink Bottles are good and easy to replace
3) Light and Compact design
4) Wireless printing is helpful with mobiles , laptops and tabs becoming common
5) Easy to set up

Cons
1) Delicate Body . Needs to be handled carerfully . Loading paper Tray gets easily dislocated and difficult to refit.
2) Ink wastage in installation . However can be minimized with proper technique
3) Customer support is only for receiving calls and they do not have basic idea of the product or installation .
4) Configuring Wifi connection and set up requires some effort .
5) Remote Printing is possible but cannot scan remotely .",4
"I like the product though it's not that easy to install for people who are not well versed technically. It can be challenging for them. The wifi is not working so with my very busy schedule I contacted Epson via FB a person always called me at wrong time. I gave a schedule to call me again, but still the person who used to call me called at wrong time. It was very disappointing as the Epson asked me to call the 1800 number to register the complain. I have the call recording to prove this.
You will like the printer but the Epson support is very poor. People will regret purchasing the product if at all it goes bad.",2
"Really impressed with product it has many pros and minor cons, I'll explain it to you
PROS
1) Nice print quality
2) Nice design by Epson
CONS
1)2) Speed of the printer is really low it get upto 2 pages in 18 seconds(BnW) and 2 pages in 1min (colour)
2) Connectivity issues such as wifi or app
3)it's really running smoothly till only 200 pages of print but after that Speed is really begin to slow and reduce ink level at a really high speed
4) After completing 200 pages of printing, the speed of the printer also slow down, and get only 1 color page in 45 second
5) But after all I'd really thankful to amazon, as they return my money back even at the usage of 7 day ( 200 ) pages.
So after all I'd like to prefer NO to this printer",3
"This product has had a lot of defects with the print quality and the print heads. In the 6 months since I have bought it, I have had to call Epson Service 5-6 times. They changed the inner motherboard once and have cleaned the print heads, nozzles and the connections multiple times Everytime they come. 3/4ths of the black ink has gone into this without any left over for printing. When I asked for in warranty replacement, Epson refused. It has been less than a month since the last Service and again the black cartridge is not printing. Lost time, effort and almost 11K Rupees because of this product. Never works when a printout is required.

Defective product but worst service and warranty maintenance by Epson. Never buying from Epson again.",1
Photo paper is not pulled and hence photo is not printed. It is useless for printing photos. Glossy paper with more than 130 gsm is not accepted. Hence standard 180 gsm photo paper can't be fed. Also the print quality is not true photo quality. Don't buy,1
"Wi-fi based printer and scanner, Good Quality prints with best speed. Light weight and required small place. We can print mobile photo directly using wi-fi",5
"1) Install service not available for about a month (May be because of lock down, phone response also not there).
2) Vertical paper feeding is no good. Every time you want to use it you have to open the paper slot, take out support and remove left over papers after you are done and put in the support back and close the flap, you cant leave papers there ready for next use when you need to, quite inconvenient.
3) One needs horizontal paper tray so that you can keep a paper stack there.
4) Output is very slow with WiFi, it is better to use direct cable connection between Laptop and Printer.
5) Giving print command from mobile phone with an ""Epson I Print"" App not good. With the phone and printer on the same internet/ WiFi, one should be able to give print command directly, without an App, with quick response from the printer.
6) Scanner is good.
7) Print quality is good.

As I am using the printer for just about a month, I don't know if it will give 7500 prints on one ink bottle set.",4
"Superb printer, exactly what I was looking for.

Few points about this printer

1. Print quality is great
2. Print speed is good
3. High page yield 4k mono/7.2k color
4. Setup is easy accept setting the wifi part
5. Instruction manual given could have been a bit more detailed. No clear steps given on how to set up the connection to home wifi router need to break the head a little bit
6. Ink filling is so easy and spill proof design
7. Low cost printing per page, 7p for black, 18p for color
8. Ink bottle T003 is also reasonably cheap around 400/450 per bottle
9. Value for money. One time investment in right direction for longer run
10. Scanner and photocopier is so great work like charm
11. Already scanned a copy book for my kid. Print quality is in great color even on normal paper, yet to try on photo paper
12. A must have for home use or small office purpose
13. Light weight and compact design
14. Don't think more go for it",5
"things which I overlooked while buying this
1. its wifi printer , its NOT air printer
2. It has no screen, so you break your head for error
3. it gives you an option of hundreds of apps for epson....you get charmed by their features download couple of them and then one by one it shows that they dont work for the printer model you have
4. install driver to print, upload to cloud to print.....

;pros

1. very fast
2. very economical",5
"I got this to print few pages since we are all working from home now. Set up was super easy, just download the software from Epson website (they give a CD but who has a CD drive anymore?). Really have nothing to complain about.
Pros -
1. Connecting to WIFI was easy and the printer has stayed connected for over a week. No drop in signal.
2. Wake up from sleep mode and to print was really quick, was able to print the first page in less than 5 sec from the time it woke up and started printing.
3. Scanner is working good, no issue there.
4. Refil was easy, the ink comes in a no-spill type bottle and there is no way you can mess the refill.
5. Unlike HP and other printers which use a cartridge, this one uses ink tank. Hence you dont have to fill it up fully if you print very little and not worry about ink drying up.
6. App is good. You can basically do anything from the app that you can do via computer.

Cons -
These are not really issue as they are what defines a low end ink tank printer, but something that can be a deal breaker for few.
1. No ADF, it can hold some 10 paper at a time. We need to keep adding paper
2. Scans via the glass, so cant scan many pages at one go.
3. Original Epson inks are not always available on Amazon. HP seems to have their products much more often and always in qtd.",5
"I was looking for printer for printers 10 prints a day ...so i discussed with friends. All my friends said buy anyone Epson or HP all good but buy INTANK. Hence i read everything. For my case EPSON, BROTHER were coming to best. Hence my friend was using EPSON from 4 years ..so i blindly bought it.
1. Printer speed is good
2. Resolution for print is good
3. Cost effective
4. Works wireless via phone, win, mac laptops.
5. Easy to use & install

I think you can blindly buy it. Warranty is 30K pages or 1 year whatever comes first.
Any queries let me know.
All intank printers are good but depends on use case.
If you use case is Printing pics etc more ..go for Canon or HP. Else
If color printing is not only thing ...rest all parameters EPSON/ brother are good.
Go through youtube video people explains is it well",4
"Perfect and a very good quality printer. The speed for black and white pages is good, although color print out speed is not so good. However, a high color print speed should not be expected from a compact ink tank printer for home use. Installation is easy and clearly mentioned on the instruction guide. Wifi connectivity can be easily established as per the instruction guide. Epson iPrint app needs to be downloaded on your mobile for direct mobile-to-printer print command. For desktop/laptop, either download the same app or install the application from the CD given. Scanning and photocopying works well. Epson genuine ink cost is ver less compared to HP. Overall, a value for money product as compared to similar other printers esp. HP or Brother.",5
"I previously had a hp 3545 and some of the points I'm drawing a comparison against it. I will not go into too much of the pros as many have already mentioned. I'll give my views on what irritated me the most.

1. Build quality is very delicate. My older printer which cost 1/3rd off this price was very solid. This printer feels like if I hold it with firm grip I may end up damaging it.

2. Installation was okay but my 1st print itself the paper got jammed. I had to call customer care. I saw that they have to remove screws and open the full top panel to remove pieces of paper stuck to the rollers. Again, was super easy in hp. No need of screws and being extra careful and all.

3. Black ink depletion ' the technician told me that the pipe for black is longer than others and hence shows the depletion faster when it is new. I verified somewhere in the manual saying when the ink is installed the first time, the expected yield is not obtained.

4. Super slow scanner compared to my older printer.

5. The print head needs regular cleaning or else even in high quality print more you'll see bad printing. This cleaning will take some extra ink I guess.

6. I thought the ink would be easily available but I see in Amazon itself the t003 black ink is usually not listed or out of stock. Not sure if this corona is the reason or something else.",4
"Best all in one printer, however the printing of photoes does appear to be a little bit of low in their quality comparitively to canon and the Gsm support could be higher,

Scanning part could be made a little bit fast, even for lowest quality scanning, it's takes around 1 min

Otherwise for Xerox, and printing B/w this is THE best in the competition
The print speed is takes around 25 second for one sheet on highest quality for B/W

Thus a good alrounder for home use, while i would not recommend for colour printing and mainly on higher gsm",4
"i did a through research before buying a printer, i had HP previously which was severely outdated (print cost of Rs 5- 10) with cartridge. Also HP support is abysmal.
i had canon and Epson in mind both being intl brand with fairly good support.

Pros.

- WiFi for both mobile (less useful) and laptop. can connect directly or through router.
- tank ink system for better economy of effort.
- you can have wireless experience (only one cable of power)
- cloud printing
- decent scanner.

Cons.

- box design
- it is nozzle of head, have to be fairly regular in operation (once blocked its best to replace)
- can't think of any other cons.

it is what you pay for, it is cheap in long run, i print usually my office documents and mostly for my daughter's projects, test papers (online classes) and what not.

a good buy and i recommend it.

the seller is top class and no hassle with delivery.

all in all a great experience.",5
"It is delivered today. I went through the installation set up looking you tube video as customer support person is not allowed to visit my house due to restriction imposed for outsiders to enter our society premises.

The installation process is very smooth and it takes around 10 minutes for ink charging. I installed required printer utility on my Linux and took some print and scan. The picture quality is very good and also same picture quality of photocopies.

As per some you tube videos, this printer has very short life span. Usually printer head problem occurs after 1-2 years.",4
"Very difficult product to install by yourselves
We have lodged call for installation

Will update the feedback once we have got our prints",1
"People who are looking to have a printer, but not used regularly should avoid this printer . Reason being black ink gets clogged if not used daily and to unclog it we have to do nozzle clean or head clean which takes most of the black ink and is a cost to us.. Also go for laser printer if you want to have prints not regularly.. I have wasted my money taking this and at any point of time to take print I have spend half an hour to 1 hour firstly to clean the nozzle and head and sometimes it also won't work..",1
"First 5 prints on day one was good. But i made my second attempt 10 days later, and issues creeped up. Black ink was not being used for print. Print quality was degraded. When called the customer service, they told me that their server is down and could not take up my complaint. After my purchase..now patiently waiting to bring my new printer back on line . Its not a good experience",1
It's a good printer for domestic purpose. Would recommend a duplex printer if one is not willing to do the odd even printing.,5
"Update: I have used this printer for over a month now. Updating the reviews based on photo print quality which I tried today.

Pros:
- ink is cost effective
- WiFi

Cons
- picture print quality is so bad that I want to return the printer (unfortunately it is too late). The pictures are much darker and extremely dull. Printer leaves lines on photo paper, some thing that I have not observed with any other printer. My $50 HP printer, from 2013, prints far better pictures.
- slow and stops for buffering when printing using WiFi (I started printing a 17 page pdf (just text) and I finished a 6 inch sandwich before 17 pages were printed. And I did eat in a very civilized manner.
- AirPrint is not supported so you are forced to use the Epson iPrint app.
- I haven’t yet figured out a way to scan multiple documents in single pdf format. I see only 3 options jpeg, tiff and 1 more, no pdf.
- no lcd screen means I have to use Epson iPrint application.
- I haven’t yet figured out how to print double sided documents. I see the options for page size, quality, orientation etc but on the same page of the application I couldn’t see the print double sided document.

I will update the review if I notice any difference.",1
"Not even a year of purchase. Already has caused issues twice.
Issue:- While printing,paper went back and got jammed. Worst part is yet to come...
1) When raised an issue with customer care, the service person thinks that I'm mad and I have done something. He was not ready to accept that it is product defect. Finally convinced him and he had open the printer to remove the jammed paper.
2) Issue has arrived again now and paper has got jammed. Eager to see service executive response this time.

Moral:- I would suggest not to buy this.

Disclaimer:- I'm not a newbie to printer, I had been using cartridge printer before buying this one. I had no issues with that even after 3 years of using and still have no issues with that cartridge printer.",1
"After using HP printers for most of the time, am trying epson brand, as its a reputed name in printers. Also ink tank technology is a great thing as it reduces per print cost. Installation takes time, have to be patient and let the printer complete it. Also the software will auto update to latest version. Tech support could be better as registering the printer for warranty was bit difficult.",4
"The printer is east to setup, just need to follow the instructions. Yet to test a photo quality page.

Have got a problem of red and green light blinking together which is blocking from printing anything. Seriously didn't expect this tho happen within 30 days period. I have raised a ticket with Epson support, the service executive mentioned that 2 parts are having problem and need to be replaced. Awaiting for part for the past 2 days",3
"Like
1) The printer is light and fits well anywhere.
2) The print quality is reasonably good
3) The refilling of the cartridges is pretty straight forward.
4) The WIFI operability is little cumbersome.

Dislikes:
1) The print rate is painfully slow
2) Making the color print work is really painful. I am talking about the initial setup. For some reasons, colors from the color catridge storage container did not flow automatically into the print head. I had to literally use an injection(suction) to get the colors flowing into the cartridges mounted on the print head.
Note: This issue is only with the color cartridges but not with the black one. A non-technical user may not like this experience.
3) The manual does not clearly explain that Epson software needs to be installed on your mobile phone to be able to print the docs or pics from your cell phone. Had to do lot of research on internet to get it working.

Final verdict: Once the initial hiccups were sorted out, its been working well without any issues so far. I would rate it 3.5/5",4
"Third class printer. Stopped printing after 10 days. Confusing setup, No Dispay, Worst printing i ever saw in my life. Third grade plastic quality. Total money wasted.

"Value for money for an ink tank printer and can used for home and small office needs.

The print quality is good and yield is decent too.
However I found the print speed below my expectations. Of course I didn't expect it to give the print per minute speeds as claimed by the manufacturer, but printing large number of pages over wifi is a pain as it takes a lot of time.
One needs patience for printing high number of pages over wifi or wifi-direct.

Installation is neither difficult nor easy but one can do it by himself/herself too after following the directions provided.
But the installation process can be made slightly more user-friendly.",4
"I am an industrial designer and needs to print a lot of color prints.
PROS
1) Astonishingly fast print with wifi like 2 pgs per second
2) Easy and fast wifi connection
3) Clean and 9/10 b/w print quality
4) Easy to fill ink tank reffils
5) Amazing tech support within 1 day in my case.
6) Scan quality is good.
7) Smaller than other ink tank printers.
8) Very low noise level
9) Easy to install paper.

CONS
1) Decent quality color print. 7/10
2) Ink depletes 40% faster than claimed.
3) After 2weeks the print had lines. i tried to do cleaning as mentioned in manual, no improvement happend. The tech support came in a day. He let the ink tank cap open for 1/2 an hour to let the air in. And print was good again. He suggested me to do so every 15days.
4) The ink bottle lasts only 1& 1/4 time. It means you can only fill 1 time at installation and other 1/4 time when ink is finished.
5) Confusing and non intuitive control panel.",4
Nice printer it is very easy to instal the drivers and the papper adjecting is some difficult,5
"This is really a good printer. I am using this printer since 2 weeks and its really doing its job. Great printer for home use and really cost effective. Printing cost is really low. If you are looking for a good printer for home use or small office its the best printer. I am using with Macbook Air 2020 Intel model and it works great.

Pros.
1. Printing quality (Colours are really good)- 5/5
2. Printing cost is very low( 10 paisa for B&W and 18 paisa for color print) - 5/5
3. Printing speed is really good, takes some time in color print - 4.5/5
4. Connectivity - 5/5
5. Compatibility ( I am using with mac, working well ) - 5/5

Cons.
1. I have to struggle a bit to first time setup with mac, I think setup with windows will be easy.
2. If you have dual band router then you have to connect with 2.4Ghz only. but this will not create any problem.

Best printer for home & small office use. For homo use you can print very good photographs as well. Works with matte paper, glossy paper. Really good printer for kids projects or colour printing.",5
"This is the first inkjet printer that I have purchased so I don't have much experience about maintaining one but,

Firstly, the printer I was delivered was made in the Philippines and when I try registering the serial number for warranty it says that the product/serial number does not exist. The customer care was of minimal help asking me to send an email attaching the details from which I still haven't gotten a response. Mind you if the serial number is not registered, your product cannot be under warranty or receive any service or maintenance from Epson

Secondly, the design and the sturdiness of the printer feels very underwhelming, making me question my decision of paying the price of 15k.
The installation was not the simplest, I tried connecting the printer to WPS and to my phone but neither of them worked so ended up connecting it to my windows PC in which the Epson software feels Jurassic.. like it was made in the 1990s or something

And lastly the scanning and printing experience is average. I'm not very aware of how much other printers use up the inks but this one seems average as well. The scanning on 1200 dpi takes a year to finish and the printer head needs constant cleaning which uses up quite a lot of ink.

So I don't know, I feel like either I got a faulty printer or the reviews seem to be made by individuals who like adjusting to the problems that the printer seems to make

Over all, not a seamless experience. Do not recommend. Go for Canon or something.",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 This product is completly waste of money
Last time i raise a queiry for this problem
They visit my sight and was solved this problem 6 month 2 month gao respectively ,but this problem is recurring
Even i perint last time maximum 50 pages only in last 2 month after they solve it.
Now i have no warraty period and this issue raise again
I have to pay for their bad product quality regular basic

I think it is not cost efficient for personal use",1
"Bought printer during lockdown to print school related things. Did a lot of research to decide between ink tank and ink jet. That plus advise and feedback culminated in the purchase of the 3152. And it’s awesome!

The set up was very easy. Of course I didn’t read the instructions carefully so it took me a bit more time but that’s my fault. Set up was fast otherwise. I have set up the WiFi printing - in fact we only use that. Everyone in the house including the wife and kids have learnt how to print without an issue. Initially it looked like the blank ink was finishing really fast but doesn’t look like it.
Keep in mind initial head allignment will use up ink bit thereafter it’s great.

Not as great as a laser obviously. And I think ink jet quality is better. But for school etc this works very well. Ink jet would not last these many prints for sure.

Have been using for around 40 odd days. The usage has been heavy due to school so not sure how it survives low usage.

Did have a minor challenge in registering warranty but a quick email to Epson sorted it in no time.",5
"Recently purchased Epson l4150 after almost 2 months of research on finding best suited printer for personal use. Read almost all d reviews on amazon of previous buyers after shortlisting L4150 as final choice. The reviews mentioned issues like installation problem and poor print quality however haven't faced any yet...wireless installation has some glitches but gets easily resolved by following step by step process of installation guide ( requires an external internet modem router for wireless connection ). Print quality is good both monochrome and coloured.
Very compact , user friendly, excellent packing...quick delivery
Printing is bit noisy and average speed but no complaints in print quality
If looking for a all in one ink tank printer it is one of d best in its price range although
Slightly expensive but worth all the money
Review written after 3 days of usage...",5
"The installation process is not at all simple. Me being the technical guy had so much difficulty setup this printer. I then had to connect this printer with USB cable to my PC. Unable to setup the wifi part of this printer. Cant setup in the mobile with wifi direct. Scanned one image and then printed it, the print out came very faded. I m still not sure what went wrong in the installation due to which the color print out came so pathetic.",3
"I bought this printer during the Republic Day Sale. I needed one for home printing which was cheap to operate and use. It was received in very good packing. After seeing a couple of YouTube videos and the attached instructions I was able to install it myself. It was a breeze doing it. Using the CD was able to install and configure the printer over the WiFi connection. I also installed the Epson imprint app on my Samsung M31 and it detected the printer immediately. Now, I am able to print from both devices easily. I took a photocopy first which came out fine. I then printed some photographs (attached) which are pretty decent (though not as bright as originals but not totally unexpected). I didn't try the scan but should work fine seeing the way photocopy worked.
Looking forward to using it.",5
"Liked -
1. EPSON Packaging. Made it survive the Amazon manhandling. Damage sustained to printer would have greater because of the bad handling by AMAZON.
2. EPSON Service. On time & efficient. Complete diagnostic check by rep. Patiently answered all queries repaired, help set up the complete printer and explained all very nicely.
3. TIP - Ask the Customer Care to give you the service centre's details and call them up. Register your product on EPSON Site. MOST IMPORTANT.
4. Ink dispensing bottles. Spill proof, unless you really wish o go to battle with them, easy to use. Precise quantity.
5. Design/looks without opening the paper guidance and the paper tray is very neat. Build quality is fragile.
6. Print Quality is good. Print speed is faster than other ink jet/ tank printers.

Did Not like -
1. AMAZON did a very poor job of packaging it. It was just covered with cling film, not even bubble wrap to avoid vagaries of transportation. Which probably resulted in the defect.
2. Long time to install, makes all sorts of noises. It definitely takes more than the 10 minutes......
Extremely Noisy printer. Everyone will know you printing !!!!
3. Installation of drivers only through CD. Was unable to upload from Net. It did update almost all drivers from Net once installed.
4. The build quality is extremely fragile. if you happen to drop something on it.....God Help you. But on the other hand it survived the Amazon manhandling. Will reword...It feels fragile.
5. The gear in the scan/photocopy section was misaligned. Had to call EPSON Service Centre to resolve. Scanner section had to be opened and the gear realigned.

SUMMARY - Buy it from your local dealer, better option. AMAZON is getting cheaper by the day. ZERO security packaging from Amazon. And get an EPSON service representative to set it up for you.
Its not meant to be transported once opened, too fragile for that.",3
Excellent print quality on Photo Paper. Very fast on normal standard mode on A4 paper. Little cumbersome to install all it's various software options. But eventually it even prints worldwide after proper email setup. Network is off by default and requires a PC/Laptop to properly link to your wireless router. WiFi direct on phone does not recognise some folders on internal memory of my Note 9 although it detects the sd card properly.,5
"Forget plug and play tho it said direct wifi. in fact, each device needs a long set up and it does not support Mac airdrop. I had Epson technician to install. It took 3 hours working on an iPad, a Mac and an android phone, And still did not work.. seems only Epson models above Rs.25k will. They really should disclose the problems.. it seems they are not new. A waste of everyone's time and then had to uninstall the vast amount of software that the technician had loaded to try to get it to work. So be careful .",1
High quality prints and very easy to use. However colour copy is a bit lighter than the original printed sheet,5
"Tried every thing as suggested online. No relief. Have not been able to use it for what it was bought.
Still waiting and waiting and waiting for the local Technical service to attend to it. Local service tried to help online but nothing seems to work.
Previous L210 performed flawlessly. This L3150 one has given me a bad start.
EPSON needs to handshake with Microsoft OS at company level and make it easy to install its new products. Driver loading is a big problem. Down loading Driver updating etc from EPSON website also did not help.",1
"I was looking for a reasonably priced printer for home use (kids projects, occasional letters, photocopies, scanning documents) and zeroed on this model after recommendation from some of my colleagues. After using this printer for more than a month I should say I am pretty satisfied with the printer's performance.
Positives - seamless wireless printing, easy set-up/ installation, convenient options for printing (low/ high/ average quality prints)
Cons- none as of now, except the absence of a sorter makes things bit cumbersome (single page scan/ photocopy at a time)",5
"Dont buy this product from amazon, there is some issues with the piece which we bought..better to buy it from retail store. The one which we received having problems with print quality...color are getting scattered. Raised complains with epson..not sure how soon it will get resolved",2
"I have been using this printer for couple of months now. I have another brand single function printer too, the quality of documents printer from this is not at par with other brands. The printer stops prints abruptly inbetween a print operation and WiFi direct is not reliable. I contacted technical support who inturn assigned me a service engineer who was of no help to me. Printing B&W photos gives a blue tint or greenish tint and I have retorted to online printing for the same. Some of the photographs come out with poor dynamic range whereas my old printer could handle anything thrown at it. The software is sub par and looks like some cheapish Chinese alternative softwares and not one supplied by a professional printer manufacturer. If you just want to do casual printing with a mix of photographs it's fine, if you are looking to print on a day to day basis then look elsewhere!",1
"Worth the prize,
After a reading lots of negative review only trusting on brand i purchased this printer. Print quality is great.
Keep in mind, you have deal with this printer patiently and delicately. This is not lesserjet kind of printer. It will print thousand of pages 7 to 8 years if you use patiently and gently.
I used l210 epson nearly 7 years, now moved to this. Worth the prize",5
I have purchased this printer in July 2020 and in December I have an issue with printer output as the output is very light and not visible. I have contacted Epson on their call centre and they told that the warranty on this product is expired. I have argued with them that this is purchased only 5 months back but they are saying check with Amazon or write to our help desk will revert whether to give service or not. I have never expected this kind of goof-up from Amazon. It is the seller's responsibility to inform OEM to update the sale date and warranty covered to date. Very unpleasant experience and stop buying vale products from Amazon,1
"The only pro about this printer is easy to install. The printing quality is not that great. This printer worth this much amount is not worth it. Buy canon or BB, they are much more effecient.
Now coming to it's main part, aftersale service. Every product now and then needs repair or some maintenance, however, this particular stopped printing colours after 12 months just after the expiration of it's warranty.
The customer service took almost 15 days to respond or even book an appointment. Till date I have not received any service of this product and I probably have to invest in a better inverter. Would rather go for canon which has an amazing after sale service.

0 star for service and 2 star for EPSON.

Hope you all take an informed decision.",1
"Product is amazing. Amazon prompt delivery as usual. Packing is good. Product is as mention with accessories.
Easy to install. You can install printer by referring to you tube videos or can ask Epson service engineer for installation. Refer to epson website for support. Wi fi direct is awesome can easily use to print directly from mobile also. This product is high in demand and is perfect for home and small office use. print copy scan 2 sided print good colour reproduction, variety of features.",5
"The installation with the cd provided was a very long procedure. The instructions provided with are very limited.
The wifi installation instructions made me reset my router which ultimately ended the internet service.
Finally made it...but the wifi connectivity is not good. It takes a lot of time to connect.

The price difference is almost 3000 rs between USB & WiFi.

The plastic looks very cheap.

I have had hp & epson inkjet earlier which was quite strong.

After considering all the above issues I decided to return the product.
Thanks Amazon for processing the refund.",3
"Let's point out some pros and cons...
Pros:
1. Prints quite fast, at about 10-15 ipm (b&w), depending upon the contents of the pages.
2. Scan quality is excellent, almost like a photocopy.
3. Ink consumption is very low, printed over 3k pages so far in b&w, still 1/4th of the black ink is left.
4. Prints sharp and vivid images, excellent for photo printing.
5. Easy to refill ink tanks with spill-proof ink bottles.
6. Mobile printing (wireless) is easy to connect and use, contains most of the features of desktop printing.
Cons:
1. Unlike laser printers, print quality for small fonts is not very good, pixels are observed on the edges of the latters if looked closely.
2. After switched on takes some time to initialize, sometimes it's annoying when you are in a hurry.
3. Not a very compact design, outer parts are not so tightly attached to the body.
Final conclusion: In spite of a few drawbacks it's a very efficient and smart printer for home and commercial purposes. Suitable for heavy usage (over 1000 pages per month).",5
"I purchased this. But it was not feeding paper.
Also the top openable door in paper feeder came out from printer.
I searched in youtube for the seller Appario Retail, and found that many customers are facing problems from this seller.
Now I have contacted Epson support. Their support said they will come next day. On the next day they postponed it to another day. Again on the next day the same happened.
So I contacted amazon for replacement.
I got the replacement. Paper was feeding and I was happy, even though the plastic quality is cheap and easily bendable.

But after usage 2 - 3 times, new problem came. Paper is getting stuck. Paper is stuck and crumpled
Now I am again unhappy spending this much money and having these problems. I won't recommend somebody to buy this printer. Would suggest to buy some better model instead of this entry level item.",1
"Print quality good most of the times but sometimes pathetic with horizontal lines....

Very difficult to set up Wireless connections both connecting it to wifi and using it through wifi direct.

Epson being such a big brand has bugs in its software... Anyone installing the software can know the wifi password of the laptop as it is very visible right in front after the driver is installing....

Also it was an uphill task to connect it on the wifi network...
Epson needs to step up their game and make installation user friendly...

Furthermore, android app lacks option to print desired particular pages.... In order to print 10 different pages we need to give 10 different commands... Or else we have to use the laptop to print 10 pages in one command....",3
"Good Epson quality. Easy to set up. The wifi setup instructions are quite easy to follow. There is also enough help available on Youtube, etc. Quite economical printing. No more refilling or purchasing expensive ink cartridges. More than enough for a home or a small office. Print speeds for colour docs are not that fast. Also the lack of a feeder arrangement for scanning makes scanning multiple pages tedious as you can scan only thru the glass. Wifi printing is a boon as you can print directly to the unit without depending on LAN. To print from your phone you might need the app though.",4
"Even though I'm a technology literate, I chose to call the official Epson engineer to install the printer and they visited within 24 hours.

Installation process was very smooth and print quality is good enough for a regular home user who needs a print here and there.

Printer is easy to install, ink is enough for filling up the tanks well. WiFi is easy to connect and it a smooth ride to print from laptop or phones.

I recommend using Epson I Print app for ease.",5
"When self installing the printer - You have to Charge the Ink after filling. Step 11 of Section 2 "" Charging Ink"". To do this after powering on the printer for the first time (and the power button LED has stopped blinking - you have to Press the Triangle button for 5 Sec - The Power LED will start blinking again - This blinking will continue for 10Min - You have to wait. At end of 10 Min the Power button will stop blinking.

Do not try test print option - i.e. Press Button 1, keeping it pressed Press Button 2. - It does not work. & in the process of trying for Test Print, it will exhaust your ink w/o printing.

The Installation guide states the self filling will stop when the ink level reaches the top bar in the tank.
It does not stop, instead it fills beyond the top bar beyond the transparent window of the tank.
One gets anxious if the tank will overflow. That did not happen.",5
"The printer was delivered to me on 24th Aug and I called the Epson customer care for installation. Due to Covid, the installation happened a week after and the engineer told me that the parts of this printer are defected and that I must replace it with Amazon. Amazon has a 7 day replacement policy and because this didn’t get installed on time, they are refusing to take it back. I am left with a brand new printer with defects and will have to get my printer repaired by Epson. Horrible customer service by Amazon. Please think before buying such expensive items from Amazon. It is better to buy from a local supplier for a little more who ensures replacement and service.",1
"Great printer, was very easy to setup earlier it takes some time around 10min but then works smoothly and also the WiFi is very easy to set up,you will get a print out of your password and you need to connect your phone with your printer using that password once its done your good to go ( sorry forgot to mention please install EPSON IPRINT in your phone then you can be able to print using the WiFi from your phone)",5
"Using this printer from last almost one year . I received it on time and nicely packed. To connect, it is not very easy because there is no digital display.,But managed. Print quality is good but speed is slow, but for average home use it is good. To refill ink it is very easy. Although I haven't refill it since purchase as I print 20-25 pages average in a week.
Right after one month of purchase it had some technical problem and it stopped working. The scanner cum xerox part of machine was faulty which need to replaced. But I must say epson customer service was good . Within 24 hrs technician came to my home . Although to get the faulty part it took some time , but Epson took care of it. Technician was good and he explained me everything . Since then no other problem till date . Its works perfectly well with phone or laptop, android or apple.",4
"I used the printer for around few months and printed only few documents, but all of a sudden the Printer stooped working 3 weeks back, in fact it was not powering up. The local service center replaced the supply unit but still it was not powering up and so suggested to replace the logic board. It took around 3 weeks to get the board. I even had to sent an email to Epson's escalation head to get it at least in 3 weeks.. and when the next engineer came and just switched on the printer without doing any repairs, and it suddenly started working... hmmm... strange.. now it is under observation... but I have printed many assignments of kids that were pending during the past 1 month... It looks good and back to work now... lol.",2
The product packing was so so good that i didn't even have a doubt on the quality of the product. But when the Epson technician came to install the printer. He noticed that it was damaged and the key functionality which moves the belt from left to right isn't working and it's a faulty peice. He was ready to get this repaired but didn't had a spare part with him. I decided to return the product as I didn't want to use a faulty printer. Very bad experience with epson and will never ever opt it. Beware guys when you order this product.,1
"Using for non-commercial personal domestic use.Very easy to use this MFD and printing speed is good.Only thing to be see is how long the ink will last as the claim of tghousands of pages in one set of bottles does not seem realistic.What is a bit inconveniencing is that if the printer is not used for a week or so,it needs head cleaning again which may result is ink wastage.But for these,it is an excellent buy ,especially the ink is in tanks and not in the form of ink cartridges,which used to be exorbitantly expensive.",4
"with everything turning digital and wireless, this was huge jump for me to switch to wifi printing. this product is extremely user friendly be via mobile app or laptop. not to mention the easy of keeping the printer at one end of your house (within range) and not bound by wire length to connect.",5
"I have no idea what these low rating reviews are talking about, may be they got some defective product which certainly was replacable..apart from that, the product is great..working perfectly fine..had hundreds of prints in first month and it has no issues regarding prints and scanning..Photo printing quality is also great..
I mean I have used L805 model as well which has 6 ink colour tanks and this one with 4 colour tanks is no lesser than that in print quality, just the thing is, you got to know which paper to use..
Yeah the build quality looks little loose or lighter, but hey, you don't have to carry it in your bag, it just restes on your table and keeps printing..",5
"Each and every time before print I have to go in maintenance section and have to do nozzel cleaning, head cleaning,power cleaning due to blank pages of monocolor.and color print is also get printed half and incomplete. Please guys do not buy this product.I suggest that go for other brand.i bought this product it is not printer it is tension.
i take print on glossy photo paper but result is like news paper quality.
the rate of paper print is very slow.please please please do not go for this product.
The brand is making fool to customers. .",1
Biggest drawback - No display. Better one is L4160. One need to remember how many time copy button has been pressed to know the count of photocopy. Setting up wireless was time consuming and difficult. Remember don't plug USB cable if u want to set up wireless connection. Print quality is good for documents but for picture it's poor. Speed is OK. Price per print out is inexpensive (USP). I think it would be better to buy laser printer in this price. My previous printer was of rs 7500 was better than this in all aspect except it did not have wireless and price per print out was expensive.,2
"Product is very easy to install. If you print on glossy paper you will get as per your expectations. But if you print on normal paper, it will print average. But it is a great thing right? So that only it has gotten the name 'Eco Tank' printer. Scanner is awesome. With this scanner you can get readable pdf file (not as photo), photo and normal pdf file (as a photo). It supports various types of papers. Overall, it's really good to have the printer like this at low cost compared to others in market.",4
"Delivery from Amazon was prompt.

Installing the printer is breeze. The information pamphlet provides the steps to be followed and it took around 15-20 minutes to complete it. Configured WIFI-Direct option and have been using it with the Epson iPrint app. The quality of printout looks decent. Tried both colour and monochrome. Copy function is working well too. Have not tried the scan option and printing photos.

To the not so good part, the build quality is simply plastic nothing much to mention here.

And, they have mentioned that any non-genuine or non-epson ink may cause damages which is not covered by Epson warranties.",3
"This is a decent printer that with a poor interface and buggy software especially for Mac users. The app is also not very good and in fact I regretted changing to this printer.
The primary reason for changing was to have cheaper printing due to ink tank technology and that part works well.
Here are some issues
1. No duplex printing for Mac and manual for Windows
2. Poor software that’s not intuitive
3. If pages get over in between a print, the command has to be given again as it forgets the remaining pages.
4. No screen in the printer so connecting to WiFi etc take some efforts.

Not recommended

PM",3
"I am giving review after using it couple of times. Overall performance is good. Plastic body quality is just ok, could be better. If you are use-to with IT stuff then installation wont be any issue, but if you are not familiar then you should call for installation. Print quality is very good or I would say Awesome and fast too. Does the work for which you are buying it for. A small manufacturing issue I had is that power port is loose and goes inside when I plug in the power cable. But as an IT guy I am use to such issues to fix it so not a big deal for me. But yes if the plastic would better this wont happen I guess. One more thing! don't forget to register product on Epson website for warranty within 14 days of purchase. No one will tell you or remind you to do it. I think that performance wise this is best then other company printers, Also it is an oldest ink tank technology printer company. Don't worry go for it. (I will give another review after 7 month usage and also upload detailed video for installation DIY)",4
"One of the best all in one inkjet printer.
Before buying I have done lot of research, either I should buy canon or Epson finally I made a decision & bought epson.. now I am using it from almost 2 months it is working flawlessly. Print Quality is extraordinary.. Print at very very less price compare to any other brand products... Simply go ahead and buy this printer... 🖨😊",5
"Connectivity is good. I could print from my mobile, Ipad and also from Laptop. Best part is even when you are not using that regularly, Printer performed well. After staying idle for 20 days, I directly printed some photos on Gloss paper. They looked fine. You just need to adjust some sharpness in the Printer App before taking photo print.
Back and forth printing is manual here but it is ok. For a home printer, it has reached my expectations.",4
"It claims that printing cost is 7 paise for black and white and 18 paise for color. For printing 20 pages of black and white prints, it consumed more than 25% of black ink. Printing cost comes around Rs.2.00 per black and white page. These printing cost claims are total false. Amazon should make it return eligible.",1
"I bought this printer in March end. So am writing this review after about 20 days of intermittent usage.
The print quality is good both colour and black and white. The speed of printing is also good.

However what came as a surprise is that the printer doesn't support even manual 2-side (i.e. duplex) printing.
Even basic HP/Cannon Inkjet printers (between 3-5k) have always had the manual duplex printing support, so didn't even think of it as a feature to check.
This is really disappointing. Spending > 10K and getting a half baked printer missing basic functionality.

Amazon - You should also clearly specify the product features. You litter the page with so much related stuff but don't clearly specify the current product features for customer to understand in a crisp manner, what one's getting and what's missing. I am disappointed with your website too.",2
"This printer is one of the best printer in this price range which gives us a good quality print of both black & white and colour too. Is installing is also very easy which you can do by your own and also easy to use. In my point of view, this is the best colour printer among others in this price.",5
"I have purchased this printer a few months ago. It looked all good until I started printing Letterheads and Bills on this printer. The basic job of any printer should be to print on normal as well as bond papers with equal ease but I was so wrong. This printer is not able to print on letterheads and even on pre-printed bills. At first I thought there is a problem with the printer so I called up for the service guy. The service guy came and he was adamant that Epson does not provide any warranty for Bond paper printing and he was not ready to listen to my problem rather he was too busy to just prove his point that a Bond paper could not be printed with this printer. So, yes the experience was pathetic.",1
"I will give overall no star to this printer , apart from numbers of star given for print quality, installation and wifi connectivity because just after using 15 days or so error massage by continuous blinking of the last lights indicating to replace INK PAD. If this is the standard of Epson printer then I made a big mistake to choose this printer. I have been using printers to generate reports since the last 35 years using several HP, Samsung or Brother printers. This is for the first time that any of my printers behaved like this. Still I have using 2 other printers of 2 years old without any problem. I would NOT RECOMMEND EPSON to rely on. I made a mistake.",1
The printer is good and easy to install only on Windows. Since my Primary machine is Mac I had to return it back. The support team is horrible. Call Centre is worst they can't even speak English and too busy to talk. I ended up teaching Tech Support guys who visited my home teaching the fundamentals of Mac. Tested the features on my Windows it went well. The printer is simple and good but Epson need to work on it's Software and a lot on it's Customer Support hire some good engineers and pay them well.,2
"Paper jam problum and time taken in printing.
I am no happy.",3
"The printer is good but expensive for the services it provides as scanning and faxing is hardly used these days. However, others giving the same services are even costlier. Therefore, it is considered to be value for money in the same category.",4
Very useful.No need for technical help.easy to install.the print quality is very good and clear.I have printed more than 3000 copies from the cartridge and some ink was still there but I refill it again.In my second experience the number of printing copies increased.we need to regularly take the print to avoid the ink to become dry otherwise we may go for nozzle check process.,5
Good product... 1st time use..After few days will update full review....,5
It always shows paper jam and never prints. It really tiring. Need to give command 15-20 times to print paper. Not at all user friendly. WORST BUY.,2
"Review on 1 day of use...

Very compact and economical product from Epson. Asusual Amazon delivery was on time, but poor packaging, Epson carton had a deep cut but thankfully product was safe.

Procuct:
1. 5* for printing quality
2. Amazing output, fast printing
3. Colors are rich
4. Very smooth operation.
5. Epson iprint mobile app works easy for print scan and copy operations.

Cons: Duplex printing is not available. Manually we can change paper sides ans print.",4
not buy epson l3110 model,1
"This printer is the best I ever used it is light weight, has a huge ink tank and it's very easy to use. The bottles that came with it just have to be inverted over the tank and automatically fills it compared to what I had before this is so convenient. The print quality is excellent, it prints on a variety of paper types including glossy paper.

One of the most convenient features would be printing over the wireless network through a smartphone or a computer for services like scanning.",5
"I was trying to setup printer after 6 months of delivery. It had lot of issues later came to know Epson Technician that 2 parts are broken from inside and can not be covered in warranty. I had to spend extra amount to fix it.
Very disappointing .",1
"Prints well, but WI-FI configuration sucks! Called an engineer who also struggled on mobile connection. After he left I am still struggling with my laptop and desktop connection! Got a replacement...and this one has a faulty paper sensor! Now working with Amazon for refund!",2
"Bought this as Epson specialises in print head technology and read that heads do not dry off quickly. Read about horrible installation experiences and Wifi connectivity issues, but my experience so far after a months use has been good. Print and scan quality is good. Also printed 4x6 photo on glossy page. Looks amazing. Don't go by the page yield numbers. The ink seems to get consumed faster.",4
"VERY BAD PRODUCT DONT BUY IT
IT HIGHLY MORE INK USED IN THE PRINTED AFTER THREE DAYS THE INK TANK IS HALF
MORE CONSUME INK AS WELL AS OTHER PRINTER NOT A GOOD PRODUCT PRINT QUALITY ALSO NOT GOOD

"Every brand is going downwards for there new ink tank printers,
This printer has a big issue in printing photos, it starts printing config page in between printing command printing photos on corner, that wastes time and paper also, dissappointed",1
Worth for price and super printer for easy to use,5
"Giving it a 4 star because it has driver issues while connected via USB in windows 10, sometimes device is not recognised ( Don't Know if its windows problem or printer problem).

1. You can see the printing quality from the above pictures (Printed on normal A4 paper, quality may improve on Glossy paper).
2. Free installation done within 2 days.
3. Scanner quality is awesome.
4. Ink cost is low compared to other printers.

Note :- I will update the review after 90 day use,
about customer support and any other technical issues.",4
"Product received was nicely packed and received on time. I couldn't install or operate the system because delivered product was not working and required to call technical support team. Thank God they attended my phone call and solved the major problem by replacing its motherboard.
I highly suggest that please never try to purchase this item through online. Please always purchase after proper checking from authorized dealers only

Samrom Lugun",4
"Installation:- make sure to call for the installation as the installation process is cumbersome.

Print quality:-Print quality is just good nothing incredible, I haven't printed any photos on glossy photo paper so cannot comment on that.

PrintPerMinute:-Don't just look that it can print 33ppm the ISO standard is 7-8ppm that's what you gonna get for A4 size

Photocopy function:- no problem in photocopy function

Scanning function:- scanning and saving to the PC is slow takes quite a bit of time",3
"Bought this printer after a lot of research...
Pro:
1. Wireless
2. Good Print Quality
3. Economical on Ink (Ink tank)

Con:
1. The WIFI configuration is time-consuming
2. Some ink spill from the bottle (not the Printer)
3. Scanner scans only A4 ...size upto legal would have been better.",4
"Printer I received was a return product i.e it was ordered by another person then he returned it. Then the same product was sent to me. Previous customer invoice was still inside the box. He ordered 2 months before.Due to this I lost 2 month warranty.
I didn't expect this from Appario retail Pvt. Limited seller.

Now for printer

It is an excellent product. Print quality best.
All ink bottles were sealed pack. All seal tapes were there. It takes about 6-8 minutes for setting up the printer.
That is why I didn't replace it and I was also in desperate need of a printer so I kept it.",3
"Worst printer for printing via mobile, bought it coz I don't have laptop so wanted to print using mobile phone but print speed is too slow, like one color page taking around 2-3 min. I requested return and guess what, Amazon issued refund, thank you Amazon. If you want to buy printer for mobile, go for higher variant but not this one.",1
The printer sent by seller was un functional the seller smartly inserted the ink in the printer and also sent the empty colour ink bottles with the printer.Actualy printer was not in working condition and it may be returned by somebody else and seller sent it to me as a new printer even without the repair. The printer I received was not sealed pack it was actually opened and even without proper thermocol packing,1
"Initial Comments - Needed a printer that could support both windows and Mac. This one fits the bill.
Pretty smooth installation for Windows - picked up my home wifi router without any issue, and the printer
's own wi fi works fine as well
Installation on mac was a bit longer - for both Mac OS 10 and Mac OS 11 - the drivers are not pre installed. You need to go to the L3150 series page on epson website and download the driver. Once installed - it picks up the printer smoothly. In less than 30 minutes - i was able to print from 2 windows laptops, 2 Macs and 3 Android mobile phones.
Epson iPrint app is fairly smooth on the mobile phone. You could choose the page layouts, number of pages, etc with simple swipes.
Filling in the ink is easy enough, the ink bottles are spillproof.
All in all - fairly utility printer, smooth installation, and importantly worked smooth across devices.
Would get to know the longevity of ink and per page cost over the usage, and would update the review later.",5
"Promise is two business days for installation.

It's been 5 1/2 working days and still no sign of person who will come to install. I called everyday to be told will happen tomorrow. Finally 3 busines days later the central help line number gives me local service centre number. And ask me to follow there directly.

There too story is same. Will come tomorrow. Today the agent gives me a missed call.. (cut in few rings) and then leaves me sms I am sick cnanot come today will come tomorrow.

When I call him to asl what garauntee he will come tomorrow, he shamelessly says.. if you want garauntee call service centre and ask them to send people.

Still waiting to see if installation happens. I am tech savvy can do installation myself.. am only worried about me opening the box.. finding an issue / defective piece. And having to fight that problem was since beginning.

Really poor installation service.",1
"First thing I checked is where is it manufactured, glad to find it is made in Phillipines. Setup was simple, some YouTube videos helped. Print quality is good and printer is simple to use. The application downloaded on mobile works like a charm via Wi-Fi. It is very light weight, and build quality could had been better. Found plastic flaps delicate and need to be handled carefully.",5
"Good printer but faced little problem while instaling cuz i did not see the guid
Rather ots a best printer.Printed more than 100 still ink is not down which is very good
Must buy product
Dont think about oth comments buy it
My paper is over but not ink
Very happy woth product and amazon dor suggestion....
Paper strucks sometimes (1 for 50) but dont need to worry they've got the slot to open stucked paper.",4
The very second month the quality of print started going down and now there are vertical lines all over in the print and photocopy. No logical support to get it corrected. You have to keep searching for the right place to go for availing the warranty. Sorry for buying here.,1
"Tank Inkjets are the best if you are a moderate user. Day to day requirements for home with children- Go for this printer. Very economical and long lasting.
Epson as a brand has worked out well. I shifted from HP to Epson. More value for money. No faltu nakhre!! Company guy came in time to finish and guide the installation process.
WiFi feature is very useful, esp now that most of our work happens on mobiles. Epson can perhaps work on its app interface to make it more user friendly and featureful. Like- Can't give command for all odd or even pages; can't assign a two sided print command etc.
Overall a good model and good deal!!!",5
"Delivery was on time despite lockdown situation.
Packing was ok but could improve a lot like additional cardboard packing on top of the printer box. This could avoid heavy impact.
Though the user guide is available, it took some time to install especially Direct WIFI configuration.
Once the installation is done then it is easy printing via the EPSON app from mobile. Good quality printing.
I still could not ale to install to my laptop due to driver issue. CD comes with the printer is not updated version",4
"I list down the initial setup problems
1. After refilling the ink color print was not working.
2. After running multiple inbuilt self Head cleaning the color print started coming gradually.
3. Still I was seeing missing lines as mentioned in image, then i ran 3 times the head cleaning issue was not resolved.
4. I turned off the printer for 8 to 12 hours and kept idle.
5. I tried printing again it was printing awesome color prints without issues.

If there is a printing issues in new printer it is because of ink flow is taking time, initially I got angry and gave 1 star after running multiple self head cleaning printer is going above and beyond

Giving 5 Star for the Delivery and Product",5
Setting this printer right of the box is a synch except for the WIFI router option. Hence the reason for 4 star. Luckily YouTube has ton of videos to enable your router to recognize the printer. Without doing the step printing or setting up of the driver on your laptop for wireless printing is pointless. Wish EPSON added this as part of their manual or on their driver website. Everything else worked as mentioned in the printed steps and I was up and running in no time.,4
"Over rated and over priced. photo printing quality is okay..

Prints colour and black and white are good.

Seems amazon and epson are selling L3150 model re labelled with L3152.. the booklet come with box has details of L3150 and even the epson print app recognised the device as L3150",3
"Writing this review after using of 2 months of heavy use.
I have a small cyber cafe and I use this printer daily regular basis. Best Economical Printer in this budget.
I recommend to buy everyone.
I have printed more than 400+ pages b/w and ink still remains 70% above+
Color print quality is awesome.
Amazon Delivery service is also quick, safe and fast. Thanks to seller and Amazon team.",5
"* Nice product, working as expected. 4.5 Stars ****
* There as setup time required and it took some extra time, some youtube vedios helped
* The user instructions flier (one sheet came with the printer) shall contain additional information like ""watting time/setup time"" for the calibration of the print head. Got confused as the print head moves left-right with good amount of noise :)",4
"Print quality for black as well colour documents is ok. But print quality is grossly inadequate for printing photos. Print of colour photos look very dull.
This device lacks duplex printing feature which I did not know at the time of purchase. Otherwise, I would not have purchased it.
A printer at a price point above INR 15k not having duplex printing is not acceptable at all. It is very painful to manually print on both sides , especially if the total number of pages is large.",3
Always epson is easy to install but this time firmware problem. Printer is dead for past 2 weeks.,2
"I will list out the problems with this printer

1. Photocopy mode is cumbersome and takes a lot of time
2. Page edges get smudged in many cases
3. You cannot primt multiple pages and sometimes the printer does not print on one side causing a sync issue in case of large amounts of prints.
4. The steps to service it is confusing",2
"Printer is working proper, black ink ok, color print is not meeting expectations, not giving exact colours on normal paper, photo paper i have not printed till now, i will update my review after two days usage. Delicate body. No protective packing by amazon. They sent as company original packing box as it is, no protected packing by amazon. Technical support excellent. Service engineer has installed the printer and give necessary suggestions while i was booked the fre installation slot. Overall printer ok. Should give a protective packing by amazon",4
"During installation when the first print comes out to check the print quality it is a blank page.
And it took almost 3 hrs to understand that the ink light never turned on during installation so until the ink light doesn't turns on only blank page will be printed.
And as per customer care this problem during initial setup is almost 15% and yet they are unable to control this & also there is no information available in setup guide, user guide or in there information support webpage for this issue.
Got this on product in a single day delivery due to urgency & now 3 days passed but no print yet.
And the customer service is of no use.",1
"After sales service is not good. I was facing paper jam issue with my printer.
I logged case with Epson customer support and the executive told me to take printer to service center for repair.
They can't provide onsite support due to covid19. I told them that there is no lockdown in my area and Government has officially announced unlock in Mumbai. But still they did not agree for onsite support.",3
"Print quality is good. Suitable for home and offices. Best thing is you can physically see the ink capacity left out unlike other cartridges. You don't know much.

For home and occasional use at offices, you can forget refilling for atleast 2 years.

Best part is I can take colour prints without thinking twice.... Very very affordable cost per page...

Highly recommend...",5
"Really nice product, if you have set your mind for buy a printer then you can definitely go with this product. It will give you a good printing result in low cost. I really worried about this product when i order this and also about amazon delivery service but both of them made me happy. Amazon delivery service was really fast, although product is outstanding . Thank you amazon",5
"I brought this printer in April, and in July end, it stopped working.
Struggling with service center to get the service person, or address of the service center in bangalore.
Still with in warranty.
Stay away from Epson.",1
I would have preferred the cable and wifi options not to be exclusive of each other and also more simpler way for direct connect. Once used to an approach it is of good utility value.,5
"L3152 It an exact copy of L3150 sold specifically by Amazon. No differences.

It’s fast enough, installation is easy.
Problem with photo printing exists if using >=180 gsm paper. It leaves lines/traces on the paper if gsm 180 or 180+ is used for printing.

Scanning is fast enough that it does not bother. I am yet to test copying/xerox multiple pages.",5
"3150 epson printer is a awesome. I'm fully satisfied for this product. I'm very happy. Value of money. Print quality is a great. And color print quality is also awesome. If you want buy any printer. You can buy this printer. Because this printer is multifunction. And printers Wi-Fi quality is also good. Without any Cable connection you can take pictures and documents..
And thanks to Amazon for good delivery and timly delivery.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍",5
"Writing this after almost 10 months of usage.
The printer has frequent connectivity issues - it gives a communication error and becomes offline. Logged a complaint a few months back and the service engineer fixed the problem with some firmware updates.
Started facing the same issue again for the last few days. It does print after a few tries but the scan option is just not working.
Tried logging a complaint with Epson today, but to my surprise, they don't have any details of my printer [purchase date, serial number etc] and informed me that its out of warranty [It has almost 2 more months of warranty as per the invoice date].
I was asked to send a mail with invoice copy and other details for warranty updation, and now have to wait for them to update in their systems; with no commit on how long it will take.
Really clumsy and unprofessional on their part.
Would recommend to go for alternate options if you can. I personally have had very good experience with my HP desk jet before.
On the plus side, the print quality is good in B/W and acceptable in colour. The one big advantage is the lower cost of printing which comes with the ink Tank option.",2
"Nice and easy to install, have taken a few photo prints on normal paper, came out pretty good. Scanner is also good. Only printing documents from iPhone/iPad a bit complex thru iPrint. You will need to connect an online drive (gdrive, Dropbox etc) to print. Else a good buy. A bit on expensive side considering HP has some some cheaper Ink Tank options. But I was told that Epson has better printer head technology in case of Ink Tank printers. I am a happy customer at least 2-3 days of using the printer. Majorly being used for kids homework assignments.",4
"The printer is easy to install. The Ink bottles are well designed to fit into the sockets and the ink flows smoothly from them to the printer tanks. The user manual should be a little more revealing, it took me some time to realize that when alternate blinking starts, it would continue for a long time like 10 - 20 minutes. The black bottle seems to deplete quite fast even in the standard printing mode, I have ordered an additional one and received it the day after. The pages come out fast and also dries fast. Print quality is adequate. Color calibration is a bit off. I would report back after using it a while.",4
It’s a good product still not facing any problem...,4
Print quality and quantity are very good.. you have to spend at least two hours for your printer installation and wifi connectivity installation..It will test your patience before you see your first print copy via wifi mode...Except the first day horror overall it was a best choice...,4
"I have seen epson L3150, L4160 and L5190 while buying... last decided to take L3150 and my decision is correct after seeing the printer... received in 2 days.. tried xerox- b/w & colour, scan and print from mobile also with WI-FI all options are so easy and i liked this printer and received at Rs.11067/- in great Indian sale... for home or small shop it is prefect and so economic too... find the attached pics of print quality...",5
I bought this printer about 2 months back and hardly used for one or two prints. The ink tank is full but now the prints which are coming are totally messed up. The Ink balance is totally gone and neither I am able to to get black and white print nor color. At such a high cost the printer is a waste. I am very disappointed. Now trying to get help from Epson customer care but as of now not able to connect. Pls don't buy this product at all.... Some time I feel whether we should buy such expensive electronics from online or not.... if the product you bought has become faulty after the return date you are completely in air only.,1
"Very low ppm (3 or 4ppm) as shown in details (33ppm) for black colour. Paper jamming problem again and again. print, scan directly by mobile or laptop or PC. Good Print quality. I don't recommend this printer because of very low speed printing.",2
The Information given on product page is totaly wrong it can only print 2000 pages with an ink bottle which are black and white pages. Print speed is ok if you print in standard quality but not that they are claiming here they should provide right information. The only reason its sells a re high is that they have given wrong information here.,2
"worst experience ever... the printer is really slow but that is still bearable as it stopped working within 15 days of purchase...top of that amazon don't take return or offer replacement... if you want peace of mind and good work, I suggest do not purchase this printer...or else purchase it offline...otherwise you are just dumping a fair amount of money in garbage. good luck",1
After using for a year and once refilled with ink I am writing review. Printer is awesome. No issue. Can be bought without any doubt. Print speed is OK while printing black-and-white papers but while printing colour paper little bit slow but manageable,5
"Unable to get a print out copy. Unable to get the test page print. Thin plastic sheets compartments, afraid they will easily break Old hp printer designed much betterbut 802print cartridges too expensive
And hp personnel interfering with hp printer over internet.",2
Received a defective product. The product was successfully installed but it was not printing anything. Even Epson Customer care support said they cannot fix it unless it was taken back to the service centre. Why should I pay for a defective product?,1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Getting empty papers 🤯",1
"Print quality is good. For me it was not easy to install to use it wirelessly, so I called the tech support (customer care service). Within a few hours their customer care executive came to our place and resolved our queries and problems.",5
"Received it on 29/11/2019. The same day i booked for free installation thru customer care no. From EPSON Authorised dealer they have sent their engineer on the same day for installation. He unpacked the item & explained me & made me to fill the ink & to install. Its very easy. He cleared all my doubts.
The printer was as i expected. But the output quantity i have to check. Color print out is good for normal print. But for photo printing i have to do research about the paper we using & settings.
Important Note: Technician told to take print in a day or 2 Minimum 1 print. And asked not to Switch ON & OFF frequently. If its is office he asked me to Switch ON in the morning & OFF in the evening - Office Closing time.",5
Got a broken Canon printer. Was very disappointed but thankfully had recorded a video during unbox. Immediately initiated a replacement through customer care service. Although had to struggle a bit during replacement but got the right product finally.,4
"Setting up the printer is complicated. Configuring WiFi is very complex and doesn't connect to MAC Book at all. Amazon says 10days return policy but they won't take it back instead they will make you work with Epson's customer care team and work on solving printer problems. If you are ready to spend couple of days debugging and fixing problem on a new printer, you can buy this. The users manual does not have good information about setting up the printer.",1
"Easy to install, compact and biggest plus - wireless.. you can keep it anywhere in your house, doesn't have be closer to your laptop/desktop etc. You can also fire prints from your mobile/tablets using Epson app.. I purchased it mainly for printing projects/worksheets/notes etc. for my kids.. around 5-20 pages per day.. Have printed only 40-50 pages so far.. Happy with the print quality and overall very happy with the purchase..",5
"Print quality is good. However, lot of sound coming while printing the paper. It should be soundless or with minimum audible sound. with price range and available branded products this is on higher side however the after a considerable time we will know whether it is value for money or not. We have called service engineer and it seems it is delicated product and require skill engineer to deal with the product. However we have not faced any trouble with the product and so far satisfied with the product.",4
"This is the worst printer I have ever had. I have an experience of of so many printers. But this didn't work for me. Build quality is poor, prints are average and now it's not working within short span. I am busy person and don't have time to call and ask techie to come n repair instead I would prefer a new one.",1
"Worst product.. We have purchased this printer on June 3 and since then we didn't get a good print from printer. We have been complaining to exchange the printer and the technical team keep on asking us to repair and sending technician, they changed the parts of printer as well, however the issue didn't get resolved. After 2 months we asked them to change the printer as the time is passing by this only and then they said its been two months and it can't be changed anymore. In the very first month when issues does not get resolved with the technical team we ask them there only that to replace this printer, however they keep on suggesting us to get it repaired or replace the parts.",1
"BEST PRINTER, SCANNER, XEROX ALL IN 1 MUST BUY RECOMMENDED, LOVED THE PRODUCT, EASY TO USE ONCE SETUP. QUALITY VERY AWESOME. THANKS ALL THOSE WHO R INVOLVED IN THIS. FAST DELIVERY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5
"Despite all the apps, this printer is not very easy to work with on wi-fi. Used it sparingly, but regularly, still had to call customer care multiple times. However the issue now is that nozzle is blocked for the past several months. It is exactly one year and it is out of warranty.",3
"EPSON-L4150 product can only connect 2.4 GHz on WIFI.
Most of recent WIFI is above these and EPSON printer will not coneect to those WIFI Router/Access point.
It will become useless with only wired connection for printer.

Suggest not to buy this EPSON , they are still age old in networking/WIFI connection",1
"It's a very good printer. Refill it once and it comes for a long time. We can even print photos if you have photo paper. Only flaw is we can't scan Legal size Documents. It would've been useful if ""No. of copies"" button is also given. If you need 10 copies of a document, you have to press the copy button 10 times.",4
"Purchased this and been using from few days. Recommended over HP and Canon, dont go by big names, this printer will outdo both brands at the same price products by a good margin. Only let down is Photo quality on gloassy paper - which is above average, not great. here is a short review:

Pros:
1. Budget All in one printer
2. Easy to install
3. Great print speed
4. Good quality prints/scan/copy

Cons:
1. Photo on glossy or matt paper are okish. They are slightly above average.
2. No Display
3. If you are looking to print photoes regularly, this is not the right printer, but for all other use - its great",4
"The slowest copy print I ever experienced, it stops and takes 30 sec to print the the second print. Need lots of patience to use thise Epson L3110. performance of the printer is not satisfactory for tree price I paid for.
I would rate only 2 stars.",1
"At price point Product is good.
Print quality is good.
It can print 180GSM photo paper just fine.
First unit which I got has Manufacturers defect or firmware problem then I replaced in just 5 Days.
Printer is Good but don't Update Printer Firmware. It May damage it seriously.",5
"Easy to install and print quality is also good. Have printed 40-50 pages so far and the quality is good. One difference though, black and white print looks crisp on black ink than with the combination of color ink. Latter being bordering on grey-ish color.
Installed it myself and then registered the product on Epson India website for warranty purposes.
Good purchase so far!!",5
"Scanner not working. Didn't checked the feature before the return window. Now have to check the warranty options. Poor technical support!

Update: Technician came and fixed one inside loose cable. Seems a delivery issue.

Update: bumped up fron 1 star to 4 star...",4
"Good printer, doesn't use much ink. It came with a scanner defect so i called the CC and they sent a technician and he took the printer to repairs and fixed it but when the printer came back it was so dirty and full of scratch marks. The quality of handling should improve. Over all its a very nice printer, faster than my previous laser printer and works on inverter too.",4
"Haven't used it much yet... so wouldn't know it's qualities so soon..... however the printer is just as described by the seller.... ink bottles are provided, cable provided, instruction manual with driver CD.... not too big in size ... occupies little table space... promises to be a very big cost saver.....anytime a better deal than buying cheaper printers with ink cartridges....",5
The print quality and printing speed is good. But epson software UI is not attractive and it take more time to scan documents. Scanner software is way outdated. I will buy HP next time and not epson.,2
"First of all the no of pages it prints is wrong black and white it will print approx 2000 only.they have mention the speed and pages for draft mode only I think (which is not good at all),speed is like 18-20 ppm for black and white in standard mode ,rest is fine.
Note - the ink is not wash proof on A4 paper.",4
I want to cancel my order as the functions of printer does not meet my expectations... Epson printer installation person come and before he take the printer from the packed box we have asked a one function in printer and he said it that this printer does not have it that function...so we just request him not to take the printer from the box...Now I do not want that printer plz take that printer from my home address I am very thankful for that... as I want a printer with more advanced functions and I will ready to pay the difference amount to amazon or the seller of printer... Thanks,1
"Hi All,
This printer needs very frequent printer head cleaning. Without performing the printer head cleaning activity, you will not receive a proper printout. The cleaning job is time taking activity. Not preferable for home use.",1
"A good printer. Print quality is okay. Speed is also fine for new printer. Should wait for 6 months to see the performance of the printer.
Perfect for a home use. If anyone afford little more money then would refer them to go for little higher version that is l4 series of Epson.
Thanks and regards

"My name is Sudhakar
Epson 3152 printer is very good but very poor quality. Most of the ink is wasted after the printer is initially turned on. Also many times it takes more time to print. The printer I bought recently has a lot of errors. The first of which. Printhead Problem All the lines in the print are coming out. That does not mean that all printers are laid out. Sometimes it can even happen by transport. In any case, I think it's much better to buy on Amazon. The problem can be solved very easily in a very short time.",2
"Epson delivered duplicate ink in which..printer is not working properly.. Neither they are responding nor resolving this issue.. Instead Epson said that we have used nongenuine ink also printer not even used for more than 200 pages, more than 50% ink in the printer tank present but they have alleged that I have printed more than 7000 pages and they voided the warranty without resolving the issue... First they closed multiple cases without solving the problem, service center manager threatened that tell the truth else he will try maximum to void the warranty.",1
"It started issues from the very first month. Wireless connection is functioning good but USB is worthless. I took one service in warranty period but he even could not solve the problem. After one year of using ink problem started. No colour inks are working properly. Called customer care. They asked 850 service charge just for visiting. Parts change costs extra. I have a HP printer, even after 10 years, no problem seemed till today. EPSON is just wastage of money for me.",1
"Little complex for new buyers. The manual provided with the printer explain most of the things but some are not explained. Working fine in summer but in winters it making some issues like paper stuck, auto cancel, etc. Speed of scanning in slow. Not good for business purpose.",4
"Great purchase.
+ Not made in China except for printer wire
+ VFM
+Wireless operation
+ compact size
+easy on ink usage
+ All in one. Scan/copy/print
+ Good print quality

- Slightly slow in operation
-Cannot multi-task. Can't scan and print at the same time
- Initial set up can test your patience. Wireless set up may need help.
- Average build quality. You can't afford to let it slip.",5
"It's a perfect printer pretty easy to install without tech support also

Lastest and greatest updates keep arriving the edge to edge photo feature is best for projects and school/office related work

Would recommend this to students and frequent users",5
Terrible product. Doesn’t work. I don’t even have time to raise support tickets and get this product working in my busy schedule,1
It is not good for photos. There is an issue with color photo print on glossy paper(150/180) GSM. It is leaving roller pressure mark on paper. Once contacted epson. They dont support any glossy paper. This is know issue as technician and customer executive.,1
"Average printer, photo print quality is not as good as canon or HP but normal paper print quality is fine. It disappears on WiFi sometimes and am not able to find it on my apple devices, it takes sometime to appear on WiFi. No AirPrint. Cloud print and WiFi direct works fine. I will say it is an average printer at this cost.",3
Easy to setup and use. Refilling is easy. Anybody can refill. WiFi connectivity is good. Printing quality is also good. I'm using for kids project work.,5
"It's a very affordable and easy to use printer. Uses much less ink than my previous HP 1510 inkjet printer. Wi-fi direct mode is very easy to operate and you can get ur prints directly from your mobile. Colour photo print quality is at par. Printing speed would obviously be less than laserjet printer but speed is fast enough for small amount of pages. Sacnning is little bit slow as compared to other models.

Overall it's a good printer for home use (havent tried printing more than 20-30 pages per day as my usage is low)",5
"Worst product , I bought this product a year before , now am in the situation to speak out,, please help me .. the printer is not working and I reached to service center , they told ""sorry mam , nothing to say . Everything was gone inside the printer,. And the warranty also expired,.So it's good to buy a new printer mam"" .
I have used this printer for a very few times and I had taken minimum to 500papers ..
Frustrated !.
Very disappointed about this product
Please anyone help me out to replace this product",1
I have given one rating because within three months we raised 6 service requests to fix the printing issue finally they changed the motor which pulls the ink then it worked properly and Iam still observing it. I am surprised how come brand new product have motor issue.so my suggestion use the printer continuously to test. Now Iam ok but satisfied as prints are coming properly. Still I dint want to change rating. Because I struggled 3 months to fix issue,1
"The packing and delivery was good. The printer ink was inside the box, easy to install, except wifi connectivity due to driver install failure.. but can still print with wifi Direct by laptop/mobile. Internet connectivity breaks for few seconds. Cons no papaer tray to hold the the ream. Papaer jam happened and had to call technical support. Customer service was good. Good photo pri t on glossy paper. Nice home printer. But I doubt if I can print 300 paper per day. But will sure print a lot of pbotos.",4
Very useful because of school assignments. Picture quality is good and very fast. For Installation company sent college going kids where I spent lots of time and to fixed it later I took lots of time. Mobile printing is bit complicated and some mobile (Motorola) doesn't work some times.,5
"Till now not installed as Epson service center saying they can't install in lockdown.
Review after a month :
Instead in late due to lockdown .But printing is ok..u have to print regularly otherwise head would be jam .",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 It's totally waste of money and time",1
"Worst printer in the world Just after one year it stop printing properly.Service center says head needs to be replaced which is of Aprrox 60% cost of new printer.
They are not made for long run",1
Think twice before buying. Everything was good with the product until it required a service. Its been 2 months now of an unoperational printer. Multiple calls multiple service requests but the service person never arrives. They keep giving you service request numbers and don't actually do anything about it. Thinking of scraping the product and buying a new one. Beware as i have tried all possible ways.,1
"Gave 1 star as that's the minimum required for the review. My Epson EcoTank L3150 Wi-Fi got shipped. The packing itself was not impressive. And there was no surprise when I found its just used product. There are scratches on top and so many dust on the white screen when flipped the top lid. Moreover, the ink bottles provided are empty and used. Applied for a refund and it's approved.",1
"Epson L3150 is good entry level all in one printer. Photo print quality is very impressive.
Customer service of Epson is very good. Initially my printer worked for one day and it stopped printing color prints.
I called epson service center to explain problem and they replace my printer without any questions asked.
One thing i am missing is the lcd screen. Life become easy with on screen instuctions.
The one with lcd screen is about rs4000 costly.",5
"everything seems all right. best one. if you are looking for saving money on inks this is the right product
initial investment is high but for longer runs where you don't have to spend much on inks. go for this product. it has usb, wifi connections which is very handy to print with their app.
If you print 5-10 pages every two/threee weeks
you can go with this product

only con : very light plastic body, could be damaged very easily if not taken care properly",4
"Good printer, must have if you are a photographer or you want to use at home more economical that injet printer.. Print quality is good and colour print is better compared to other brands and yes it's economical.. Go for it and do not mind some negative reviews. At last it a Japanese product not a cheap China product..",5
"It is not easy to install and manual is not great. Instructions should be proper and correct guide for installation.
After installation it takes 3 minutes to wake up and get ready. After that it is super fast.",3
Convenient product at home use. Does Urs job well though sometimes I find the spoiler keeps running but won’t take the sheet in. Maybe it requires some minimum load of sheets in the bay. Print quality is not bad.,4
Printer not working after putting ink and flushing..Lodged complaint to epson yesterday (no. 1007528195 dt 15/6/2020) but till now NO one bothered to come and do installation...Waiting for epson engineer. .. will update,1
"Excellent printer from Epson.. very easy installation, the ink filling is very easy now as compared to older Epson priners which I am also using. The new ink bottles are spill free and with the converter like mechanism on top it's very easy. The printer is quiet and gives good print.the design of paper loading tray has also been changed and I hope it does not skip papers as in previous models.. the previous models had a lot of problems with on off switch, I hope Epson has taken care of it in this model",5
"Best InkTank Printer in the Market Right Now at this price range, Go for USB version as compared to WiFi Version.
You can Print from your Mobile Phone using USB. Best Use and output comes by using a Laptop or Desktop Computer by installing Epson's offcial range of Softwares.
A wide range of things can be done very easily, a big thumbs up for the product.
If you want a InkTank Printer at this price range, go and buy it blindly by keeping ragular maintenance and frequency of use in mind.",4
"Print quality is good for home/student use not good for office use. Read the instructions and do installation, its pretty easy. Just now only bought so not able to comment on the future support and life of the printer.",5
"I did spend a lot of time in selecting an ink tank printer between EPSON, CANON, HP etc. and found this to be cheaper than this. Though this is more sleek and breakable if not handled properly as compared to HP but good value for money. Specifically if you have more than 1 kid or would like to also print office stuff.

My kid like printing his worksheet and enjoys completing them.",5
"The very next day after installation when I gave print, the paper got jammed while giving print for 2nd time. After removing the paper, the nozil got blocked . After cleaning nozil and head thrice, the printer worked. 3rd day suddenly printer not working. All the lights are just flashing. Horrible experience. Do not buy this product",1
Phone printing is much more good,4
Beautiful ❤️ print quality... U hv to know the trick... If u use for pdf print then its awesome... Photo quality nt gd in plane paper... Adding a photo... U can compare and decide accordingly... Though don't expect lab quality print... But its gd for home use..,4
"Writing sincere review after using for more than 01 year.
Print quality is good.
Regular updates are pushed from manufacturer for fixing errors and bugs.
Easy to use, reliable product.
Ink does lasts good, need not to think of using it daily like other printers which have cartridges which dries out often.
Idle for students and office personnel.",5
"😍awSm print quality and very easy to use by wifi ..
value for money 👌🏻",5
Service person who came to install was not having copy of the software to install on central storage. As I have office laptop so couldn't install anything so I can't utilize the printer to the fullest.,5
Mobile printing doesn't give the option of manual duplexing.i had to install third party software for that.also scanning to long pdf file is difficult.problen is not the matching but Epson I print.,4
"Product is good and quite portable.
Ink fillling is quite easy..
Epson Print App works flawlessly..

Print quality on standard mode is average
High quality looks promising..",4
"Even after 2 hours of installation, doesn't print a single page.
There is no such thing as customer satisfaction once you buy it, they will run with your money like thieves.
Just dont buy, it doesnt print anything and Amazon or Epson won't take it back even if you call them within 3 hours of delivery.",1
"I would like to point out following major issues experienced by me.
1.0 I received the invoice without GST number being business invoice. Could not get any help through customer care as there was no direct number to reach the executive. It was all through auto voice and helpless. Please send an invoice to my email ID with the GST number given
2.0 The printing quality is very pathetic. Kindly provide the direct customer care help line to redress the technical issue.",1
The product is very good. Provides lot of options. Technical support is good. Some issues with installation. The manual provided is a bit confusing in some of the steps but watching the installation video helped solve the problem.,5
"print quality is very bad
could not able to print color prints (received defective or not working color prints)
couldn't able to scan and print slightly light content
called Amazon to return this but no proper response
called Epson customer care but no response
My heard earned money totally 13999/- wasted because of this worst printer",1
"Scan from computer function in not working, I tried in three systems same issues.
Manul print on both sides also not working , while printing second side it wont show option like turn page manually.

I don't have option to return product and no help from EPSON service center.

Amazon please deliver only Authorized and non defective products. My amount 11,000 is waste on this product.",1
"Great printer and scanner for home/Office use.
I have scanned over 80 pages back to back and all scans were amazing. I have printed multiple prints in plain ang glossy paper the only issue I faced was that multiple lines were coming in the print. But I got to resolve it with muzzle cleaning options in the Epson iprint app. We need to run the maintenance check monthly.",4
"good product but cannot be compared with laser printer . b&w Printing is good but colour pronting is in very basic level. wifi conectivity is excellent . Service response from Epson is amazing ,the person visited for instalation had very good knowledge about the product and an excellent demo given",5
"Nice product , really worth for the money . I recomend to buy for home for your project and small business. Easy to install the printer .
I used mobile for printing passport photos gthru WIFI its excellent quality",5
"I have purchased this printer last week and installed it. I took few print outs and some photo copies in black and white. During photo copy printer stopped working and all lights are blinking. According to provided manual open the front cover and remove paper jam or swithed off power. I did so many times but problem could not resolved. I also found speed of photo copy is very slow. So, my advise don't go for this product.",1
"Scanning and photocopy does not work .A Thik Horijontal and Vertical
Band appear on scaned and photocopy document",1
Printing quality not good. Paper gets jammed very easily.Was using hp for a decade. Moved to this coz print per paper is supposed to cheaper in epson.,1
"Product as described in Ad. Works well Resolution is very good.
very Good product absolutely no complaints at all. However one suggestion: if paper intake tray could be arranged inbuilt like Brother or Canon printer it would provide an advantage over other printers.",5
"Liked the printer very much. Printer is big enough, just as I wished, print quality is the best of all. User manual and everything else absolutely clears everything about the Epson Printer. I have got the L3152. Thanks for the printer. Dilevery was also well managed.

Regards",5
good but some times are not connecting properle to app and they dont direct conection to mobile we to conect epson iprint app for mobile and some time are printing is leaking some blank ink,4
"Actually the given the used printer. totally disappointed with amazon..
check after delivery printer..",3
Good printer low budget suitable for home and small office and shops print quality is good always use 100gsm paper for print any b/w or colour print and 130 to 180gsm glossy photo paper use for photos print,5
"Worst experience, I followed the instructions given in the pamphlets. But printing is not working and I'm getting blank pages.

I dont see any clear instructions to sort out this. Spending 5+ hours with this.",1
"The worst product ever, we had to keep it close for 15 days and it stopped working. We took it for service and the problem repeats, it doesn't get connected, print quality is very poor, black color doesn't come, who expects a printer to not give a b/w print.
Wouldn't recommend this product to anyone and I wouldn't buy any Epson printer ever again.
I would ask for a payback for this product for its worst print quality and poor connection.",5
"It is super design and dust proof. Value to the expended money ,print quality is also fine",5
"Product delivery is very fast from Amazon during lockdown period as well 5 stars for delivery.
Pros- Printing quality is good both Black and colour.
Setting up the printer is very easy. Just you need to fill the ink follow steps from manual. Boom!!
Cons- Delicate body.. Quality of plastic used feels cheap and very delicate.. if not handled properly, chances are there to break at some parts.",4
"Received in Intime
But Packing was not good from seller, box was damaged but printer was safe
working great
print quality is excellent
easy manageable through web
supports cloud print
can print remotely",5
"Buy on your own risk, the printing experience is so wearied. Let say if i print 20 pages it prints 3 or 4 pages and stops.. very strange behavior. technical support is not responding at all. its just 4 days we purchased. overall rating is good for epson however the printer L3110 is not good",1
"Excellent product from Epson, I would recommend this Printer who is looking for Wireless Printing. We can print from Andriod mobiles as well. The only drawback is doesn’t support IPhone devices. You can’t print from IPhone. It’s not a Air Print Printer. So any Andriod users planning to buy, would suggest and recommend this product. I’m not full convinced with the Technical support.",4
"I have used earlier epson L565 printer compared to that the installation is bit hard process. We tried to install the product on our own but the printer was not connecting on to the wifi, so atlast we need to call the technician for configuring the printer to wifi, but the support was quick and responded less than 24 hours.",3
"At the time of purchase, the Company is advertising that this Printer has Duplex (Manual) printing option. However, it didn't work when I started using the printer. On contacting the EPSON customer care center, I was told by their technical team that This Model do not have Duplex printing support and we cannot help you rudely. Their call center services are pathetic. Have decided to buy Canon and never to buy any EPSON product in future.",1
"Bought this after spending fair amount of time in searching for a good home printer.

So far it's good, print quality is at par with other printers. Just need to see if I gets print volume as promised.",4
"Paper got jammed on first day of use - there is no automated cleanup for this and it is incredibly cumbersome to dislodge (requires removing front screws which I obviously didnt do since it might void the warranty).

Only 2.4Ghz wifi is supported, setup is also challenging.",1
Its now 3 months since I bought this product. Its a highly economical printer(even for color prints). Its not really bulky and also doesn't take up too much space in your study area. Its one of the best Multi function printers for your home or office. Overall a great product where perhaps a better pricing would have made it the best in its segment...!!,4
Good wireless all-in-one printer. Easy to install. Can take print out from mobile phone. Copy is very easy both b&w and color copy is available. Print quality is good (I am using 80gsm paper). Scanning quality is also good.,5
I print only 46 pages but my black ink level decrease by 50% i dont know why but i checking more to understand why it happen. Ohterwise i will contact to customer care to fit it becz company claim 4500 pages in a bottle lets see but u can but it its awsome product for home nd shops also. Dont panic is ink level is decrease just contact and watch because we dont know about the internally function.,4
"Performance is too bad.. print and scan is too slow... By the time it scan one paper, i can scan 3 papers using mobile app... Printer is made with plastic and I feel i need to be more cautious in handling it... Did a big mistake by selecting this printer... No issues from Amazon delivery point of view...",2
"I received my parcel with intact packaging.
Printer is working in good condition. print quaily and speed is very good.
Installation process is very easy.
Built quality needs to be improved by company. Epson provides the lowest printing cost per page in the market.
My overall experience regarding the product is Nice.
Just go for it without getting confused with other products available in the market.",5
"Worst printer ditched me when I needed it the most. Service is pathetic no call center no helpline no. Buy anything but don't buy this. Nozzle jam every week, super slow, irritating delays in print. Only blank pages come out no prints after one week",1
"On registeatuon of product in Epson, it says the product purchase date was 2019 and warranty is expired. I bought thr product on May 2021!!!!

Also, the product has to be cleaned via printer settings every 2 days. Worst product if you are using for home purpose.

Worst experience!!!!",1
"Printing quality as well as settings are very good, However, the Scanner only provides JPG or Images, Not a PDF for multiple pages, that is only a draw back, but if someone is using it for Photo printing/Office printing, its very good. Scanner can not be used to make PDFs, or either I am unable.",5
This printer is good for household and cyber purpose this printer is not recommended for zeroxing more than 100 pages at a stretch A major con is that this does not have wireless printing options,5
"The engineer has visited 4 times and unable to resolve the issue, no replies from epson customer service, phone calls are not answered.
Worst product ever.
dont think of buying this product.",1
"The print quality is great. Only anyone who is installing the printer must have patience and let the printer setup complete in order to let the printer work properly.

This printer is worth buying. I recommend this product.",5
"3 days past my warranty the printer stops working properly. Very disappointed with the customer service. Will never purchase another Epson product.
-Prints fine, nothing great, cost per print is pretty low
-Customer service is garbage (honest feedback)
-Not very user friendly (the printer and the app)
-Mobile app is from the prehistoric age, surprised it's in English and not some random Glyphs.",2
The cd provides a clear step by step process for installation and much more clearer than the youtube unboxing videos. Deskjet printers have a more sturdy build quality and home users could look at them first.,5
"One of the worst printer sold by EPSON. The printer Ink becomes rigid if you don’t use it frequently. More over EPSON won’t take AMC for this model after warranty period because they are aware of the recurring service issue with this model.

I feel cheated after buying this product and won’t recommend others to buy this model.",1
"Very weight less plastic,
Could not take both side print.
Print guality is just ok, it is ok for office use.
After 15 day use paper is not taking, i am searching service partner..",4
"I have informed to customer care for installation of this printer, but till date no one come to install this product. They informed me the product serial no X5ZD261311 IS wrong, for this reason the product is not registered with Epson co. So I requesting Amazon for arrange this product for installation.",1
I Purchased Epson L3152 WiFi All in One Ink Tank Printer. Today I got the Item (03-01-2021). But Printer Not Working. Paper didn't take to print. Paper Feed Indicator is Always Blinking. I Think Deffective Item is recieved. I didn't expect from Amzon. I and my cousins are purchased items from Amazon since 6 years. We are trused Amazon 100%. But today I am very disappointed. I bought this for project works.,1
Not a great printer. In the description it says suitable for small offices. Let me tell you after using it for more than a year it has just printed 3000 pages so it not suitable for small offices. The colour prints gets stuck sometimes without any reason and after 100 prints or so at a time the printer just gives up in Black and white. It ok if you need the printer occasionally. 10-20 pages print per day.,2
"This printer is best for use and heavy use too such as office use, etc.
It has best printing quality with good average of ink
Must buy
But it is having problems connecting wirelessly, and you can only connect a device through its wifi direct and not with your mobile hotspot or router !!!",5
"Don't buy if you don't use printer everyday. Since it has water based ink it gets dried and it doesn't print at all especially black. I complained 2-3 times, technician confirms this issue in the printer. After one year warranty you will have to pay technician charges (about INR 450) each time ink gets dry. So if you don't print everyday and tour usage if even after every 2-3 days don't buy this printer.",1
"everything is fine but warranty is not for exactly 1year, its 10/11 mos... i think it's not a new printer...
be careful...",4
This is a worst printer I ever came across. Within a year it stopped giving print and ink tank also stopped accepting ink as the head was blocked and couldn't get into working condition. Very bad. I spent around ten thousand and couldn't get copies for even ten hundred.,1
"the print quality is great, the prints are super fast and the image quality is great even on coloured photographs but it doesn't synchronise well with apple devices. i miss my old printer :(",4
"No bill of supply received. Talk for replacement of product. Customer support department talks but proper solution not provided. Customer service no. of company provided thrice, no no. is valid. Today RETURN WINDOW CLOSED. Now GOD KNOWS which kind of support they give TOMMOROW. Of course it's easy to install any body use any printer may install it. Easy to use. Print quality is good. But in trial once or twice paper blocked .somtimes start lines become hazzy prints. Overall printer is good.",1
"I thought it to be having a WiFi printing option. But nothing as such. No technical support provided (I am under impresion that someone from seller or Epson would call me, but nothing yet)",3
"Print quality is superb on plain paper also.
Amazon is great
Happy with this printer",5
"Print Quality of black/white copy is average. Colour print is convincing to the average. But at this price you can not expect much. If you have budget more than 11k I don't recommend you to buy this.
Personally I liked the printer very much . It performs very well for your day today business or home use. Printing speed is very impressive.",4
Works OK. Setting up is non intuitive and a a bit tough with so many different drivers on website and then it shows multiple menus from which one has to select,3
Overall it is good small office work because if you copy of documents then after few time there appears delay in copy command.,4
"Printer received after so many days and so many followups as delivery promissed, all setup done as directed. But only one test page got printed after that not printing any page. Always flashing all lights and in computer, status displays as paper jam. But there is no paper feeded. After switch ON and OFF many times it is not corrected.
Please suggest what will be the issue.
Is the product defective?",1
"Very easy to use for copy, print and scan. Only thing is missing wifi printing option. Otherwise filling color is also very easy. Print quality is also good. I love to print photos and documents.",5
Used product was delivered to me. Box unsealed ink bottles empty and printer already in use. Disgusting?,1
"Main problem is on off button.
Some it open quickly sometimes it takes too much Time.

Some time this device do not open pressing.on button.

No digital screen in this price range very sad.

Printer is light weight.

Printing quality is good.",3
"Best printer available in this price range, rather than focusing on economic aspects look after printing quality & speed. Its wireless connectivity is superb allowing you to print from mobile, computer, laptops & also ease access if connected to wifi-router. Refilling is also quite easy and mess free & budgeted refillable inks available in the market.",5
No fuss inkjet printer. Lacks a small display. However it seems to work just fine. Great wifi connectivity. Lacks AirPrint. It can however print through the Epson print app on Apple devices.,4
Print quality is excellent but epson support and software for printing is the worst,3
"I am giving reviews after 4 months. Product is good. But body material is not up to the mark. Ink filling is very easy . Black and white print 2500 pages only maximum. Scaner is good. When you go through continuous 10 or more page to print some problem come, but after 2 min automatically ok. I suggest that buisness purpous dont buy. Go through another's option
Passport size photo is not upto the mark",2
It is better to be used.. print quality is also good. You can adjust quality also by mobile app. All is good but the little disappointed because we can't print A3 size. Little dissatisfied for A3 size.,5
"Please Dont buy, Since 2 days bought this Services no one there to Give us demo, when we connected ourself, its Not working at all. Don't know it going to resolve or not",1
"It's working fine till now!

But I'm not quiet satisfied with the print quality.
Will check after fine tuning.

Currently printing over normal draft paper and glossy photo paper.
It has given some uneven prints.

Will let you know after some months.",4
"I already know about Epson L3110 printing quality because I do photography business, but
Little did I know, however, that the printer would be available through a complete printer installation from the Epson company
That is the greate experience about Epson and Amazon delivery",5
"R Sir, Madam,
Pls note I bought Epson L3110 from Amazon on placed order n 13.2.20,the order shipped on 15.2.20 and deliver to me on 22.2.20, now I am facing issue in printing as print comes out in black and white while send as color print command. I logged complaint at Epson they suggest that your product is out of warranty. Pls help and do he needfull.",3
"Pros
Excellent print quality, nice xerox output, perfect colour balance
No problem if you don’t print regularly
Easy to configure

Cons
Poor build quality, cheap plastic, overpriced",4
"Over all product is nice but customer care service very bad coz they charge in phone call 2.5paisa mint And I send them a request though phone calls for Installation but they did not serious about Free Installation They said "" You Have to wait for 2days for installation"" But The I go to Youtube and saw a couple of videos and Install by self.

But Product Is super",5
VERY GOOD BUDGET PRINTER. NO ISSUES LIKE INK DRYING UP GOOD QUALITY PRINTS. BLACK AND WHITE PRINT QUALITY IS DECENT BUT COLOUR QUALITY WAS VERY GOOD. A GOOD CUSTOMIZABLE PRINTING OPTIONS IN THEIR APP AND IT WORKS WITHOUT ANY ISSUES VERY EASY TO USE. JUST DONT THINK TOO MUCH AND GO FOR IT.,5
"Got defective product,printer was not talking the ink. Also need to return as bill has no valid serial number, epson service team say u do
not got the warranty against this bill.
Why seller is not printing the valid serial number is very doubtful",1
"Build quality of product is very poor. I would say its fragile.Print quality is ok. In terms of feature .it have very less feature for paper feeding .App connectivity is good.
I will update after few more days about it more. Above was first impression.",3
"Excellent print quality.... 💯% recommended for home & small office... I used for more than a week of time and writen the review.. Scan, Copy & Print all scores above 9 oitnof 10...",5
"All is well with printer but Epson needs to work on Wifi Software, many times wifi fails and printing is not proper while using WiFi.",4
I got this product. It was easy to install. After everything done. It was printing blank pages. I did head cleaning and everything still it didn't work. So I returned this product. Thanks to Amazon they helped me to return and refunded the product amount.,1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Packing of product absolutely rubbish
Also my product get little bit dammaged while they
Handling product during transportation or shipping process
The scanner reader stuck inside
That's why the product showning light blinking ( hardware failure)
Then I called a technician
He fixed the problem",1
I bought this item on 11th June and on 22nd June the printer showed hardware problem. I had to call Epson support and the technician said that the mother board has to be replaced. I had faith on Amazon. But feel like cheated this time. Got into trouble just the day after 10 day replacement wondow closed. It's a real pain to see a newly bought item going for hardware parts replacement.,1
"Not satisfactory response so far.. No support yet for installation.. please be careful before buying. Some reviews say it supports wifi print, thoght it doesn't seem to have a wifi option. Self installed at last, prints have black marks on the corners. Waiting for someone from tech support",1
"not so good in this price range, scanning time approximately 1 minutes per page, and b&w xerox timing also 30-40 seconds per page and color print also 1 minutes and above times. description wrong . don't buy.",2
I have used hp printer before this. Printing quality is not better than hp printer and the build quality is poor. It seems like can easily break the plastic if you don't use carefully. Event the locks of the ink tank are also delicate and have to use carefully while filling the ink.,3
"Great Printer, fantastic speed, and very little maintenance. I bought it for ~9.8K, but I am a happy customer. Amazon, as usual, excelled itself in delivery and packaging. And Epson is a name that does not need any introduction or selling pitch in the world of printers.",5
"new one Print Not Clear Printing Problem
2nd time replacement is send used item and print not clear same problem
maybe its manufacture defective or too long manufacturing date 1year ago",1
"The product was safely delivered.
Installation was simple. Follow the installation guide with the product than youtube.
Recommended for home use",3
"Amazon Delivery was good.
Installation was done by Epson technician. He had to virtually strip down the brand new printer to fix some hardware issue due to travel from amazon warehouse to home.

Its working fine now. Can't really write about the performance as of today. But it is on expected lines. Tested it successfully wirelessly with iOS for iPad and Android devices.",4
I have no problem . I use it at home.,5
"Reviewing after some use this product is very good for home and office use, device is proforming well as it is expecting, print quilty and speed is so better",5
The product is expensive. The print quality is very bad. The product's build quality is very low standard and it is looking like very fragile. Overall the product does not perform satisfactorily.,2
"Build quality is very inferior..plastics used is very thin and bad quality..if not used extremely carefully all chances are there ,the parts may broke .print quality not very impressive both colour and black&white..need to check on glossy paper to chick picture quality",3
"Installation - Done.

Primary prints are good.
Filling up of tanks was seamless
WiFi connectivity Might be an issue until you figure it out
Phone App easy - it just pushes out prints at a click
Weight - very light weight, we were surprised

Will update review post some days",5
"Happy with my purchase of the L3150 for my kids' printing needs. Easy to install, works well on Wifi, print quality is as expected. Go for it!",5
"I have purchased it and just after installing one of the parts was broke and technical support refuses to replace it on the location. in the first 10 days, printer broke down thrice. Technical support was very pathetic.",2
I have brought this printer in June. Difficult to configure and you don't have proper manual to configure with box packing. Manufacturer claims it can print 4500 in B&W and 7500 in colour is a false claim. Your printer cartridge would be over in less than 1000 pages for both colour and B&W. Poor printer at the price range sold.,1
"Good product, experience is good so far. If setting up by self for the first time, need to remember that after first power on, it needs about 10 mins to fully boot up.
Only then follow next instructions to enable wifi on the peinter and connect via computer preferably.
Make sure printer is connected to Home WiFi network.
Finally great job by seller on timely delivery!",5
"Poor print quality, very complex in understanding duplex printing, damn slow printing. Better take a demo before purchasing.",1
Installation is a problem.nobody has come from epson till one week .if any product problem we cannot return or replace as replacement time finishes,5
"Worst product , unnecessarily complex installation and EPSON installation support is not at all acceptable, they are in attitude and ask to return the product if I m not satisfied, and worst qyality plastic, jusy dont look at fake 5* reviews.. dont buy it , better buy Cannon or HP",1
I have two printers. One is working very nice. But another printer got a problem. But Epson service is worst. They did not attend. The printer is nice for home use. My experience is with Epson service is very bad.,2
I purchased this for low cost of printing and fast printing speed. The printing speed I am getting is less than 2 pages per minute. So I see no logic of buying this.. thinking to return this,3
Received faulty product. It just doesn't print. Only white printouts. Amazon not provided Refund yet and I already returned the printer. I will buy it from local shop now. Had financial Loss in business due to this faulty printer. Never expected this from Amazon.,1
"The product Epson L3152 sent to me is a 3 months old product and hence the EPSON website has refused product registration since this is more than 90 days old product.

Although i have purchased this on 10-Jun-2020 and delivered on 12-Jun-2020, the warrant shown in website for this product is only till Mar 2021 instead of Jun 2021.",1
"The printer is very good.
Printing speed is fast.
Installing the driver is easy but configuration of wifi is quite challenging. Also instructions given to do so are not very helpful.
But, once configured, you'll be happy with the printer.
I'm using Epson L3150 since 2 months and bought Epson L3152 now. I'm happy with the product.",4
"Overall printer is good but plastic quality is third grade..Let me check print on glossy paper.color printing on A4 plain paper is average..
Why Epson is selling this printer on high price..
At this price range please buy brother dcp710dw.
I have done the mistake but I recommend brother printer for its durability",5
"Dear team,
I had already return complaint for this printer. Anyway this printer is not working properly because we faced print quality technical issue always. I initiated 4 times complaints but always new problem stand ..",1
Very bad experience with L3150. I have attached 4 color prints on photo paper. It scratched whole paper with verticle lines. Zoom photo and you will see small pin holes on paper. Initiated return process. Don't know if problem is with model or with the item only I received.,1
"Installation : Step by step as on installation guide and done. Take about 30 min to complete the full process. No need to be a professional.
Print quality : Just awesome. Excellent quality print with copy power A4 plain paper.
Using process is simple. Can copy with good speed in A4 Size.",5
"Printer is easy to use and easy to charge ink , This printer gives photo lab quality at 18 paise, Thank You Epson And Appario Retail Private Ltd.",5
Recieved defect product even after ink setup is complete lights are blinking. Called Epson customer care they are telling some cable issue. Now the retrun window time is also over. Waiting for customer support guy to vist my home to fix this due to lockdow site visit is temporarily halted.,1
It's good ink tank printer easy to install as per direction only drawback is not having both side printing. It's fast and economical.,5
I have been using epson brand for sometime now. I ordered epson L3152. It was a very poor printing quality. The company says 6000 color printout the talk was 10% empty just printing 25 pages. The tech support was do not consider the printing quality as a technical issue.Not worth the price you pay for such a lousy quality. Please do not waste your money on this product.,1
Complete all in one. Wireless printing is awesome. You can install Epson Print app on any device iOS or Android to directly print.,5
Service is very good firstly I received faulty damaged one but it get exchange very fast. Now it's working but some ink drop at the last line of the page.,4
This is good for printing.but for Xerox it is not good.if we want to take 10 difrent papers zeroz.first 5 papaers comm fast after that per minute it will com only 2.thats why it is not good for zerox service people allso not good.yhey don't know exact problem.they don't know how to solve problem they tell it will done like that sir.we don't do any thing,3
"I would suggest go for hp, the print crispness is not good , very difficult to print from apple product especially app based printout",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 After setting it up all lights are blinking. I have checked the manual, it says for this error code restart the printer and if it still remains contact support. Print quality and wifi connectivity is good",1
"It is a good product. But it after a review of available products and my usage. But, could have bought one with wireless printing to be able to print directly from a mobile phone, tab or even PC.",4
Don't buy this printer .. or any product or the epson . The printer sucks .. i have bought this today and only the blank page comes out. It takes nearly 20 min to start the printer . The page will also got stucked in it once,1
"Were easy to use and cost-efficient, only while configuring it to wifi router it took a while, but again I don't think anything wrong at Epson side, its and perfect product if you want to print daily more than 10 pages.

Color quality is also too good and cost-efficient.",5
No driver is available in the website of epson. You have to download driver of L3110. Every time there are messages while printing that you have chosen a different printer. Very irritating. Not recommended to be bought. Bad product support.,2
Happy with the product. It's made in Philippines. Not in China. My suggestion will be don't try to install it on your own. First time use is difficult a little bit. It consumed a lot of black ink in first few prints. It came to my notice that others also faced the same issue. May be minor technical glitch. It's not a duplex printer. Otherwise okay.,4
"Couldn't have asked for a worse product.... It's a painful struggle to get it running and the tech support is another story.

Never ever buy an Epson.... Never.",1
"Superb Product,
Nice print
Some problems of paper Jam arise but one can handle if one can has minor intelegence,
YouTube will help for any error
Wifi working well with Android phones",5
"Company claims to be cost effective per print. Print quality is good (black/white and colour).

The cost per print compare to other brands is cheaper as per research.
Cost effective product as well.",5
"While printing photos, the printing stops in the middle and the paper becomes waste. This could be a software issue, but it happened with both Windows and Mac. Other than this, I'm happy with the printer",4
"Everything was good but I had call tech support in the start because there was some error shown.
One of the error light was on I tried everything. But then with the help of tech support error resolved.
Driver CD was also empty so my advice to everyone download the drive from the website for latest version.",4
"Please Please Please this is my humble Request Don't buy EPSON Products. If you buy You will crying whole life.

Very very Bad After Sales Service even my New printer is not working from last 10 Days and after a call log for service. No Person visit from service center from last 10 Days.

So plz don't buy EPSON Go for HP or Canon.",1
"Good product , using for printing without a desktop/laptop using only mobile app.",5
"this printer wasted my full day for installing drivers. customer service is poor i hope there will be zero 0 star available.
other wise print quality is ok.
Don't install drivers from the CD in the box.
otherwise you can't print a single word in your whole life.",1
"Most Affordable Best value for Money Printer in the range.
The wifi option helps a lot, If you can stretch your budget a little choose the printer with wifi.
It helps a lot, saves a lot of time in the future.",5
Worst product ever .... the colour print is not working. The tech support is very poor. I have been reaching them for guidance but no response yet ... totally worst service dont buy. You cant even replace it the amazon puts the blame on epson and epson never cares.,1
Worst all in one printer I have ever used. Scanned and copier did not work from day 1. When engineer visited ge advised to replace the part. Entire printer cannot be replaced. Never buy this Epson printer... Worst product.,1
No customer support for instillation.. .. can not print by direct Mobil through usb cable because l3101 driver is not available on site ..so we can not add in any mail account ..,2
"Printer is Good or can say Ok. But service is extremely Poor. i tried to return the printer within 10 days, Firstly amazon call centre guy misguided showing return policy and said it can not be returned. I ended up using this product finally.",1
If you print daily a number of papers then it is for you. It is very easy to use as well as refill. The cheapest printing cost. Good quality of photo printing and normal color-black & white print.,5
Total value for money. Has wonďerful print quality....very happy with this purchase,5
Been using 4 months and no issue except the PDF allignment are not accurate after printing.. may be I did not get correct settings.,4
Product n print quality is good. But I'm upset with the tech support of Epson company. They should atleast contact the customer after delivery. Or they should provide a proper working contact number. So that we can install the printer easily.,4
"As written in many comments, it supports borderless printing. but it can not support borderless printing on A4 size. It takes margin on A4.
Yes, it can print borderless on postcard size that is totally useless.",5
Print Quality is nice... its fast and easy to install. Overall a good buy for home usage. I bought for kids assignments. Scan quality is good. Only cons - it doesn't auto retract for double side printing.,5
"Using in my office as well as at home.
Totally satisfied with the printer. Impressive print quality with phenomenal photo print with glossy paper.
Wifi photo print is worked like charm.",5
Stopped functioning after few months. Bad color printing. Not worth the price. After sales support service not up to the mark.,1
"Was worried for ink drying, but thankfully no problems at all. Purpose solved !

Plus with Wi-Fi option, printing made so easy :-)",5
"One of the worst all in one printer by Epson.
Started problem with in 1000 copies. Making noise of gears. Raised complaint and technician solved the problem. But again after 100 print gear wheel sound problem started.
Page yield also very less.
Very disappointed by this product.",1
It is little bit irritating if you want it to connect with wifi and also the printing speed is not that much good which they have described.Apart from this the ink absorption (very High) is also not as per their promise.,4
"When I receive my parcel from Amazon facilitate person, I just open it and show that printer is pre-inked in Inkboxes.
So beware about the discoun, they will send you used product in the name of new.",1
"i bought this printer and working since 6 months , printer is not working.
It is not delivering print, photocopy also not doing scanning. continuously showing red light indicator and asking for refill inktank while inktank is half filled already.
No action performing . Also no support is provided by epson company.",2
"I ve been dealing with IT Components since 15 years. I personally feel EPSON is better than other companies, in terms of Price, quality, and ink charges. Go for EPSON...",5
"Very good satisfactory print quality installation is very easy and easy to use.
Value for money product.",5
"AS I HAD RECEIVED IT ON 16TH JULY 2019, THE BUILD QULAITY IS OF FIBRE AND SO STRONG , BUT PRINTING QUALITY IS VERY GOOD, CONNECTIVITY OF WIFI IS GOOD, BUT THIS IS INITIAL REVIEW FOR DETAIL REVIEW I HAVE TO USE IT FOR A MONTH .
IF TOUCH PANEL HAS BEEN INSTALLED IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD OR LCD SCREEN",4
This printer is good for home and small business. Print quality is good and printing speed is also not bad. The black ink bottle costs around 278 on amazon and gets up to 3000 prints which definitely saves money for regular printing.,5
As my laptop was not having cd drive i download software online I called 100times to given toll free number for installation and demo but no response,3
Never buy any of Epson Product. They cheat people on the name of warranty & after sale service. They are interested only in selling their product. Never expect anything from them. They forget their customers once purchase is done & payment is made. They are good for nothing.,1
"Hi, I feel sorry i bought such a lousy product. I had to chase them every day for installation request and was done after 1 week. next day printer stopped working. Inspite of several calls no response to the complaint registered. I DO NOT SUGGEST to buy this product.",1
Solved my problem for colour print,5
"Best printer with wifi connection,and print very less cost, ink tank refilling is too easy and no spillage cartridge is awesome, scanning is ok but low resolution but copying is fast and best",5
"Got it for decent price. But the printer as a whole is not meeting our expectations. While the brand quoted that 1000 color copies can be printed, but in reality we could print around 200 copies and by then the colors would reach the bottom.",3
There is no reason to comment about this product until and unless i get a replaced printer as the new product delivered to me is not printing may be due to defective head of the printer,1
"I got damaged product, scanner glass is damaged, and customer service not supported, very poor quality and service of amazon",1
After using this printer for almost 4 months. I would say it's pretty slow. After every print it takes time for the next print. Sometimes it really sucks. There was warranty issue. By the time amazon resolve the issue the warranty got expired. Amazon was very in resolving warranty issue.,1
"Printer is very good for home and office use. But while printing on glossy paper, there are little impressions of drum on the paper. Don't know if its fault of my printer only or some other users also have same issue. Please let me know. Other functions of printer are working fine.",5
"Superb product and installation support.
Good image quality but colour speed is too slow. Might be highly priced for the features available in the product. Finally good purchase",5
"I'm looking for a printer which is affordable with high yield printing and quality. I went through so many products and reviews finally i fixed for this. It met my expectations with no doubt, installation is bit easy if you follow the user manual.",4
This is very good product. Easy to install and configure. The print quality is good. I am using it with WiFi directly through mobile and also connected it with wifi router.,5
"Followed all steps for installation and it said all Connections established and gave all details in GREEN indicating Healthy connection setup.. But does not print and gives a big, rolling sound and does not take the input paper and gets jammed...",1
Thanx amazon for this product .i had tried to lots of time to bought this but many time it shows out of stock .but when i checked it out its available i immediate bought it.we eagerly waited for this product and we got it thanx amazon,4
"Print quality is awesome 👍
Only thing is (even they mention in manual) after first time switching on, it will ""eat"" around 70% of black ink . The rest 30% can print more than 700 coipes of black. Very much affordable .
It's simply a beast. :)",5
"Seller has sent me a defective peice, probably a refurbished one, had to wait for 3 days to get the part replaced, customer service not up to the mark.

Printing for both normal and photo papers have been excellent.",3
Great value for money...installatuon calls for an experienced user..great prints....horribly slow scans....,5
"Very economic. Quite easy to install. Registration is necessary & quite easy. It ensures regular software upgrades.
Prints, scans effortlessly from EPSON iPrint app
Print quality is excellent.",5
First one printer was Print blank pages when installation time by service technician Epson. Replaced by Amazon. New one installed by Epson service technician owsome product very high print quality you can go with this product no doubt only one thing time of product arriving please informed the Epson service for free installation,5
I have received damaged product i am trying to replace it. But Amazon is not accepting my request i tried to call customer care but call is not connecting.,1
We bought the printer for home use. So far we have taken more than 500 pages' print. It's going good. It's a good printer for home use.,5
Printer was very easy to setup though it takes more than an hour to go through the steps. Print quality is very good even on regular paper. Wireless printing works really well.,5
First received the printer. This had some isssues. Informed Amazon. Replacement done WITHIN 2 days. AMAZING AMAZON SERVICE.,5
The seller has send a used printer and it is not even working!!!! All the ink tanks were slightly filled at different levels and none of the tapes were on the product but instead it was pasted on the top of the printer. Take back this printer...this is useless..,1
"Not buy this printer. This printer has lots of problem such as blank print, red light blinking. It will stop working after printing approx 20 pages.Consider only higher or lower model but not this model. Very cheap plastic is used to make this printer body. Printing speed is very slow.",1
good product. took some time to register which was because of the delay from EPSON india. now issue sorted out and unit registered,5
I have been using Epson products from last 8 years but This is the worst product I have ever come across. The printer stopped printing the very next day. Printer always shows an error incorrect pages or load paper.. worst product from Epson.,1
Prints good quality and ink lasts a long time also. We purchased this for our small business use and it works well for our needs.,5
"Honestly review, some people's are giving 1star rating and poor review they are anti-epson they are from other company printer. Just ignore him and listen to me this printer is amazing. Amazing printer amazing printer quality amazing printing speed and easy to installation 😊😊😊😊😊",5
Good Product. Does the job. Ideally you should use it every day else printer head gets clogged. Good for rough use. Service support is very prompt. Try to use on Windows 7 or 10. Has issues with XP. Mobile printing is good.,5
A very good printer the print quality is not as good as shown and need to install the app for wifi print,5
Excellent printers scanners quality ❣️😘 very low cost of printing cost of colour and black and white papers.,5
Black and white print is great.. But colour print is just good.. Not for professional photographers!,4
The printer does a greater job. Printing quality is good though installation (connecting to the WiFi) was bit of a deal at first but once connected the printer was very easy to use,4
"Don't Switch Off This Printer Directly From Power , First Put It Off By Its Power Bottom Then Cut The Main Power .
Otherwise It Show Error And It Difficult To Resolve.
Its a very useful printer which never break your trust .",5
"Like: ink tank printer.

Dislike: the product had a malfunctioning scanner on delivery.

The first time it was installed was a disappointment.

Quick service by Epson and got it repaired by them",3
"I use it for home for my child.
Delivery is as expected.
Setup and installation is flawless.
Just few click, here and there, and you're good to go.
Wireless printing and scanning is awsome. I didn't even connect it via USB. A good product to own.",5
"When you're in emergency and need a bunch of photocopies like imagine you need 15 photocopies, speed of the machine goes down gradually. When you're at 11th photocopy, job takes at least one min for each copy further. I used office printers before but this one is too slow. Rest everything is fine with this.",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Really disappointed. I was pretty excited about receiving this product but I have spent around 6-7 hours installing it. First, the wifi won't just connect. Then, the ink button won't work. The network status report gives awkward replies. Probably going to return.",1
Never buying epson again. The print quality is really bad. Bought this a month ago and we have gotten it serviced twice already. We barely get 200 decent prints after which it starts misaligning every line. Absolutely disgusted with this whole experience. The customer support is useless to say the least.,1
"Very Bad experience, I knew EPSON has number one rank in rank printer but experience is quite different after 30 page black and white print got faded even color print on same page clear ,printing of picture is horrible lots of bar emage showing
I am not satisfied even spend Rs 13000",1
"I had been using....rather using suffering from the printer...in the span of 1 year I almost raised complaints 5 times of which last one was rejected saying out of warrany....
The printer for every 3 months end up in problem...in print quality....avoid this",1
The print quality is very bad.,2
"I'm rating this product after 8 months of personal use. Its still fantastic. I suggest must print a colour paper weekly to avoid nozzle jam.
Fortunately I never faced any such issue even if printer remained shutdown for half a month.",5
Pls don't buy this product... Lots of issues like.... Ink leakage.... No colour print.... Plastic body.... And worst part is no return or replacement by Amazon.... Its a useless product.... Go for other branded ....waste of money,2
"E- Easy to Use
P- Print awsum
S- Simple to handle
O- Operate Fantastically
N- Nothing like this
and like to add-on to it
Worth of money...",5
"Print quality is ok but black ink only comes with 1424 pages see my picture attached
My point of view Epson printer is not good compare to HP PRINTER,
Epson printer description showing 4500 pages but that is not correct ink tank 65 ml ink only come for 1500 pages",2
"SETUP PROCESS IS REALLY HARD & FRUSTRATING.
QUALITY IS GOOD.
PRINT QUALITY IS GREAT.
COLOUR FILLING IS EASY AND NOT MESSY.
GREAT FOR HOME USE",4
I didn't find the exact L3101 drivers for the printer in Google so I can't scan any documents to computer but I can print.So far print quality is good!!!,5
"Printing is taking much time and slow... But printer is very nice giving high quality prints........... Printing operation stops in between , when we give more number of pages------- So, better to set of range of pages------- and print",5
Don't buy this after sales service worst even after 10 days nobody turn for installation. Recommend not buy this product. It would white elephant and u have to only dispose as e-waste.,1
"Arrived in perfect condition. Very easy to install and simple to operate. Print quality of multi colour as well as grey scale are good.
The body is a bit delicate. Should use with care. Good for domestic and office use",5
"The printer is easy to install. Works like charm. Best part is the printing speed best in class.

The build is plastic and does not give confidence.",4
"Print kwality ok Type.. good for home use..
Envelope printing not ok (below average)
Photo print average
A4 paper print good",5
"After setup it print Blank Pages, called Epson customer care, they called after one day, said need to open the printer to repair...I brought this consider low cost. But it's very poor printer. Build is very poor.",1
Good product. Easy to install and use. Had issues with print output couple of times. Few outputs had colour dots. I am not sure if it was due to maintenance. Overall I am happy with the product and no complaints.,4
"If you can do all the trouble shooting by yourself then you can go for it
Don't expect any support from technical team.
Don't keep this as a primary printer,If you are using this printer for office and all make sure that thave a backup printer",2
"After much research, bought this printer. Does the job, prints documents really well.
Photo prints are good too.",5
"Built quality is not as expected, plastics are flimsy. Color Print quality is average
Price is good-Value for money",5
Very useful printer. Clear photos and colour prints. Very easy to installation. Wireless printer working fine,5
After trying long the installation tech could be contacted beforelong I myself installed the printer with the help of google. Printer quality is not good. Printer vibrates more than its speed.,3
Print quality in black ink is good but in color it is average..paper gets stuck on and off..However good performance for home and student use. Ink goes on for good number of prints and hence low recurring cost..More than Average returns on investment,3
"Ink is low during installation
All tank os half on first day...
Please give proper ink .

I complaint this to epson but did not solution",3
"Very easy to install, less weight product, for small and medium house or offices its much recommended.",4
"Yes it was very good product. Easy to use. Very easy to connect with Wi-Fi. We print through mobile phone. The ink is very well. Everything is Fine. But when I'm trying to print back side , the first page letters is reflecting in the back side page. Otherwise very good product. Print quality is So nice.",5
Wonderful experience so far. Regarding how many pages it can print in one refill has to be seen. So far good as expected from Epson,5
Great in performance and printing quality is good but it works sometimes slow in constant good electricity power supply. It is valued for money in its segments. For business purposes it may be purchased. Amazon delivery is also so fast. Thanks Amazon India.,5
Worth every penny. Within month we have removed more than 5000+ copies. Best in class color print quality also very good. Go for it......,5
"Print quality is poor,crumples the page most or the time,no back to back printing option,ink gets dry too fast,I think it will only 150-200 pages.my other budget inkjet printer is performing better than this one,absolute waste of money.",1
"I could not connect this printer to WIFI. Had to call Epson tech.support for the same. After they install I could print from WIFI. This printer doesn't support Apple iPrint. To print from iPhone you need to install ""Epson iPrint"" app.",4
Slow printing. Fit for home use only. Printer is not so good. It could be because it is for economical or home use.,4
"Negatives about this product
- Third Grade Print Quality
- Third Grade Customer Service of Epson India",1
Too hard to setup. USB cable connection is not compatible with the printer even though when they have clearly mentioned usb connection is present. WiFi set is easy but very time consuming as the printer is unable to make a successful connection.,1
"You won't believe the sheer number of times that this printer has got jammed. It caused me a lot of headaches. I do not recommend this product. VERY BAD JOB, EPSON!!",1
"Dear Sir / ma'am,

Good product..itzz my first time using an ink tank printer.So it took few minutes to figure out how to use it.But ink stays for long time n itzz worth investing in it.One complaint I have is...colour printing is taking little more time than usual.,4
Installation support was worst. Print quality is fine.,1
Very good printer... But I have a doubt to quantity of printing pages with full tank ink as promised company...,3
"Nice printer in this range and ink refilling system is awesome, no any leakage and no any trouble found when refilling. Printer is very handy, and good quality of printing. Fast speed to print colour and black white printing.",5
"Poorest quality of print ...

The customer service no does not work .

Please avoid buying this stuff it's just waste of money",1
"All lights blinking, and when I logged a case with Epson they said 3 days to revert on my ticket, this is dead piece of hardware!!!",1
Colour print quality is not up to the mark. Colour was not as bright as it should be. Don't waste money in buying this printer bcoz photo quality is very very poor. It's very dull.,2
"Using after one month printer totally disappointed me printout timing very slowly, head problem , paper jam problem, connecting problem totally waste my money",1
"I m not able to get even a single print, copy or scan. Every time it sounds much and display message that ink tank charge not completed, see ""start here"" but no such menus was found anywhere. Hardware is also weak. I do not recommend this.",1
"Worst product
Wast of money
I bought it before 10 days n not satisfied with this product
Paper jam issue again n again
Much slower than other printer
A5 paper not supported alwys jam and not worthy product
Suggest to not buy this",1
"Good printer for home use.
I faced one challenge, after setting up the printer I didn't use it for a week and black print head was dried up.
You have to ensure you take atleast one print per week.",4
Simply awesome printer...print quality excellent..only drawback is that you keep printing at least one page every other day and then only print quality will come. Baring this I think good investment to make.,4
Printer was good & grayscale printing super but coloured print is too slow. Otherwise better quality coloured print. Scan & wifi settings ok but there is no proper user manual. &front panel setting little difficult.,5
It is ok for home use but gets heated up fast and makes noise after printing more than 20 pages and when printing large number of pages but is ok for home use. Print quality is also very good but gets older with time. Many a times it shows error.,4
"I am reviewing it after using it for 5 days.
Pros: fast with usb, fast with wifi, even if you can connect it with your phone using otg cable. Print quality is awesome both colour and monochrome.

Cons: installation takes time. Build quality doesn't feel so good so handle it with care.",5
"In case you find problems installing the device, just install the driver software first. It will guide you what to do step by step.
What I like in this product is its economic printing and remote/wireless printing. The mess of using USB wire is eliminated.",5
"Received a defective product. The scanner was defective and all lights were blinking. The seller refused to take the return. Also, Amazon does not pick up the defective for replacement. We need to courier the product to the supplier somewhere in India.",1
"Just go for this without giving a second thought. Its best !!
It can print both BW and Color, Printing quality is Great. Can print 11-12 papers BW/Min, and 7-8 papers Colored/Min. Easy to handle and operate, having service centers in all major cities.",5
Very easy to install. Easy to handle. And awesome product to use as printer...,5
"Very cheap quality. Very light waight and poor performance.i was already use epson l380.last three year.it was very good work.
But again i want purchased a printer. I am purchase l3151 why? I already use l380.
My my decision is wrong. Canon is good option. अब क्या कर सकता हूं मैं फस गया",1
Easy to use,4
Good product and value for money. Installation is easy as per instructions.,5
"After 6 month of use I can say that this printer is made of very poor quality.
Not suggested to buy.",1
The Printer did not install properly though the instructions as shown in the CD were followed meticulously. Had to return the printer for fault. Waiting for replacement. EPSON complaints page won't register the complaint. Toll free number no answer citing covid 19.,1
"Printing is very slow. Only 6 ppm in black less than 1 ppm in colour printing . Not easy to use because if paper is jaming in printer ,without engineer paper is not extracted from printer. It is a continuous process of paper jaming in this model.This problem was by me after 3 days of installation.",2
Bought the product in Jan 2020. Printed 2000 odd Black and White pages. Excellent product so far. Good value for money.,5
Over all good product.I personally installed and configured. Instillation could have simpler for wireless printing . Its complicated.,4
"Wifi configuration is very difficult, please go with the printer which has display",3
What a fast printer with quality printing. Totally worth it. Plastic seems little bit cheap but it's ok. Giving reviewing after 6 7 month. No issue at all. Printing cost is very low. Running with same bottle provided with pack .,5
Product is good. In time delivery.working good till now.3 months limited use only. plastic chosen by the manufacturer for product designing could have been a better one.overall nice product.Able to connect wifi easily. Android application Epson Iprint is very useful. No display on the printer.,4
"Missing the content while printing, and now not even printing at all...only partial colored print, no black ink getting printed. This seems to be useless now. Would have to waste my time in getting this corrected. Much Below expectation!!",1
Print quality ok ....colour print not ok .....and printer quality i mean machine is thirdclas its all parts is very dangerous tray and paper coming place are very sensative......it is not ok far rural area ....tolaly this is not worth far money.....,3
Worth for penny. one bottle ink is lasting up to 4000 pages black and white.,5
The product is working alright till today however it's too early to comment,4
Very good for small office usage. Installation is easy if we follow the recommendations. Print quality is also good. Cons. Ink is draining out fast and don’t believe the company saying,5
"No one comes to install it and for service
Plz do not buy this epson product
Colour print so dull
N quantity of print is half than it show in discription",1
"Print quality is good.
Packaging was bas they didn't seal the product with Amazon cover .
They delivered directly as in the pictures i
uploaded. And there is no bill in the package.",5
"I think this is the best printer ever
Without thinking go for it
More information on my yt channel -iArsshWadhwa",5
"Wifi feature is quite helpful. Print quality is good for Normal printouts and Photocopy.
Not able to print photos or images on photo quality paper (disappointing). Do not go for this printer if you want to print photos from it.",4
"printer is good but sometime error due to technical reason paper came slowly from printer . colour and b/w print speed is good.
some features of printer software is amazing. good quality of printing & best results of every time.
thanks for service.",4
Worst buy. Complain was registered 10 days back however no one came till now. Product is under warranty.,1
"It doesn’t print. May be some technical problems persist. But Epson technical support is very poor. Nobody is attending to my call.
Amazon, please resolve my issue with Epson l3152 printer.",1
Defective product deliverd 🙁 tank leakage problem.. i used sublimation ink so they said it wont cover in warrenty😓 very disappoinment,1
"Very bad experience, despite multiple complaints and visits printer is not working. And technical staff says he is not able to understand and that too in warranty period. Toll free number is very difficult to access. So no more Epson after that.",2
Performance as expected. Easy to install and prompt service. Print quality is very good. Good printer for home and small offices.,5
Easy to install. Bought it during covid wave 2. There was some software update issue on the first day itself but that too got sorted through service centre. Very useful device.,5
"Print quality for color as well as black n white are good, app is eary to use.
As many time I do back to back print and the software does not have option to print odd or even page. So it will be very much time consuming to print each page 1 by 1.
Overall it's good product.",4
I had received damage product. Scan and copy did not work. All lights are blinking. I had called Epson service center they were immediately respond and rectify problem..,1
Overall it's a very good product. Easy to install and print quality is very good. Pretty impressed with print speed.,5
"Good to buy for this price point. Should not expect more. Every Inkjet printer is prone to regular maintenance and care. So, you must do it for good results.",5
"Good printer, print speed is good, only thing that I found missing is the wifi connectivity. I have to transfer files or email them to the desktop where there printer is connected to take printouts!",4
Nice product. Easy to use. Good quality. Convenient. Value for money purchase.,4
At times disconnects nd connects again on wifi but minor glitch fixes itself,5
A very nice product. Very useful in printing docs in office/ home. Print quality is good & very easy to operate,4
"The seller has sent 2019 manufactured product in June 2020 .
Their is a need for sellers to mention date of manufacture before the buyer places order",4
The scanner hasn't been working right from the beginning though the necessary software for scan(Epson Scan 2) is installed.,1
"easy to install.
print quality 8/10.
printing speed is good.
smart ink technology.
scan quality is good.

⭐⭐⭐⭐4 star.",4
Excellent printer 7500 colour pages and black 6500 pages maintenance is costly but printer is excellent,5
THIS IS ALMOST SIMILA TO MY PREVIOUS ONE MODEL L 360. NOT YET INSTALLED.,5
"Its good to daily use or day by day usage no problem at all at present and print quality is also well (black & white) still i am not tested on photo paper for photos, but its an average printing of general colour printing on A4 paper.",4
I installed it myself. Works well with my MAC & Windows systems. Colour prints look fine and look nice in glossy photo paper.,5
"Product is not good
Slowly worked so many wrinkles ¬ print properly
R u take back

Kkkamakshi Advocate 8328388935",1
It was a great product I used it for printing photos and taking colour prints. Expecting to last the ink as mentioned.,5

Takes less space.
Serves well.
Basic printing needs fulfilled.
U only need one for all print tasks.

"It is very easy to use
Best print quality
And value for money because of in just 9999 you will get three features like print,scan and copy.",5
"Good but slow first print, head cleaning required frequently.",5
As not as print standard per page cost as shown in advertisement.,4
"Since we buy the product it has a problem is printing on glossary papers, bad ink representation and giving technical errors and paper jab so freqenty. Very bad experience.",1
I DISLIKED IT AS IT IS NOT EASY TO INSTALL AND AS ON DATE IT COULD NOT BE INSTALLED AND COMMISSIONED. IT SEEMS AMAZON SOLE PURPOSE IS TO EARN THE MONEY AND NOT TO PROVIDE THE AFTER SALE SERVICE. NO ONE SERVICE ENGINEER TURNED UP FOR INSTALLATION.,1
"Other than no automated side-printing, It pulls paper very fast and roughly. It has tore the paper and stuck hundreds of times. Please don't buy it..",1
Very good product by Epson. I would always recommend to go for an Inktank printer since printing cost associated with them is quite low in comparison to any inktank printer. Its easy to install and low on maintainance. Go for it!!!!,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I bought this printer very fondly but its working is very bad. It has gone bad in just 4 days. Before this I have used Hp printers their result was not so bad as epson's very bad.,😭😭",1
"Good price, little noisy. Print quality is good. Prints with mobile app is fast compared to PC. First color print gets paper wet everytime. Overall happy so far after a month usage.",4
It's the Same 3150 Epson just change only label sticker as 3152 and all equipment and divers are 3150.,4
"I m not able to print a single page and when I reached customer service they replied saying I need to connect technical support in my area.

Printer is ok but prints was one black bottle is printing only 2000 prints in the site up to 7500 prints taking.so minimum prints and maximum prints number doesn't show,4
"This is the best printer in this price segment. Epson EcoTank L3101 all in one printer is best for home use.
But only thing is, a lot of maintainence is required.
Overall printer is best if u keep it properly",5
Print quality of epson 3152 is good and as expected though installation is little tricky. Have to consult youtube for same.,5
A printer with quality with budget. Worth for the money. Only one disadvantage is two sided print. You have to manually feed the paper for the back side print. Awesome in build service options. Nice product.,5
Scanner and copier always shows the line. No tech support available for Epson. Cannot return it as well. Very pissed with situation.,1
Print quality not what Epson claims. Very low standard,2
nice printer for small business and daily requirements domestic and office. after a long time started printing old memories into hard copy photo.,5

You should cover it if you are using it in dry and dusty conditions
I installed it myself however the technician help me through live phone call due to pandemic
.",5
Not even a week of use and I already see the black ink getting leaked on my prints. Waited a long time to get this printer but very disappointed with the usage. Returning the printer.,2
This proved to be a nice printer and the WiFi option is really easy to use. However after not using the printer for sometime I am noticing black clumps on the printed pages even after cleaning the head.,4
"The product is great , print qualtiy is awsem .
Wifi direct helps you print directly from your phone . Ink is easily available. Wifi direct take few seconds to start else its an amazing product . Go for it.",5

Good product within 10000. Regular print job required otherwise printer head jams. A scratch line comes in between the prints from the very first day. Rest is okay.,5
"Printer is not working properly. Getting break down very frequently. Despite showing the ink storeage, it doesn't come with proper print.",1
"Very happy to have this, on standard print setting we can have upto 3500 pages of printing. Greatvto use this. Need to improve the android app, it's not able to get the settings as in laptop.

"Don't buy it from Amazon, the fraud master... They have sent a duplicate product. Earlier it was working from my mobile, but as soon as the return date expired, it began problem.",2
"Working on iOS, Andriod, iMac. Colour print only takes time to get.",5
"Using since 1 month and faced 3 times wireless printing issue. Technicians simply checking and going, but still not resolved issue. Guys, i suggest you go for USB model instead of Wifi.",1
Awesome product that I ever seen its print quality is too better even on photo quality paper.,5
"Other than printing speed every thing looks good.
Connectivity could have been better",4
"Had contacted amazon regarding the item in which scanner is not at all worked from the day of purchase, amazon failed to help with this, such a bad customer service and bad quality item",1
Perfect for any task. I use it more often for photocopy. Performs well in even heavy usage also if you can compromise with printing speed. True value for money and worth buying.,5
"Dies what it is designed for, basically a printer for homes",5

"Appears to be used product
The ink bottles have already been emptied into the tanks .
No installation CD . Don’t know if it’s supposed to be there. I want a brand new product.",1
Product is good but bajaj finance not give proper response and first time Debit 1593 on 03/04/2020 and after all months Debit 1807 from my account so why change debit amount every time and give me resion for same,5
Highly recommended for small business and for home use.,4

The header of the product is damaged and since the product is useless. Don't trust the seller",1
Was having normal expectations from this product but it failed miserably. Could not take a normal print on installation. The Toll Free No. for Technical support was unable to support. Very negative experience from EPSON.,1
"Delivery wise good. Printer quality and user friendly interface. But one of the fault is scanning pannel alignment is wrong, if you copy any of document like A4 size , output print copy is cut on edge of the document. Otherwise is good.",4
"Ease of printing using WiFi

Mobile app is too good.",5

However, printer ink evaporates if not used regularlly. Good for only people who take more prints per day",3
It's a little complicated to operate as they are too many functions.,5
Body of the printer is made of very lite plastic. So cannot predict the durability of the body parts. Today it has fell down and got damaged 💔,2

"I purchased this L4150 Epson Inktank printer from Amazon in May, 2018 for Rs.15,700/-
The main purpose is for my pre-school kid's art and craft work ─ Say download farm animals pictures from internet, print them, cut them into shapes and paste them on a chart.
_____________
Salient features
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
♦ This L4150 is latest and upgraded version of L485 model, which is bestseller and Amazon's choice. L485 is officially discontinued by Epson. So, purchased this instead of L485.
♦ All the features and highlights of L485 exist in this L4150 too, even more.
♦ The best improvement in this series of printers (L4150,L4160) is that the ink tank compartment doesn't stand separately on the side. It is inbuilt within the dimensions of the main printer unit, making it look compact and beautiful.
♦ The ink-filling method is improved in this version compared to older ones - non-clumsy and easy.
♦ Epson claims 7500 B&W prints and 6000 Color prints with the ink given with printer. And it seems true based on reviews for the earlier model.
♦ The official ink refill for this model from Epson website is Rs.899/- for B&W and Rs.409/- for each color (C,M,Y) as in May, 2018. [Model Number = 001]
♦ Both Wifi & Wifi direct are present. So need to use any USB cable to connect to laptop for printing. Once Wifi is setup at the beginning, it's hassle-free to use.
♦ Printing from Android mobile is very easy. Install 'Epson iPrint' app and it shows status of printer etc., Also, install 'Epson Print enabler' app in your mobile and you can issue print directly from Google photos or gallery or file manager.
♦ Google Cloud Print and Epson connect are supported ─ You can issue print from anywhere as long as both your phone/pc and printer are both connected to internet.
♦ Scanning is very easy and I found it of very good quality.
♦ I did a photo print on a photo gloss paper and it's rendered with extremely good quality, as if it's printed in studio. I even framed the photo and hung it on the wall.

___________
Setup tips
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
• First fill in the ink, then only connect the printer to USB or power. Every other step is clearly mentioned in the Installation guide, just follow the steps. Don't take any action on your own.
• No need to use the CD given. Just go to epson website mentioned in the guide and download the Windows software. I would recommend this as generally, the one available on the internet will be the latest version of software with many bugs fixed.
• Use the USB cable to setup Wifi on the printer. It would be very fast & efficient compared to setting up using Wifi search option.

The only negative I found is that MRP is 15,499/-, which is mentioned on the Box and also Epson's official site sells for that price. Amazon seller is selling for Rs.15,700/-. I just didn't mind the extra 200 because I trust more in Amazon prime and purchasing in Epson's site would take 8-10 days for delivery.

I would definitely recommend this printer!
And for the guys out there in dilemma between L485 & L4150 ─ definitely go for L4150 !",5

"Pros: Print speed, print quality (including color), Connectivity (Wi-fi; Wired, Android app), Scanner

Cons: Two-sided print not available

Overall, a good printer. It'd be 5-Star if it had option of both side printing.",4
"This is the new model of the best selling ink tank printer in the market - Epson l 380 , Its very sleek and amazing . The printing speed and ouput is also better compared to previous models. All in all a great value for money product from Epson again!!",5
Nice and Smooth working,5
"The box was delivered in damaged condition. The upper part was soaked in water. Please order this printer from epson website, it's cheaper there. The printer is performing well.",3
Awesome printer ...Quality of printing is unmatched ..It generates true and natural colour shades ...Wifi feature making it so easy and convenient to use ..I just love this printer,5
"Let's be fair to Epson. They are getting us this printer cheaper than anyone else. The print quality and the ink cost of Epson printers is incomparably low. You should buy this printer knowing well that its lifespan is one year. I bought L1800 in October 2018 for my small office. And everything in the machine broke down in two years. I had to change the motherboard and the printhead just after its one year warranty ended. The Epson service guy has been in my office at least a dozen times in the last two years. I would suggest that if you buy this printer or any other cheap Epson printers you should get two of them so that there is one stand-by machine. The printer will give you problems every week, so your work will not be stalled if you have two machines. This week I have been told that the main board (again, within two months of replacement) and the motor will have to be replaced because the printer stops after 5-6 pages of continuous printing. It's a flimsy machine, be aware of that. It's made in Indonesia and not China. I, on the whole, have spent Rs24,000 already for its upkeep in the last two years. The cost of L1800 in India is Rs33,000. So should you really service it and replace its broken parts after the warranty ends. I would say no. Just buy a new machine when it breaks down after the warranty period. I am not angry with Epson because the print quality is superlative and the cost of running (if you don't take into account the spare parts and servicing) is incredibly low. Guess, for small businesses it is still worth it.",1
A Goodnight print quality but not for photo prints it worth for normal printing and best in this price segment,5
"I brought this printer to print occasionally for my child's school work. However after few days when I gave a print, the pages came blank. Logged a service request and was attended by an Epson professional. Apparently since I had not printed for around 10 days, the ink went back into the tanks from the print heads and created a vacuum because of which it was printing empty pages. The issue has come in again now inspite of printing every 3-4days. Totally frustrated with this printer and would recommend only if you will print every 3 days atleast",2
Can you imagine to shell out huge money and get a printer that doesn't print back to back automatically? Why would anyone manufacture a printer without a duplex printing option and price tag so much? We tried manually printing back to back with 20 pages and it printed everything in the wrong pages. This printer wastes your pages and money as well. Do not buy this product. I would request Epson to stop manufacturing this product in the interest of public usage.,1
"real life printing cost is around 25-30 paise for black and white and not 7 or 10 paise. this excludes the paper cost.
per ink bottle of black (genuine) of 500 rs will print upto 2000 pages.
have finished 1/4 of the ink and printed around 500 pages.

their estimates are for draft prints and more often than not the draft prints are quite light.",3
"There is no tecnical support and epson helpline people just keep taking complain but no action is taken I regret buying epson I used for 1 yr now when i changed my wifi server the setting changed and epson staff is not helping me rectify it since a month ,when u go out of warrenty they dont entertain you sad .they think i dont have some money to pay homevisit when I could afford to buy epson .they called me exactly when vodaphone had all india server issue and rejected my complain 2 times",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 This is a really good printer.
Using it since 15 days .

Pros -
1- The print quality of photos on Glossy paper is amazing. And the Black and White print on normal paper is also great.
2- I have printed roughly around 10 glossy prints on Glossy paper and 40-50 black and white normal paper and 5-6 Colored prints on Normal paper. And the ink has dropped only a tiny bit. So I think it's really pocket friendly printing .
3- The wifi printing works fine.

Cons -
1- The color Print on Normal paper feels a lil washed off . but It's workable.
2- The first time setup is quite confusing .

Other than that check out the photos and video and if you have any other query Dm me on my Instagram - @pranjal_mikaelson",4
"The main thing about it you cannot print more than 1 at a time and if you have to print more than 1 copy you have to press as number that you have to print.
Baki sab thik hai.
Print karne ke baad pani se haath nhi lagaye nhi to thoda smudge ho jayega.
Photo bhi waisa hi hai
Print quality acha hai
But wahi pani ke saath thoda smudge aane lagta hai.
Thoda sa bhi pani rokh nhi pata.
L3110 aur l3150 aur l4150 teeno same hi hai.
L4150 me wifi +duplex printing+black ink tank bada hai extra hai , to wahi l3150 me wifi extra hai , l3150 se.
From my view for primting purpose of single use you may prefer l3150 but ek hi copy baar baar karna hai to epson ka hi screen wala lein, photi printing ke liye only photo printer le aise, sabhi kaam karega but not to the perfect use. Baki sab aacha hai.

Thank you

"Beaware of post warranty Trouble with Epson -
I have an Epson L355 Ink tank printer which is out of warranty now, and requires print head replacement.

When I raised a request for service, the request was forwared to a authorized 3rd party service who claimed the new print head will cost Rs 4900, but it will NOT HAVE ANY WARRANTY SUPPORT.

Basically it means, if you get your ink talk print head clogged and require print head replacement, either you need to purchase a new print head without any warranty, or throw it away and purchase a new one.

Make sure you talk to Epson sales support about it before you spend Rs 10,000 on Epson Ink tank printers.

Hope it helps.",1
"Complete wastage of money as well as time to use this product. Fun making service as they can change each and every part but can not replace the product so to honour the customer. They replaced head of my printer 5 times still issue was there and no limit to other parts. At the end they replaced all the parts with other printer they were having at the service centre but again of no benefit or relief to customer as still the issue of printing was there like a ghost to EPSON.
They say warranty is to replace every part but no replacement as per the company.",1
"I used Epson L210 before and it printed on regular photo paper (175 gsm). The new L3110 I bought does not even recognise the 175 gsm paper. Says empty tray. The one time it tried to print on it almost damaged the print head.

WORKAROUND!!!!

I bought Bambalio BPG 135-50 (Classic) 135 GSM Glossy Photo Paper in Amazon and it works like magic. It is thin photo paper, almost like regular A4 paper 80 gsm, who cares. It prints perfectly and is glossy like any other photo paper. Try it, problem solved :)

The printer now prints great again! Don't forget to print at least 1 sheet every 2 days. I do 2 sheets every 2 days.",4
Very good Printer. Easy to use. Easy to connect with mobile or computer. Good scan resolution. Very good Printer for this price range,5
"It is the worst printer. I purchase it January 21 and after that I call for service for 5 times only for single problem.
Its blinking issue really a stupid issue that i seen in it.
I asked service personnel to tell me how I can solve it because it happen again n again but never told me.
This issue is coming because of wrong specifications company provide.
This printer showing scan on 1200 Dpi but it stop working just after 500 to 600 dpi.

So please guys if you thinking to by this machine. Don't do it.",1
"One of the good ink tank printer with wireless technology, I have bought it in nearer shop ,little issue with installation so watch in YouTube and solved it, to get the Wi-Fi password ,turn on projector and press both Wi-Fi switch and next to it for 7 seconds, and wait for a seconds and you can see Wi-Fi led light steady ,then press only next button near to Wi-Fi button for again some seconds then release,before doing these please feed plain paper you will get prints that is with Wi-Fi password.",4
"I thought of buying a wifi for my office considering anyone could give print but i would highlight few important points.
1 not for office. The big thing I realized duplex printing. It doesn't print on both sides automatically. I had to find a trick but still that is not automatic.
2 a bit slower to print even black colour
3 from mobile u need to open their epson app and then if u want to print any document first u need to convert then into pdf as it only print PDF from mobile. So another disadvantage
4 wifi didn't connect to my broadband as it didn't have WPS. So everytime if i need to print on wifi, first i need to love to printer wifi and then give print.

So overall nothing that fancy.
Not worth this kuch amount.
Recommendations
Go for wired one and if for office then duplex is must otherwise u will keep on changing paper side day to print it manually on both sides.",3
"I have L360,my experience with local authorized service center in Patna is bad.My printer initially running good,once after paper Jam,both light started blinking.I was not knowing at that point of time that manually rotating inside roller at once will free up the jam and will solve the problem.When went to service Center,they told that ink pad to be replaced,and they replaced 2 original parts with old one and without doing just cleaned ad given the printer for which they charged more than 900/-.After 2nd visit not the printer is totally spoiled.....because of dishonesty of service Center guy....I decided not to ever buy Epson printer...I have a friend with whom also they have similarly cheated.They try to spoil the printer so that you have to buy new one.",1
Awesome printer...print quality is nice...no wifi connectivity problem remote printing works great...photo print is also good.... perfect for all uses....,5
"Epson changed the world of printing by its Ink Tank technology. No doubt its ONE of the most popular printer in every small shop. I frequently use this printer for huge volume printing. I think three color bottle combined can print around 2000 to 2500 pages max, may even less I think. And it can print only 5-10 color pages at max per minute. So, their claim of page output per ink bottle and page per minute is biggest TOTAL LIE almost like a fraud. Even then, you can definitely buy this printer. I also will buy 4160 model for its auto duplex feature.",4
"Very nice printer, installation was little bit tricky but once u read the instructions then it's easy.
Writing this review after 3 months of purchase and after approx 1500 print pages. Still ink level is at 75%, only 25% colour ink and 50% Black ink was used.
A very genuine product, easily connects with phone and WiFi. Can print directly from phone or computer or anywhere from world after internet connection with modem. Customer care service is also gud, representative comes to ur home if any problem.
Fully satisfied bcz its print cost is very low as compare to cartridges.",5
I have been using it since 11 months. Print quality is great. No problem at all except print output is only limited as ink level is presently at 10% and till now only 1429 black/white Pages printed. So it is much less as compared to mentioned output of 4500 BW pages.,3
Mac users will not be able to change print settings to print on photo paper or high quality. Issue with software. lot of complaints on net. Epson support not helping,1
Very easily installed amazing print quality I was using other brand ink tank printer but I didn't liked quality of print but it's quality is wow.,5
Worst product always working slow and printing quality very poor ... every time asking head clean ...vifi also very bad ....and most important wast ink tank future is very bad......i don't know why this future in this .and so many times asking restarter software .... this software is so costly and available in Amazon 😅 500 rupees software we buy and install that then start working printing...so i suggest you dont buy this printer.....last year i by this 12500 then now it's cost 13000 thousand above....my friend buy this 12000 thousand in local Shop what is real price we don't know so please don't buy this product.,1
"Worest of it's kind....before I used many printers from Epson series I am upset with it's performance. Regular complaints like paper jam (unable to remove Paper also) ,always we have to clean heads and nozzles, network issues....it's not flexible for regular users..... don't by this product....I am not interested to give reviews... even though I do this.",1
Print quality is ok. I have bought it from local shop. I believe it's my biggest mistake. I should've check the review. Worst product. after 1 year I have to take this printer to the service center in every week. And tech support is pathetic.,1
I purchased this printer and found it is not compatible with MAC 10.14. Technical team is totally incompetent and the solution they gave me is to reinstall Operating System. WOW !!! they cannot give me this solution ... Amazing ... My confidence in EPSON is now ZERO...I was better off with HP..,1
"Worst printer that I have ever had. Dont waste money to buy this one... It have memory problem also, very lazy printer in scanning, it even show problem in bond papers though in photopapers...",1
Epson printer worst once in a year you need to replace printer head which cost 1/3 of printer . For e.g. my printer l 405 13000 Rs cost and its head replacement cost 4500 Rs . Which is once in a year and has no warranty not even one day . And its capable to print only 750 black and 300 colour print . Company claim 7500 black or 6500 colour . And one major thing parts are not available in open market only in service centre . So they can charge what they want . And they given 2-3 service centre to same person if you have problem with that guy your product will not get repaired so you have to throw .,1
"Epson has once again come out with a revolutionary product offering in the ink tank segment. While there previous models l361 , 360 , 380 had captured the market , this is a highly improvement product with sleek design and ergonomics , making for reduced foot print . Also the quality of the product is good and is in line with Epson other range of printer, All in all , a hgh value for money product and a great upgrade from L 360 , 361 and 380",5
Don't buy it it's not good product. After 1 week is printer is defect and print any pages continues 3 pages after printing speed is very low Don't buy it. try another printer(sorry for the bad English),1
"this is the worst ever printer and the most pathetic customer service. will suggest never to buy any epson product. this printer has a lot of defects which are never addressed by epson. they just do cleaning and wait till the warranty period expire. every week i raise a complaint. they come open the printer, do cleaning and say that the printer is ok. next few days, same thing repeates",1
"One of the worst printer i have used. Though printing quality is good( if printer works properly, which rarely happens)... Printer makes lot of noise while printing..
Also.... I bought it 4 months back and since then.. have complaint around 4-5 times... Sometimes regarding cartridge issue...or paper jam issues.... And there is also no way to remove the jammed paper easily.... Once paper is jammed inside it...it keeps on soaking ink...and the white jammed A4 paper becomes fully black after soaking lot of ink till the time the company's engineer comes to rectify it in 1-2 days.

A big NO to this printer...",1
"I bought Canon G3000 initially. Later found in the description that Epson L3150 has 33 ppm speed with better dpi than the former. I thought it's a good bet with Rs 2000/- extra bucks. So ordered one for my brother. After receiving the product I was utterly disappointed. I doesn't even print 10 page per minute. I printed an invoice and found vertical lines were printed broken. I cleaned the header and printed again but it is of no use. The invoice was printed neatly by Canon G3000. So the claims it made in the specs are out right lies.

However I found that the color print is better than Canon G3000.",2
"This printer quality and speed is good...but its a bit over priced on amazon ..we can easily get this at 10500 at local shops including warranty and latest manufactured product...
Choice is yours...good luck :)",4
Not working. Ink spills each time I try to take print outs. Paper jams often evn though I arrange it properly. Have bn using printers for ages but this is crap. The company should be sued,1
"This printer works well initially but after 1 year of use it gives me so much headache. Paper gets jammed all the time and lines appear when printed in colour.
Don't buy this printer if you don't want headache.",2
"I really loved this product. Does a good job. I did the setup in 15 mins. Can now print easily using my mobile, iPad and computer. It's pretty convinient and affordable for a small business. Value for money!!!!!",5
"My brother bought this printer 23 days ago, now its not taking a4 size paper. My brother went to service center and then staff cleaned this printer and give back to my brother. When he come from service center exactly after 3-4 days same problem with this printer page still not loading. I think he should to forget about his money and also abou this Babasir.",1
slow printing speed dont buy it canon is other option .... . . . . . . . . .,3
"Very bad product of Epson No Quality and speed of print and head of this series l3115,3130,31.........is very bad need clean after 10 colours or 20b/w print please see o not buy this product and escape to lost your money
If company read this massage please do improve your product quality as l385

"I buy this product since September 22nd 2019 I loved it
Small problem coming out because I didn't used for past 3 months because of covid 19
The product is still under warranty so i tried calling customer care no use no one is attending the call i dont know what to do
Hence i I request u to help me out to fix the issue thank you",4
"Epson printer aee always have a good quality. I ordered this one as my friend suggested and also by reviews saw on Amazon. No doubt print is of good quality, I have printed photographs also and they are of good quality. I really liked this product. About tech support I will say on one called me after purchasing the product.",5
"Pros:
1. Easy to use
2. Economical
3. Quality of the print is decent

Cons:
1. To much paper jams in 70gsm. Only 80gsm papers works without any issues.
2. No LED screen for Rs.12500. so it’s difficult to understand if the printer has some error.

You can definitely go for this printer",4
"Print quality not good as compared with l380 I used previously. Photo paper gets jammed often during winter.
Don't purchase this product. Go for another one. Every time I have to push the paper to print my documents. L 380 was better than this donkey look like printer. No value for money.",1
"Been using since more than 1.5 years, fantastic product.

Pros:
High quality color printouts
Printing directly by phone app
1 button photocopy
Speed is good

Cons:
Fragile (as every printer is)",5
Just ok for home use....Not for office use ... It has so meny problems with its head ..... Required nozole cleaning regularly .... It has also peper jam problem....,3
"Dear friend please don't purchase printer through Amazon recently I have ordered HP 419 Cooler all in one ink tank with wifi but seller dispatched HP 319 cooler with wifi. I have registered complain in Amazon customer but they didn't taken any action. HP engineer was witness during the installation he is open box and product didn't match with invoice.
Amazon representative denied to replace the product.",1
"It's a user friendly product for moderate usage.
Fair enough for this price range.
Low printing cost with good quality",4
Printer is good. Print quality is also good. But it's delivery was so harrar able. I got frustrated with delivery.,4
"Extremely bad experience with this one! No support for Apple Devices, no airprint compatibility, worthless iprint app can never detect iphone, no compatibility with macOS.

Also the Ink dries up everytime, absolutely no functionality at all.

Horrible Experience!",1
"Compact design, easy to install and operate, wifi printing feature is very convenient. Great printer for home office & personal use",5
Printer is very slow for shops uses who use for photostate after 10-15pages printer getting slow it takes 40-50sec to print single page then also it needed head cleaning coz of lines on the print ....I think it's better if I go with brother or Canon ..,2
Guys i was very confuse about this product but i purchase it from local market in 11500.. I read some negative reviews about this product but seriously it's worth to buy.. It gives almost 1500 prints in sungle ink of 65ml use and it gives 8 print in 1 min.. Easy to use and work smoothly..,5
Print outs are very very slow.Difficult to get 1 copy of xerox in one minit.It was from the date of purchase.Though we have informed to the technician he simply said xerox copys are slow but print outs will come fast.SO I HAVE NO OPTION TO PURCHASE ANOTHER COMPANY IN WHICH WE WILL GET FAST.,2
"Worst ever printer i have ever tried in last 15 years. Worked only few weeks and belive me color print quality is worst after that. Print head automatically stopped working, printing...despite full cartridge it never print now....
Try Canon or HP always.....
Worst customer service....",1
"Wrost garbage
Too many times papaer jaam i am using this since march 20 i have registered complaint 8 time till now even after that as usual paper jaam",1
This printer gives good crisp prints and also saves on printing ink. The cons are the software takes hours to load from the net as well as the cd drive. The soft ware for direct wifi printing is not user friendly and they have made it quite complicated. I am writing this review after about a months use,4
Printer stopped working after using it for 3 weeks. Very rarely used it. Only 3btimes to print out flight details. What a waste of money,1

"I have been using this printer since last year, headache is it keeps going offline from wifi. I tried to set static IP instead of dynamic IP, still it doesn't help.

Called tech support in Hyderabad, those people don't even know anything and they couldn't understand the issue at all. Only suggestion they gave is to try to reinstall drivers from CD drive :), they are expecting these days all laptops to have cd drives.

Now , I am resetting wifi setting every few days to work with it.",2

"It is Compatible model and light weight too.. printing speed is also good. Easy installation, by wifi direct you can connect your smart phone n print. Resolution is great. Liked it. Must go for L3150. Happy and satisfied.",5
"This printer is best suited for home and small business use. The best part of the printer is its installation and connection with the home router. Run the CD that comes along with it and it will guide your through all the steps from filling the ink tank to connecting the printer to your home router and also connect your smart phone directly to the printer using Wifi Direct.
It's easy to use. Even a child can give a print command from a smart phone or pc connected to the home wifi router.
It gives real good quality monochrome and color prints. I printed all the family pictures on photo paper for the wall photo frames. You can also print borderless photos. Surprisingly, it used very less ink for the best quality prints.
You can also scan by giving command from Espon smart phone app. Also you can use your smart phone camera to scan and send it over to printer wirelessly using your home wifi router.
It's an exceptionally good printer for home and small business use.

Updates after my printer ran into some issue-
Recently, black ink stopped printing. I searched online for help and found a few videos that showed how to open the printer and clean the head. Believe me don't waste your time on such videos. I went to Epson support site and it suggested me to run a printer diagnostics. The Epson software is absolutely magnificent in detecting the issue and do all troubleshooting itself. You just need to follow the steps (just a few clicks on the Epson software on your laptop/mobile). It's damn easy. I fixed the issue on my own following the steps mentioned on the Epson support article. I had an awesome experience.
*******Update after 6 months' use********
Although it's very easy to clean the printer head using the Epson's Android app, it will require you to clean the printer head before giving the first print of the day. NB- I use this printer at home. I don't require to print daily or too frequently.",5
Good product,4
Super product,5
Nice product,4
"I purchased this printer a few months ago and have used it for several printouts till now. I had to b really thoughtful about its feedback , simply because buying printers online is quite a challenging decision especially the notorious reviews posted by many. At the end you trust your gut and make a decision. For most of the time people desire everything for the lowest price possible however please bear in mind quality demands research and money! So this is what i feel about the printer -
1. It looks great. Infact it looks pretty classy.
2. I love the print quality. It does so much justice for the image you want to print.
3. I paid 4890/- for the printer. The image print output is pretty satisfactory.
4. I printed a lot of sheets. Like, i totally went crazy with my print outs. I was working on a vision board project (more like a vision wall) and It required quite a bit of printouts. I hate going to the printer shops with the images I want to print as I have privacy issues. But so happy this printer did not even fuss once and facilitated smooth and steady printouts.
5. The installation was a cakewalk. It is compatible with my iPhone and Mac. Easy peasy. I love user friendly technology.
6. I have always inserted one sheet at a time. Why? because i find that arrangement quite hassle free and convenient.
7. A couple of times the paper got jammed. #commonprinterproblems. I did not feel that I should mind that. Given the convenience of home printing. Everything is better at home.
8. I took prints on regular sheets as well as glossy sheets. I would tell you this- , sheet type hardly made a difference. In future i'd use a regular sheet. Not a glossy one. I just tried glossy because may be I expected 'photo print quality'. While the print quality was great, the final print washed out the glossy effect. So it is redundant.
9. The printer uses the 803 ink cartridge and that is where the catch is.
10. 803 print cartridges clearly read that they are disposable and meant for single use only.
11. The original cartridge exhausted quite early. I am able to say this as I later ordered the refill ink and refilled my cartridge and I was able to get more prints this time. (It might be because with the original cartridge I printed glossy papers and they consume more ink. MAY BE. I'm just guessing.)
12. I watched a couple of Youtube videos and learnt how to refill the cartridge. I followed instructions and Viola! my printer started to shoot prints again.
13. Now , when you refill the original cartridge the printer's ink indicator does not read it. Which you'll learn to adapt because in moments your printer will be shooting pages after pages.
14. SO after several and many prints It was time to refill the cartridge. and Guess what...It did not work. I tried everything. The prints turned out horrible. The ink was spilling all over. Even inside the printer and that made me very sad. Nobody likes a tardy looking gadget!
15. My conclusion is that HP is right. 803 does not allow a refill. Even though the ink sellers claim and list that it does...It does not.
16. The first refill was may be a lucky shot. It worked. I was very happy. The second refill was a complete fiasco.
17. Eventually I discarded the cartridges.
18. I logged in to Amazon and wanted to place order for fresh cartridges and guess what. Out of all the HP models , 803 has the most expensive cartridge. That made me very thoughtful and cautious.
19. Unless HP does something about the price of the Ink cartridges, the ink will blot your enthusiasm.
My verdict - It is a great printer. I love it. Love the print quality. But 803 is an EXORBITANTLY PRICED ink cartridge. May be i'll try the refills again when my next cartridge arrives and update my review just in case i am successful beyond the first refill attempt. (UPDATE- the refill completely did not work with next new cartridge ran dry. Also I noticed that the new cartridge printed half the amount of papers from last time. Not sure of the decline)
I am not complaining because ultimately I have to take everything into consideration. But going to the printer shop is a BIG NO for me.

Review Update 7th March- I realized the cartridge purchased from Amazon I.e 803 for this printer is not compatible. My printer didn’t read the color cartridge. It was an old generation piece and the black ink cartridge leaked during printing. It basically suggests that the cartridges are either refilled or not genuine. I later purchased them from HP website. Even though expensive I was content about the fact that they are genuine and have same business day delivery. I love the Amazon returns policy. They accepted the opened cartridge and refunded quite promptly.

Review Update - Jan 24- it’s been six months the printer has been completely useless and I e been wondering what to do with it. Selling it on OLX seems like I’ll be cheating the buyer. I switched to a new ISP and the printer would not connect. I registered the call with HP CS . There was a lot of hassle. After spending around 72 hours back and forth they sent a technician. The printer just didn’t detect any connection with the phone, laptop and the WiFi. Technician refused to take any responsibility and said Ive been entering the password wrong. The technician and customer service people were so smart to place the blame because apparently the only device not connecting to the WiFi amongst the whole list of gadgets was the printer.
Final Review is that as excited I was , it fizzled out so bad, that it is ridiculous to even think of giving the machine away for free as I’ll lose face if someone asks for a demo! I thought I’ll bear with the super highly priced ink but for a printer that doesn’t sync or connect, it’s a waste! It’s like a marriage which you realize is going bad within 6 months of being married! The benefit with the printer being - you have the freedom to discard it!
Interestingly I also feel that the shelf life of this printer is meant to last only for one bundle of sheets you buy. The printer exhausts post that! If you’re looking for a heavy use...you must buy the really expensive ones! Yes. That’s true.
HP customer service experience is 0/10.",3
"Printer Is Good But My Experience It Is Not For Heavy Use If You Use It Heavy,Large Documents Print Than It Is Surely Loose Your Pocket For Buying Ink Cartridges!!!..It Is Only For Home And Occasional use..
I Am Buying It During Amazon Great India Sale Very Discounted Rate So It Is Awesome Deal For Me.Received New Hp Seal Pack.
Pros:-
1.Wi-Fi Range:-
Its Cover My 2Bedroom and Hall Successfully But Little Bit Take Time To Connect My Wi-fi Dongle(My Desktop)
2.Automatic Updates:-
Printer Is Automatic Update When It's Connect To My Wi-Fi Router
A Little Bit Difficult Process To Add To Printer On Wi-fi Router And My Desktop ..After Some Try I am Successfully Connected To Printer With My Wi-Fi Router.
Cartiges
Both cartiges is original color print is good if you print branded photo color paper but
I am not understand why my black color cartiges vaporize automaticaly and create light black spot on my new printer many places.
Anyways this printer is good for light use and home use like personal photo print,personal printout,importent document to scan etc.",5
"The cost per print is very high , I hardly went up to 40 pages and the black ink is already depleted ! , the connectivity is not an issue seamlessly connects with your devices , but the rate at which the ink depletes is very fast , this is suited for people who print once in a while and also when they need the print to be confidential which you don’t get in an internet centre. Strictly not for people who print a lot.",4
"I bought this product and returned it after 4 days.Coming straight to the pros and cons :
Pros :
1.Its quite affordable in a price range of 5000-5400 ,given the multi functionality (print,scan and copy)it performs true to its claim.
2.Its super light to carry around. Can be moved around easily if needed as it uses cartridge which is dry and does not form bubbles as in an ink tank printer.
4.Gives good prints both coloured and b&w.
5.You have the choice of purchasing either of the cartridges, depending upon your usage, b&w or coloured,in case of find it costly to buy both,and still it would function absolutely well.
6.Gets easily connected to a laptop by the USB.
CONS:
1.The most difficult part of this printer was connecting it with the mobile wifi or wifi direct as they call it in the absence of any physical technical support and one gets immensely hassled in this process,as they do not provide any demo or at home technician service to help you connect for the first time.It requires a whole lot of things like router,dual band wifi, and though they claim and try to enable an easy connectivity with wifi,which it isn't at all.After some time you almost give up on trying to connect with wifi and simply get your work done by directly connecting with laptop which it does good .
2.It is not mentioned anywhere on the Amazon app the cartridge that you get with this printer are only dummies meant for 20-25 prints ,and not the real ones.And so you need to buy them along with this printer if you have got to print at least 50 pages.
3.Though its inexpensive ,but its costly in the long term as it gives you only 100 bw pages per month with a newly bought cartridge which is way less than the ink tank printers.
So this printer is budget friendly,and a good deal for low usage like occasional homework and assignments of children,or ticket prints etc.",3
"very nice air-printer.. no need of wire connection.. i connect it to my wifi router (wireless) & use that printer with all devices (mobiles, laptop & computer) which connected to wifi...",5
"Never Buy this model for one reason :-original new cartridge gives hardly 20 color prints , even black color prints as well. Print quality is VERY GOOD and BRIGHT.manufacture manual says 165 color prints ,it's NOT true ,they need to change this statement.",1
"The printer is super cool. Obviously the printing cost is very high, no doubt. But at the same time you should know how to get around it. I refill the cartridges myself.. And to be more specific, I refill with the original ink bottles HP Gt 52, yeah.. The print quality is awesome. If you want to further reduce the cost, use the local ink bottles that you get at around Rs 100 for 100 ml bottle. That would be much cheaper. One bottle gives a print capacity of 1000 pages. One time refill would give a print capacity of 100 pages. So technically, the print cost is reduced to as low as 10 paise. I am still using the cartridges that came with the factory shipping and have already printed more than 500 pages consuming only 50 ml of ink..",5
Couldn't really pair using mobile but was able to pair with Mac using wifi Direct. Very limited instructions provided. Had to press a few buttons to print out instructions stored in the printer itself. So took some time to figure it out. Connection using usb was instantaneous. Works just fine. Cartridge was included and printer displays cartridge left. Happy with it for now.,5
"Very nice product. Wifi configuration took time, but results were amzing. printing directly from phone, makes life more easy. i was expecting this to be duplex printer, but didnt find that feature, need to explore more.
Recommended product for home purpose and small office purpose, Copy and scanning is easy through HP smart app on Mobile phone. Overall nice product",4
Does what’s it’s intended to do . Setting up the app took a while but now it’s smooth . Print quality is better in this price range . Haven’t used it much extensively but whatever I did was smooth.,5
"I have been using this printer for the past 3 months and I am writing this review now as I wanted to give the other customers a very genuine review on this product after using it.

First of all, this is not absolutely the best printer for daily use. The one and only reason for that is the ink price.
The HP 803 cartridge used in this product will always give you a headache while buying a new one. The cartridges set (Black n color) will cost around 1800 rupees which is quite high for an ordinary customer, and the cartridges last for only 200-300 page prints in normal quality. There is an option to refill the cartridges after it is exhausted but it won't work after 2-3 refills probably.

I used this product for my project printouts, study material printouts, making copies of documents, bills, etc in a regular basis

for the first time after the cartridge was empty, I was able to refill it using the ink bought from the Amazon.in site itself and was able to take another 150-200 printouts before it was empty again. The 600 rs ink bottles are enough for 10 refills. But on the second time after I refilled and started using, after few prints the cartridges were spilling out more ink and sometimes no ink at all which resulted in incomplete printouts and waste A4 sheets and i had to buy a new set of cartridges which was nearly 43% of the product cost

PROS

1. Excellent Working
2. Good Quality Printouts
3. Easy to use
3. Copy/Xerox Feature (Both color and B/W)
4. Wireless connectivity (Very easy printout using phones directly: Requires HP Plugin installed in your phone)
5. Good Hardware

CONS

1. Cartridge too costly",3
"Cartridge rate is higher except that all are nice. It is nice printer for home use and price is also affordable. If the price rate is adjusted than this is the best wireless printer. It can scan,print and we can do xerox in it.",4
"I don't know why the seller has listed this product as HP Deskjet 2622, even though what I received is 2600.
Anyways, for Rs. 3999/- it is not a bad product at all. Every feature is the same as mentioned in the description. The printer comes with 2 cartridges (color and black) that was very easy to install. The print and copy quality is perfect, and fast also.
I am happy with the product, apart from the fact that it is giving some problem in connecting with my phone. Once I was able to print directly from phone, and the next time, the phone showed the printer is unavailable.
OVERALL: Very good product for the price.",4
"This printer HP Deskjet 2729 is really amazing. It's printing quality of both color and black &white is very very clear and good.
I like printing quality of this printer.
Dislike about this printer is that it is pretty slow during wireless connectivity.
But I can say that just go for it...",5
"If you have no where to waste your money, this is the one. Most irritating product I have ever purchased on Amazon. The functionality of printer is hilarious and if you don't have patience, my advice, refrain from purchasing. The ink run at super fast like Jamaican Usain Bolt speed.
Note: Amazon you should publish my review or don't wala such product.",1
"The product is not recommended at all whether you use it for home or office.
best are ink tank printers. twice or max thrice the cost but worth it and effective plus cost saving.
Color photo quality is worst of all the printers (Epson, HP, Canon) i have used on kodak paper.
Cartridge charges (rs. 700 each) are too high and yield is like max 40 color photos/print and 80 Black n white prints.
I had some urgent need of photos so took the printer in use and all i can see is the pink color photos.
Very bad experience with HP this time.",1
Worst...after 20 pages b@w ink showing low...nd dat was only documents print out..,1
"Product is really nice, I have booked Canon first, but it was faulty. So ordered this HP2622. What I felt is the plastic quality is much better in HP.

First when you on the printer, connect to the printer using Wifi, then one page will open there you can connect the printer to Wifi network

Only problem I noticed is when I put single paper, the paper does not go properly inside and the printer throws feed error. After multiple attempts (30time) figured out that the paper to be inserted below the roller to have proper feed or else the roller will pull the paper one side, this is definitely some problem to fix or what I dont know",4
"The printer is good, but the black cartridge got over in just about 45 pages printing, not satisfied with this though, haven’t counted on the colour printing yet...",2
"The colour cartridge sent with the printer is defective.
So either replace the whole order or replace the cartridge by tomorrow.",5
"Many buyer's here complaining about wifi setup for printer is hard, Might be taken note of by HP. With hp smart setup application for mobile and desktop/laptop it was seamless experience and really easy to setup printer + wifi for wireless priniting without any trouble. Infact, mentally i was ready to face same problem but no such problem faced by me luckily.

As of now, I am not using any USB cable to take my printout, Everything via Wifi, Be it from laptop or Mobile. In case, Anyone still feels the same issue, Refer to the blue book titled Reference and Support. On 1st page in bottom you will find the solution itself.

Cons - For now only 1. Explained below.
I gave 4 star because, Ink is fast depleting property be it color or black. In case you have daily print out of anything more then 5-6 pages, Don't opt for it. Otherwise, Excellent for Kid's homework and minimum printing job.",4
The printer is good obviously so no issues there but initially i was given a used product which i wasn't happy with i got the replacement and it was great. I liked the product as its compatible with all my devices as long as it's connected to my wifi. Without the wifi i can connect the printer to my laptop and presto!! It works. My advice please look up the setup videos by hp before you get started.,5
"I've been reviewing it . After my 8 months of usage . This is a low load printer . I never expected slow print from this product . I've been looking for better one again .

Pros:
* Speed in Connectivity
* Easy to access at low price
* Compatibility
* Easy to equip and less weight.
* Colored prints

Cons:
* No double side print available
* Sometimes we've to wait to load
* Maintenance is bit high compare to laser jet",3
"I bought this printer for home use. The cost and features are good. You can print from mobile as well. The wireless printing works very well. The printer is quite good.

Now comes the catch. The cartridge cost. HP 803 original black and color cartridge costs anywhere between 1200 to 1500 rupees. Contrary to the claim I was able to print not more than 50 pages before the ink dried. It could be that ink dried due to non usage for couple of months. However, the cost of new cartridge is mind blowing. Looks like companies make money out cartridges.",3
"HP needs to work on improving customer experience. It's a nightmare trying to get the drivers and getting the WiFi feature work with the product. I choose to use cable for quick printing. Print quality is ok ok. Packing was good. Comes with cartridge. For scanning, one need to have hp snart app installed and nedd to use it for giving scan command to printer.",3
"We received this product and unfortunately did not start using it within the 10 day period allotted for returns. So once we tried to use it we had continual issues printing, it actually didn't print. After many calls with HP support they agreed to send a technician after they realized it was a printer defect. The technician came and then said he would have to come back with a replacement part. After that visit he no longer responded to our calls or texts and we've been unable to get a hold of anyone from customer support. We've had this printer now for a month and it hasn't worked nor are we able to get it repaired or replaced. Terrible experience.",1
"Pros
Good looking with pure white exterior
Easy to install
Cons
Longer lasting cartridge is a false statement, i got the new printer with dry cartridge, had to order a new one, which dried out with 20 to 30 pages
Bulky
White color sure looks good but prone to getting dusty
Always takes 2 to 3 attempts to connect with phone app
I used the 3050 model prior to this for 6 years and still find print quality better in that
Cartridge is difficult to find in ecommerce sites and even in HP online
No resale value - due to the cost of cartridge and very short self life, nobody wants this printer",2
"Printer is really good, easy to setup and operate. Very handy with print copy and scan.
Unfortunately soon after printing two papers, I started seeing problem with the default cartridges that came with the printer.",3
This is my favourite product that I brought in 2019. Easy to install and use and the wifi connectivity is also strong. I brought it for printing homeschooling materials. And it’s working efficiently plus it’s budget friendly when you manually refill the ink. You need to be a little patience with the ink filling thing. Scanning & copy also functions smoothly.,5
"Printer good.wifi function dont require other working hot spot as it has its own wifi to connect mobile or ipad.so nice use.
Issue with hp 803 cartridge orignal orderd from amazon but printer didnt recognise it.techincal support team said to clean points of contact and all but nothing happnes now my printer is usless on table .just first cartridge change caused issue.also coslty cartridges .so not recomend",3
"I bought it bcoz of brand name.
And it proved
Great print quality but it could be better.
It's easy to install.
Easy to use.
Effortlessly print.
The cartridge should print more pages.
The cost per print should be less.
Overall it's best in its price range.",5
"A good printer for beginners or school kids, because it's very simple to setup and use, but the high CPP @Rs.5 to Rs.7 is not worth it. Will discard it very soon and get an ink tank all in one with auto duplex ADF. Don't let the low initial cost fool you, at best you can get about a yield of 100 b/w pages, so unless you absolutely need a printer immediately and can't afford the initial cost of an ink tank, I would strongly advise against buying this.",3
"I made a mistake... humble request to you please don't purchase this...
Warranty got over its not working ( not turning on) machine has turned into a piece of junk .. after warranty service is too bad, no troubleshooting steps over the phone for every single thing you need to take it to the service center....
Cartridges too costly
Installation easy but print yeild is very low.
Those who think that this printer's supplied cartridge will yeild around 50-60 pages(colour or black) are highly mistaken it didn't give me a yeild more than 10-15 pages (colour) & 20-25 pages(black) .
So if you think that this is going to give you a high yeild so you must give a second thought about it.
Wireless connectivity is easier but it goes worse if the button is pressed,creates problems in reconnecting with the wifi
I requested for replacement but Amazon team cancelled and it's returning to seller now I can't get a replacement I need to wait for the sale so as to get it's price dropped bcoz it's the second time it's price has increased from 3699 to 4499 now...",1
THE printer is fine .service was good but the problem is..IT IS BETTER TO BUY A NEW PRINTER THAN A NEW CARTRIDGE..i always use genuine things but this printer is only worth 3 colorful pictures..that is it..even black and white depletes before 40 prints..if the pictures are not that colorful then may be a few more..HP or any other printing companies needs to see this..the manufacturing costs for this cartridges are not that much..but still it is unfairly priced..you can not heavily print at all not even lightly..that is the problem..it has to be more efficient,4
I liked the printer for the price and quality. But the free cartridge which I received with the printer was defected. And had to buy a new cartridge. So just because of the black cartridge I wasted my 3 days thinking y the prints r not clear. And when I gave the colour ND black and white print separately I figured that the black cartridge is a defect that the seller has given me.,5
"On receiving the printer I was able to connect the printer wirelessly and print copies without any issues. But the second time since I moved out to another Wi-Fi network I am unable bring the printer to set up more and connect the printer to the network. I tried a lot but unable to get the printer to connect to Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi light keeps blinking does not stay on.
Can someone help me? I cannot return the product as the return Window is closed.",1
"Would suggest look for a notch upper hp printer. , this is for the basic home user , has WiFi connectivity for easy prints directly from mobile . Installation took a bit of time with WiFi not getting connected properly but once done then it was working fine . Too many pages get sometimes stuck though",3
I bought this product yesterday and tested all its functions which are working perfectly. Results are very good. So far so good.......rest time will tell,5
"This is very worst product. Cartridge stopped working after 20 page print. And help line said go to service centre which is more than 90 km, and they said buy new cartridge which is 1800 INR cost. Now think guys printer is 3000 n cartridge is 2000. Don't buy this hp is robbing Indian customer s.
Anyone can call me

I want to sell this dabba for 1000. 2 months old.
PRAFUL

"Basic problem? The paper in mechanism. IT DOESN'T TAKE IN PAPER. Its a vertical feed at the rear, and horizontal out the front. Either the paper just dosen't get pulled in, OR gets pulled in titled to one side (right) and hence the printout is skewed, OR (USUALLY) the paper tilts a bit, then remains there, while the printer prints (no idea on what!) And shows the job done. In last 40 tries Ive only managed 1 print and 2 photocopies. DON'T BUY.",1
"Product design is user Friendly n quality of prints is as expected. Scanner, plugin printer works well with pdf format. Wifi seems to be working at its own pace. Cartridges get empty after just fifty print outs so additional cartridges are a must. Albeit it is a VFM product. Thank you.",5
"Very Bad packaging and products
Don't buy this Printer
Don't buy HP product
Don't buy
Very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very Bad
Don't buy HP product
Don't buy this product",1
"The worst product ever , color print quality is pathetic , never trust on this brand with low price , I have already purchased 2 cartridge for color print and its showing lines while printing and there is no gaurantee warrantee. I m not a happy customer.

Now it doesn't print at all paper stuck nothing happening.",1
"CHEATED BY THE SELLER!!!!
The cartridges were empty. On the very first use, the colour ink was so so so light that I could hardly see any print.
The black cartridge was empty and didn’t give a single print.
The cartridges alone cost us 1500₹. I had to again order them separately.",1
"The most horrible printer I have ever worked with. Getting the alignment juuust right is pure luck and, whenever I want a printout, luck is never on my side. So for me get a printout, my stars should align right. Thankfully, the scanning is fine, otherwise life is just too cruel.",1
Worst printer in terms of cost per print. I got it around 40 days back. I hardly printed around 50-60 pages. Mostly black and white. It has already started giving the warning that the cartridge levels are very low. New cartridges are very costly. We can get the laser printouts outside at a very cheaper cost. I seriously regret about this purchase.,1
"dont buy this product.
after one week the printer is working by itself
when printer is power on the printer continously printing the page i have printed 2 days before and just printing the same copy of page a number of times as the given paper is over",1
"This is one of the best printer given by hp at affordable price but you have to spend a lot on its cartridge (costly).

One thing everyone should note that it is for home use only not for bulk printing .

If you want for bulk printing you should not purchase it because afterwards you will complain that it is costly.
I think they are earning more money by selling cartridges not by selling printers.

The cartridge is for one time use only after that you have to throw it and purchase a new one
Also it consumes ink very much.",4
"Never ever but this useless hp printer . The one thing which is not mentioned here is that you have to always change the cartridge, you don't have an option to fill the ink it is for single use only and the rate of cartridge is around 2000 for 200 pages , so it costs very much than other printers",1
"All seems good but if only 1 paper is placed in the printer tray, it does not accept or fetch the paper. The printer expects at least 2 papers to print properly otherwise, it tries to pull the paper but does not and then gives an error saying paper stuck or no paper. It took me more than a month to realize this. The ink provided in the box dried up in less than a month. Looks like very old stock of ink provided.",3
"Consumes ink very fast. Like 20 coloured prints only. However, I love taking out prints from my phone via bluetooth. Easy to connect but wont create a hotspot from my phone and print from same phone. You need to have a separate wifi or hotspot with both printer and device on that wifi/hotspot.",5
"Very useful and all features are fine. Scanner is good and overall worth the price. But no idea why it keeps printing test pages whenever switched on. Quickly wastes the ink because of that, so I just don't keep the papers loaded. I'm having to cancel the print jobs and then load the paper.",4
It was easy to install by following the online instructions. Just bought the printer and so far don't have any problems with it.,5
The Print cartridges doesn't even last for 50 pages. this is outright scam from HP. sell printer below cost and then sell low quality cartridges which don't even last 50 pages for inflated prices at 3 times the cost. better buy a Canon printer which has option for ink refills and cartridges are also of reasonable cost and the print quality is far superior,1
"NOT as per the mentioned in the description. There are many other options to go for BUT this. The best thing I could say about this; is it has printed 5 pages at one go. Now you can consider it ""sarcasm"" or whatever.",2
good quality print. but connectivity issues arises sometimes. capability to be added as a network printer. hp service is real good. when a problem occurred to the scanner they came and changed the scanner assembly. 1 disadvantage is the printer ink is costly and it will be finished very fast.,4
"The paper is fed from behind in smaller quantities, and it has a plastic i guess to avoid dust going in. But very inconvenient. Not the best of design. Not happy after buying, but its used at home for kids for their school home work hence tolerating it.",1
"Bought it and got the delivery yesterday. Installation and setting up wireless was little tricky but have Youtube videos to guide them. Printed a test page and all good. Need to check Photo print quality with photo paper and add to this comment if any. Otherwise, its value for money spent.",5
"This is a useless piece of machine and my second HP printer (other one lasted 1 year) , it doesnt load paper correctly and i have to keep pushing paper every time and ink dries up faster that water dries up in the Sahara desert.",2
"On day one with 10-12 prints black cartridges finished.
Amazon delivery time was good
Installation is simple
But cartridges are finished with 4-5 colour prints and 10-15 black one",1
Cartridge is ideal for them who print few pages in a month .... The black cartridge got over the one day received ... Advice everyone to buy printer that contain ink tank . More over page the page margin of buttom is very low.. It stop almost before 1 of the a4 page,3
"Competent printer, works as advertised. Difficult install. Starter cartridge of black ink lasted exactly 35 pages. For that reason alone, i will no longer buy HP products. Epson, Brother, etc. don't cheat consumers like this. Black cartridge costs Rs 850 to buy. I will be refilling, for sure.",2
"We got the product on Saturday(20th July 2019) and resembled following instruction, the printer is not recognising the colour cartridge, I tried every possible way to connect to HP customer care but the number is not getting connected. I am feeling very bad about the HP customer care. I want to replace the product with Amazon, but they want us to connect to HP service center. I am feeling I am trapped in between. So buyers think before you buy from Amazon, istead buy it from HP center, then may be you will not have to suffer mental tension.",1
The only drawback is they have made the cartridge in such a way that it will not work if you try to refil it. Every time you have to buy a new cartridge which is very expensive.. they make money in cartridge not with the printer.. buy it only if you are lazy or too busy to go out to get the prints,3
It’s value for money and the print quality is excellent. This is the reason I have ordered for one more item for my brother. I love it.,5
"Very good and usefull especially the wifi option allow you to print from mobile and tab without connecting to printer

Has scanning color and bw xerox and printing option ideal for home use",5
Strongly Suggest Not to buy this printer not just because of bad Experience but the print quality is also the same... And More or less hardly 20 black printout have taken out and Shows Catridge is empty .... Seriously not at all happy with the product.,1
It’s a product I strongly recommend not to buy. The price of each print is very high in a long run until you stop using it and go to local printing shop,1
"Print is good but ink cartridge is expensive and ink some time mess around,app is not available on all devices and it consume lot around 60MB, others app consume 5,10MBfor the same work and it's app say's to change ink cartridge every small problem.I refill the ink cartridge even ink cartridge is full it ink cartridge is not original.Print is good but the company cheats to buy costly ink cartridge",5
Not at a value for money product. I recommend not to buy it . You can take only blank page to make cartridge life . After printing for 35 pages with 1/3rd of ink is gone yet half of the page to be printed is empty . Worst product if you think about value for money,1
"Product is very good ,but ink consumption/efficiency is not much (off course due to this price range). For less home users it is good",4
Not suggestable to buy as the cartridges are very small and requires frequent refills,2
"A very light weight printer. I've been using it for a while now and its pretty good. The initial setup can be a little confusing and a bit frustrating but once that's through, printing is a delight. The mobile app makes everything so convenient that I don't think going back to desktop printing would easy.",5
"Handy and compact all in one printer, where just a power source is needed and remaining all actions can be performed from mobile itself without the need of connecting printer to laptop or desktop unless needed.
worthy for the amount!!",5
"One of the best printer which i have seen, user friendly and important is works in wireless and can give print from mobile with HP Smart App. Highly recommended for home office uses",5
"Just a few days of buying the printer would not pull in paper sheets to print although we had atleast 5 sheets in the tray, last 2 days even though we have proper ink levels we are getting no prints at all. The output is blank.",1
"Perfect for home use, connects to Laptop or mobile over wifi superfast...very convenient to use...but i k in cartriges is very less ..i refilled both of them using Ptodot ink...now happy that i can print photos cheaply at home...",5
"B&W printing is very good. Colour printing is not so much good but it is average. I think it depends upon how you refill the cartage. Of course easy to install and easy to use but if I am talking about wireless printing, it is difficult to set up in your mobile. There is hp plugin but that won't work. For wireless printing from your mobile, you need to install ""PrinterShare"" app from google play.",4
"Print quality is very superb. But installing procedures are just difficult for me. And another amazon delivery processing are very speed , why I can say that I ordered 20th October Delivered 21th October. And print cottage are not SATISFYING for got a more prints . Anothers its are nice and perfect for home and small office uses. Then thanku for all.",4
The print quality is very good and the speed of print is even better. What i did not like is amount of ink the printer is consuming. Its a few weeks of ownership and after printing may be about 12-15 pages the black ink is already at half-way mark. And inks dont come cheap,4
"Product is very good. Installation is a bit problematic since one has to install oneself, the company team gives instructions as to install over phone only. But for this, product is good.",4
"Amazon india,
It seems the printer gives wrong information when printing start. Both the cartridges are brand new and massage popped,`incomparable or failed cartridges`
Photo attached herewith.
Please reply immediately to help me to make a decision.
Thanks.",1
"Printer is just opposite to HP logo "" keep it simple"". I bought this printer for my 7 year old child to support in online learning. However I was very disappointed to see that no onsite support is available. Just returned after few hours.",1
"Print quality is average. The major problem is printer takes lots of time for spooling.it means sometimes it takes 15 mins to print 2-3 pages. Also, many times it aborts in between print wasting time,ink and paper. It's meant for one side print only.",1
The ink of the printer finished jus after printing a maximum of 20 pgs..and now the printer has become too slow.,2
Problem prone and silly recurring cost of 803 Cartridges.... better avoid such misleading products packGed in low cost listing.The cartridges fail and cant take a refill.,1
Only 30 pages color print you can take in one shot.,1
This is worst product I purchased from amazon . The printed format work properly and it gives double image print and it’s very slow I have to wait 5 mins to take in e print out . I requested return of product the very next day but amazon delayed and now I’m not able to return the products. Amazon fools people with damaged products .,1
Don't go for inkjet printer ever ! The cost of maintenance of this printer is way tooo high !! You need to sale everything you have to maintain this printer ! Suggest you to make sure for laser jet than inkjet printers !,1
"I just didn't replace it bcoz of it's print quality. It's ink runs off very quickly and if you call an expert from hp, they just print a report and start showing you no. of pages printed. If you don't have that much stuff to print then you should buy this otherwise it's not for you.",3
"It's totally wastage of money. I have just printed about 20 pages and ink got empty.
And carriage is little bit coastly. I suggest u to buy ink tank printer that will print many pages n easy to buy ink and it will be cheaper",1
"Printer works as expected. Print quality is decent. Easy to setup. Prints wirelessly from mobile app over wifi. Wired connection available. Replacement Ink cartridges may be a bit pricey 800 to 1000 rupees individual, or 1600 rupees if bought together.",5
"Printer cartridges are very expensive it costs around colour 1200 and black and white 600, and that to it capacity is only 120 max page so try go with ink tank printer don't make mistake like me over all the print quality and everything is good but remember quantity matter a lot so choose right one for you.",3
"Just got it yesterday. Wireless installation steps were very easy. Print/Scan/Copy tried two/three times. Quality was good.
Rest of the feedback will be provided after using it for few months.",4
The cartridge gets over after just 20-25 pages printing. And both color and black cartridges are required to be bought. It's very expensive. I've replaced 3 sets of cartridges in 2 months,1
"I bought this couple of months back. After nearly 40 prints, it does not work. Either it prints lines lines or blank page. No error message anywhere. Customer care is bad. i don't suggest anyone to buy this.",1
"Worst printer ever prints only 10 pages in full cartridge, connection problem occurs every time.

Waste of money don't buy ever.",1
"Nice wireless printer. connects easily with mobile, iPad, laptop very easily, also can be connected with multiple devices. very easy to print. colour printout quality is also good. need to install HP app. you also get to know levels of ink on the app.",5
Sleek. Setup was smooth and quick. Print quality excellent. Will comment on cartridge consumption once adequately used. Print from anywhere in your house. Highly recommended.,5
"Printer does not print black. Doen not connect with laptop or mobile. After calling amazon, They say contact HP. Now i am not sure when HP customer care will respond.",1
Quality of products is very nice. But it’s very difficult to set up. Cartridge is very much expensive. I would like to suggest that go with laser printer it will be costly bit but cartridge will be easy to deploy.,2
Best product at this price range and fast on-time delivery by amazon and printing quality is very good although printing cost is some high overall go for it if you want it for home use or for small shop or buisness,5
It's easy to install and lighter in weight. The printing speed is little slow in color printing and ok type in black and white printing. The cartilage get exhausted pretty fast.. Only cons.. But overall good product for home and kids assignment.,5
It's working good. Print quality is good. Easy to setup.,4
Printing cartridges are too costly for this printer. No. of pages Printing output is too low!,3
The printer is a perfect fit and does not require big space. Easy and comfortable to use and print quality is fine too,5
"Things i like:-
Nice printing quality
Easy to take print,xerox and scan
Wireless
Things i don't like:-
Low ink capacity
Little wet after printing
Hard to setup to windows
High rate cadridge",5
Good product. Only drawback is that the ink consumption is very high. I was able to print only 20 pages with the ink which came in the box.,4
"I use it 18 month , no problem issue black and colour print much good as printers cost. I print about 4000 page and cartage running so good . One time refiling print about 70-80 page (black)",5
"After 15-20 Pages its showing ink low and getting poor quality print. I bought cartridge for RS.2,400.00 again i face the same issue after 2 weeks and only print 20 pages. Don't buy this product totally waste of money..",1
"I could print only 60 print till date ,6 months passed ,Print Quality is good but if u want bulk print not advisable cause printing cost is too high ,Per page cost comes to 10 Rs Approx",1
Very poor quality of product.....half of the time you will keep setting it up.... It does not accept paper easily... Major hardware problem. Avoid at all costs..,1
Operating costs is too high the cartridge price is too high that too yield less print m at loss exchange option should be there,1
It's took long time to take colour print and sometimes stucks the paper inside worst product...,1
Printer quality is damn good...working great..you can easily print photos....printing time tooks 30 sec...a bit slow...but overall it's a good product from hp,4
Printer broke down within 2 months of purchased. The cartridges were not getting detected. When I took it to service centre they told me one of the part is need to be replaced. Had not expected HP to sell such faulty products. Really disappointed.,1
"Even with ink tank full...print quality is poor, any number of cleaning does not help. Yes I am using HP cartridges!!!!",1
For home purposes only. Very often use. Its ink is very costly . Print quality is good.,3
I had a very bad experience with this printer. I took only 10-12 color prints on A4 size paper and hardly 5-10 black and white prints. It is showing colour is low to print. Waste of money and I won’t recommend to buy this printer at all.,1
The printing from a laptop or over wifi is next to impossible.We had to reinstall multiple times for the phone to print to work.Thankfully just before my son's exam.very disappointed,2
"prints on photo paper not as expected, just okay for student's projects, ink cartridge's are too costly",3
Creating an account downloading the app and then connecting is quite a pain ...rest is fine,3
Please don't buy worst picture quality and customer service...... Please don't buy..... Even amazon not helping me to replace this item......,1
"U can see better than this in online shop. . . It specified that ., It can print 355 page. . . I jus got around 30-40 pages only. . . Very poor cartridges. . . Even refilling also not responding. . . Don't go for this. . .",2
"Prints are too expensive..the HP ads that it will only cost a few paises per print is totally false, amounts to cheating. I should never have bought the printer, getting prints from neighbourhood print shops was way more convenient and cost efficient.",1
"The black cartage is empty
Please give me a new cartage",3
"The ink is getting over very often just for 20 papers after reffilling,from last 3 week the print is not good ,the whole paper is black,we don't know what the problem is..this is the main drawback of this product",3
"Do Not Buy It
Yes it just waste of time
It can only print less than 20 pages of black and white and colour print
Dont waste your money 😕😕
Buy another good printer rather than this
I am not lying
Belive me 😨😨😨😨",1
Its a good product.can be used for small works in home. The only problem was in connecting the printer with wifi.👍,3
"Easy to install, use and excellent color quality. However need to ensure you print properly Color/Black n white",5
You can buy low price printer then this printer is good for you but printer quality and installation is not good,3
"Frist i thought a very good printer but i change my review
A printer which is easy to use but ink cartridge problem is gives printer zero mark as ink in cartridge delayed after 2 month and cartridge is costly",1

Good printer for personal use. No problem with connectivity and print quality. But the only issue is that theink get used very faster.,4
Printer is good but the cartridges gets over very fast. The Tri color cartridges was used up after printing around 12 pcs of A4 size paper on single page per paper and the ink is quite expensive. Even though the printer is good but due to the above reason will not recommend anyone.,4

inspite bad reviews I bought the printer thinking it should be quality product from HP. Less than 30 prints the ink got over. The cost of ink is so high that you can purchase a new printer again. Worst and third grade printer do not waste your money on this.,1
Cartages were dry. No ink in it. Not working cartages.,2
I am giving this review after using it for 1 month and I will definitely say this printer is fabulous and the quality of the prints are also very good but it's little bit hard to install but won't worry you can install it via the manual Guide provided to you.,4

"Refill cartridge is very costly and it consumes ink very faster
Very bad its a burden on your pocket

And cartridge doesn't work with ink Refill by ink bottles

Total waste of money",2
Very cost per page printing. Initial black cartridge exhausted after hardly 40 printouts. Very disappointing. Information about the printing says around 160-180 pages. Totally false . Cost of new cartridge is around 900+.,1

Fake product. Not Hellwet and Packard. Its chineese Hongfugin Precision Electronics. China,1
Barely printed 50 pages and the black ink cartridge which comes along gave away. Went to refill the same and found out there was hole in the cartridge and the entire ink leaked. What sort of QC does HP has?,1
Use and throw product. If u have money go for other products as you will have to spend all your money on catridges which may or may not work well. Waste of money. Go for products where ink tank is there. This is a disappointing purchase,1

"Please don't go on the initial cost of the Printer as the it might seem very cheap.
However, the cartage will cost you about Rs. 900/- for 190 pages as HP claims .

Although, My initial cartage didnt even last for 109 pages , so its very very expensive printer even for a Home use .",1
Good all-in-one printer. printing speed slower than expected. however the print quality of prints is good. easily usable on iOS and MacOS High Sierra. Just follow the instructions.,5
It is a good AIO in this price. Scan quality is bit low. But it has some good features like WiFi connectivity. Also I can print from anywhere in the world to the printer over Internet. It is quite compared to old printers.,4
checked warranty status on HP website shows only 9 months remaining instead of 1 year. Delivered product is different from dispalying image. Purchased 4 days before.,2
"The 803Bk Cartridge prints over just 100 Pages , Hence buying a cartridge for approximately Rs. 800 and and printing just 100 word document pages , surely tell you high your printing cost goes up. So if they suggest you should use this printer only if your printing is approximately 250-400 pages per month i would again say no as , would suggest this printer only if you have 100 pages per month.",3
"In common with most inkjet printers it is a little flimsy but worked fine, and the WiFi connectivity was a bonus! It was good while it lasted, but then developed a terminal hardware error after 2 years and had to be discarded.",3
Not cost of worth..slow printing taking observing huge colour,2
"Printer was awsm
I purchased it 2 days before...
Print quality it outstanding and at affordable price

Just the con is it requires admin name and password that is not provided anywhere..",4
Waste product only 20 copy done then empty cartigue,1
Very clear printing and definitely worth the price (I bought it during great Indian sale),5
Easy set up. Value for money. But the setup cartridge of black and color which came with printer in box are giving only few pages about 15 or 20 may be for setup purpose only. Wireless setup is also easy. Can download from web for latest version.,5
Awesome product it's printing speed is normal the best benefit is that it's wireless and can be done over phone,4
"Its worth the money, as providing all the features as promised. If you want a better print/scan quality look for higher model, this is just for home mild usage not for professionals.",4
Not a cost effective,4
This is amazing... The set-up cartridge lasts long... Prints fairly quickly... But it is a bit noisy... Very good... Not too heavy...,5
"Easy to use printer, the wifi function is fantastic",5
"Print is good

This up deskjet is a good printer but my problem is not with this printer but with its payment .,4
Sometimes the speed becomes low while printing and sometimes Paper intake also does not work ... not well but its ok...,1
This product is not up to the mark and it's not working properly since I bought it.,2
Not satisfied at all.,1
"I have received a defective printer. The microchip is not registering inserted catridges. Please check your product within 10 days of buying. I normally trust Amazon alot so I did not check the printer myself. This was my mistake. It seems they are counting on us to not check if the printer works. After 10 days if you check and find its not working, you cannot replace the item. Just a headsup from a frustrated customer. Stay safe.",1
"cartage is too costly.
per print costing is 10rs",1

Worst product not working one cartrage showing empty dont buy it,1
"It turns out to be a costlier printer. i have hardly printed 10 sheets, but both the black & colour cartidges are showing very low ink level warnings. The replacement cost was Rs 2002. At this rate, per page printing works out to over Rs 200, as against their advertised cost of Rs 0.10. it is a total waste of money to buy this printer",2
"Good for wireless printing.
Satisfied.",5
"Please don't buy this printer because of its waste of money purchase printer in primday and I'm printed only 10 pages of color print then printer showing , low catreges and nest page not possible to print .",1
"Perfect and excellent, no accessories missing. 100% satisfied. Thanks to Amazon and merchant do your excellent services.",5
Don't buy these products. ink cartridges aren't refillable. Worst products in market by hp. Everytime you can't buy ink cartridge of rs 700 for 120 pages. So better you go for inkjet printers.,1
Very disappointed...both color and black cartridge get over after only 120-150 pages...I have only taken black and white prints but the color cartridge keeps getting finished...I have bought genuine cartridges...customer care is unhelpful and need me to take the cartridges for checking at their service center halfway across the city...Regretting the purchase...would definitely not recommend,1
Black print cost per page is Rs. 6. Let that sink in. They sell printer cheap and earn from ink.,1
Just like maintaining a elephant!! Your pocket gets burned due to cartridge replacement. Better to take print out in shops,3
"Drink ink like tequila...buy bit costlier printer and save in ink
Cheap printer == costlier ink",1
Bad product printer is not working so product changed plz or I want to change this product plz plz plz,1
"Cartridge is very high in price and it couldn't able to print at least 100 copies with new cartridge. It has a disadvantage sometimes didn't show the print preview in app and the connectivity is best in printer and it is easy to setup, easy to connect and easy to print through supported apps,",4
"This product is very very very bad
Please don't buy this product any body.becuse per print rate is lose fully. 1 cartridge Rs.730, 2 cartridge rate RS. 1460 cartridge Range 100 to 150 pages. Please take return my product.",1
"Worst product, cartridge are costly. Refilling of cartridge damages the cartridge. Better to go for different product for better experience.",1
Quality of printing is not Gud often automatically printing some printer guide... Wasting colour ink great idea of HP to purchase ink again and again which is tooooooo costly ...even I have return policy time they neglected to take return,1
"4500 for printer and 1000Rs for ink every month.. instead a epson printer which is a little costlier is much better to have a much much lower annual maintenance cost

HP is a swindler in this case",1
"Product is not good, WiFi is not connected properly and speeds is very low.
I am facing problem from this",1
"NIce compact printer,good for home use, easy to set up , fits nicely in the computer cabinet, good print quality and nice and easy scanning also.",5
All the aspects of the printer is good but the ink provided in the box got empty very fast. Even they did not give any replacement catridges.,4
"cartage very bad qulity and only print 20 papers
and it is not proparli refilling cartage is vry bad and very bad please dont purchase it",1
Printing cost was very high and ink consumb more than pages. Only 50-60 pages of black and white print .,4
Nice product for small scale printing. Not preferred for bulk print,5
Very nice product easy installation and use best product,5
"Printer has been installed yesterday at the place of Dr. Ganguly to whom I have gifted on the occasion of teachers day.

Amazon gives 10% on the name of 15%.
Wifi gives best performance with Mobile and Computer. It will suspect that 550 pages will be printed. Special hardware and software are good. Print quality is quite good. I have tested the quality of print, scan and copy, it is quite good. Well worth the price. You can buy HP deskjet Model-2622 All in one. Thanks.",5

"Pros: Delivered in time. Setup is easy. Liked Mobile app feature. Did test prints and satisfied. Got full volume of ink in default print cartridges, which are 680 series. These cost RS 1150 as combo, for kind information to co-custumers.

Cons: The power socket was wobbling, a poor design. But I managed with a tape inside so it holds good. This is on the down side.

Caution: Any printer goes for a toss as the time passes because of dust accumulation. I had the experiences of dysfunction of wifi connection, double side printing, paper injection mechanism etc. This is my 4th printer in series. Bought printer cover as well because for me dust control is top priority given the worst experiences in the past.

Value for money at the price of RS 5999/. Flipkart sells at RS 4999 or 5199. Amazon should compete here.

Trust the above helps.",4
"My cartridge ink is over within a week, I have not taken even 100 prints also. Never used color as well. Bad quality cartridge. False promise on the number of prints it gives.",3
Print quality is good but the cartridge performace is so poor. Just print 75 paper and cartridge empty.,3
Got the product with no cartridge and with one used cartridge in machine where black was empty and color was half.....also packing of old quality as if used piece,5
"Worst product . Especially software for this product is very poor.
Need 8 apps to run a simple printer.
That too tiring steps that will take almost one day for successful installation if you are lucky.
Cursing my self for buying this.
Please buy some other Printer
I am using printers for past 20 years never faced such a tragedy",1
This is the position of the catridge after just one print. Totally dissatisfied with the catridge quality. Installation is way too easy. Printing directly from smartphone is also easy. Nice product but useless catridges.,3
"1 Printer Cartridge will print ~80-100 pages(one side only) only and that too when we took print in Economic mode, Plus if you try any hack to refill cartridge...It would not work at all. Every time you have to buy cartridge of Rs. 650-750 range... If u r ready to spend Rs. 8-10 per page(single side) you can go for it. They are earning money by selling highly priced cartridges and low cost printers...It is a trap..

Don't buy, our most regretted shopping ever.",1
"Bought this product absolutely two months back, Now i am getting a error msg on the screen Cartridge is not compatible with this printer, and when i talk to the Hp Customer care and this is one of the worst customer support that they got. They are asking me to buy a new Cartridge, Very Funny.......Simple Words, Only worth for Two Months, If you got an extra day or Month you are very lucky.....Worst Product, and More Worst Customer Support...",1
"It so harrasing ,not easy to set up ,it takes more time and total disappointed",1
"Printing quality is very impressive, you can choose up to various printing modes like draft, normal & best, you can directly print by hp smart app from your phone, there is a mobile fax option too, Printing speed is also fast but not very fast, main problem I m facing is an alignment problem in an input tray, whenever I want one print out then additional sheets also come in an output tray automatically sometimes though they are not printed but still it's frustrating. Overall it's a good printer by hp.",4
"Easy to handling and good connectivity throught WiFi and Easy to install and good product to use and maintain easy. Category also 680/- RS something, both black nd white and colour",5
Very poor quality product. The printer was making loud noise and yesterday its stop working. I hardly printed 10 sheets. Yesterday when I was trying to Print a page i found its making a loud noise and on opening the front panel i found that cartridge was banging left and right and then came the shock i found two pieces of a platstic strip. On research i found it is called encoder strip. I am frustrated and don't know how to fix it.,1
"Nice printer for home use at this price. Printing speed is little bit slow however for home use it's manageable. Overall printing quality is good.
I am not sure how much prints we can get from one set of cartridge but as of now we took 50 prints and still the cartridge showing 75%.",5
"I received a very cheap quality printer as i used only for one time second time it was not getting on, as I came to know that mother board is out of service,worst! pls think before buying it.",1
"Althoughh the printer is very good, the promised extra black cartridge has not been sent along with the printer.
the gift voucher of Rs. 1000/- which can be used in BATA and other outlets not enclosed. Please arrange for immediate compliance.",4
"So far good prints. Didn't use high quality paper till now so can't give any review on that. 80 gsm paper prints are good. Good for school projects. Loving the scanner. Document feeder is a relief when scanning multiple papers. Photocopy print quality is manageable, definitely not great. Great thing is any material can be scanned, ofcourse that shouldn't exceed A4 size and shouldn't be sharp. I scanned the front of a purse and it came out very nice.",5
Not see,3
"I was confused with Canon pixma E560 and HP 3835 but after searching all reviews and HP support system I bought HP. Only disadvantage with this is that it does not have auto duplex feature. But other good features like print speed/no. pages weigh down that disadvantage. Go for it if you are looking for long term, home/small office use wireless printer.",5
"The product looks good and also i dont have any complain for quality but the issue is with the cost per print, i have installed 3 sets of cartridges and in one set not able to print more than 15 - 17 pages, so its better not to print anything on this, its a showcase product for me now... i strongly suggest not to but this product",1
OUTSTANDING PRODUCT FROM HP VERY SATISFIED AND ULTRAFAST DELIVERY FROM AMAZON I ORDERED IT YESTERDAY IT SHIPED TODAY AT 12:02 AM AND GOT IT TODAY AT 4:42 PM VERY ULTRA FAST DELIVERY FROM AMAZON I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT ALL THE FEATURES ARE EASY AND USEFUL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE READING MY COMMENT TRUST ME IT IS THE OUTSTANDING PRODUCT FROM HP NO ISSUES WITH HARDWARE SYSTEM ALSO ACCEPTS IT EASILY YOU CAN BUT IT,5
"Overall I am satisfied with this product. Did not check print quality for an image.

Pros
1. Value for money in this price range
2. Easy to install
3. Looks great
4. Touch display

Cons
1. Copy quality is not sharp
2. Eprint feature is not easy to configure. You need to assign static IP on your printer to use this feature.
3. “Print anywhere” feature is not available on this model. The HP smart app on the mobile detects printer only on home network where the printer is available.",5
"This is one of the worst printers from hp. Installation, connection, ease of use everything is fine. BUT IT JUST DOES NOT PRINT IN COLOUR. I have been wasting days with tech support trying to resolve the issue, but nothing has happened till date. I asked for a replacement, they behave as if they can't even read that line. They just keep making case ids after case ids.
I've been using hp printers for over 2 decades, never had any single issue with any of them.

IF YOU WANT A HASSLEFREE PRINTER... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER... REST IS YOUR CHOICE!",1
"I bought it around 3 weeks ago, and found it really useful and up to the good standards. So far no problem. HP Smart print app enables print from anywhere. Dedicated printer email id enables me to print anything by sending the document to hpeprint.com email address.

The size of the printer was a little larger than I expected, but that's fine. Also, not sure if anyone uses Fax these days.

Overall a good buy.",5
Product is really good but No extra Black ink included,5
"2 days after buying the product i m facing printing issue for which i tried to contact to HP service care but they are just saying that , your call will be transferred to so called senior. and after that i waited for half an hour then they disconnect the call. this happens every time.
when i asked that why u r not connecting after tranfering the call then they replied that its not my problem.

who is responsible for it?

now i will take some leagal action against it if i will not be served within 2 days.",1
"Print quality is great, very easy to install and operate but within two months of purchase the document feeder stopped working. Without document feeder we cannot copy legal size paper. This ghe major flaw I have faced using this printer otherwise ig is great.",2
Good product but connecting online with devices is bit of challenge. It appears apple devices synced very fast but windows taking time.,4
"Overall NOT Recommended.
-Dosent work with Phones
-Useless App doesn't work at all
-Scanner is not working, App Dose not Support.
Wasted loads of time make it work.
-Dead Slow Printing
-Does not work with Phones.",1
"Cons:Not worth the money. Problems with colour printing-sometimes it prints in grayscale. Driver needs to be reinstalled every time this issue occurs. There is no option to select colour and grayscale separately which means a colour document will always print in colour. It uses a lot of ink for colour prints. The power connector is loose.
Pros:ADF is a great feature reducing manual work.
Overall, if you do not need adf, you can always go for a cheaper model like 2621. HP as a brand is good and my previous model 2545 served for 7 years without many issues but this model certainly has its own problems and it is definitely overpriced.",3
"Printer is extremely slow even from Laptop via WIFI. It takes ages to print. Want to get it replaced or corrected.
Any help ? It does not respond at times and looks a complete waste of money.",1
"A great printer. Scans well, prints fast, works good online and offline. Connectivity options are best. The best part is the email id of the printer. We can send the documents via email directly to the personal email id of printer and it prints automatically.
The problem is with the direct wifi connection. Prints takes too much time or often fails to print incase of wifi direct connection.
Second thing which should be improved is the mobile app of the printer. App only shows some specific folders of internal storage. There is no option to find the documents stored in sd card memory. I can say app is a disaster while compared to printer functions.
And yes, i like the touch screen as well.",4
"Scanning via Auto Document Feeder scans random parts of the page. No solution from HP support till date. This is an inherent flaw in this model that HP knows about since many years and has still not fixed it. You can see several threads about this problem in the HP forums, just google it. Other than this issue it works fine",4
It's been exactly two months since I've purchased it... I'd not recommend it for colour prints since this really has too many issues. What I mean is that investment is really too high to what you get in return! Though I'd like to mention that the black and white print outs are Good and it is easy to install and use once you get it installed in all the aspects! I'd rather suggest everyone reading my review to invest in some ink tank printer cause it would be a one time investment and returns would be good!,3
"The printer is very good. Quality of print is nice. Installation is very easy as well. You will get lots of vedio in YouTube related to installation. One issue is that if you try to scan multiple documents at one go from top, the scanned pdf gets most of the images and data cropped. This issue is being reported by multiple user and whatever workaround given by HP didn't not work. So basically the multiple image scanning at one go functionality was not properly tested by HP before the product release. But if you are scanning individual document by opening the copier lid, it works fine.

Apart no other issue. Printer is awesome for home use.",4
"I get the order faster and then i used it for 2 days and 3rd days it's stoped working i don't know what's to do whether take it to hp care or return to get replacement .... I taken it to hp care .. after one week they handoverd it to me and again it's stoped working .....

In hp care they suggested me to DON'T BUY AT ONLINE . Because they have sample items ... Ugh worst ever ..",1
"After using the 3830 extensively, got this. The usual HP issues with the cartidges being short on ink and running out just when you need them the most is present in this as well. What peeved me the most was the intermittent and unreliable printing over direct Wi-Fi or over the home network. Perhaps it's my printer, or something else.

Why buy this? Document feeder for scanner. If you need to scan multiple pages, the document feeder is valuable feature.
Also, re-filled cartidges can be used if needed. Don't go with the rated prints, you'll get about 150-200 B&W pages on the regular 640 cartridge and 120-130 pages on the color.",4
"This works well... initial setup is not cumbersome...better to connect to a computer and do the setup i recommend from my experience.. firmware update is necessary to enable the scan feature(in my case ).. print quality is ok ok , print alignment is not that great,may get better later I think.. copy black and color both works fine, quality is also good...",4
"Cons and only cons
1. Gave print in Black and white, it is printing in color.
2. Too slow. Description mentioned 8 ppm for black white print. It is hardly 3 ppm.
3. Black cartridge got over with mere 60 prints.
4. HP Smart doesn't know what is happening to the printer.

I have to find a way to return this god-awful product.",1
"I purchased HP Deskjet 3835 All-in-One printer from Amazon 2 months ago and my review is based on my experience what I got from it.
Pros-I myself installed the product and I had no problem installing that as I got irritating people printed with manual.
Pages printing qualities superb and decent timing is taken to print a page.
It is good for home purposes.
(My opinion-you can go this for this printer it's good pages printing quality is also excellent .
It can scan copy fax its wireless also can use it through mobile also using its app available on play store).
@3999

Cons-ink is little bit getting drained.",5
"Really bad quality product from HP and pathetic support.

The paper gets jammed every time I try to print. (Se picture attached).
I contacted HP support, the support engineers came after a week. They initially said a part is faulty, but later didn't change it. They said its fixed no need to replace the part. In few days the paper jam issue started happening again.

Its really painful to contact, first they will make you talk to a bot. After 30 mins of chit chatting with the bot, if your session isn't timed out, you will receive the support phone number.",1
"Please change discription "" advantage "" to "" disadvantage"" . Worst experience I ever had , don't be trapped by this price features are good but when it comes to ink don't take a chance please. For 200 pages it costs 746/- , it would cost 100/- for 200 pages outside including A4 sheets .",1
Horrible printer! You cannot return but only exchange. It doesn't connect to wifi. There is zero tech support. Unable to print using wifi Direct. It is such a painful experience every time we need to use this printer. We have had HP printers earlier which worked fine. But this one is a dud. We asked for a return but they just exchanged it and this too is useless. Our money got totally wasted. HP should recall this product from the market.,1
"Printer is having a plastic cover and it's quality is top notch but the amount of paper it can print in a single ink cartridge is less about 50-60 pages in a single colour cartridge, it does have some type of connectivity problem if you are new to printers etc but it gets easier once you gets used to it, the only negative thing I can say about is it amount of paper that it can print and also double side printing is not possible in the double side printing. Rest if you are okay with the quantity of the papers it can print before it runs out ink then this printer is worth considering for casual use. But I consider it not suitable for the office use of bulk printing use.",3
"Dear friends,
Please do not buy this HP printer or any HP products..this has a defect after the first catrage finish..this would not recognise the new catrage....Amazon would not replace as by the time return window would close.. Post that you would have to run behind HP customer service.. and they have pathetic service it's been just 3 months my HP printer is dead and they refused to give me service as they claim I did something (this to avoid giving warranty).They said it has issue with mother borad and now it's more than one month..they didn't bother to call me or following...I fought with customers service for 3 days and found they rejected my claims. Atleast the person who visited me should have told me the issue or about warranty cannot be given...he just said mother bord need to be changed...now it's the time for free replace as per the policy..they just denied I did something...be careful before buying this you will loose your money Zero service.. headache and frustration...",1
"I am writing this review after a year old usage. Max 200 prints done but it suddenly stop working before a day.

It is showing carriage jam error. This is big drawback of the printer which HP isn't sharing anywhere. It is not repairable and because it is just one month above warranty. HP literally isn't providing any support.

When I went to market to get it repaired, all the printer repair shops shared one common notion HP printers aren't repairable, they don't provide any item parts unlike Epson which needs less repairs and if required parts are available in ample quantity.",1
"The printer is amazing. Installation is online and very easy. Print commands can be given from any device (android, windows, ipad) provided connected in the same network. It is Alexa compatible. You have to enable HP printer skill in Alexa and you are all set to print your shopping list, puzzles, games etc. Hp also gives a USB cable to connect to PC or laptop, just incase there is no network. The print quality is very good even in draft mode. Pre-programmed printables like check-list, ruled page, columns & rows etc. are available. Only con about this is the cost of the ink cartridge. Small pack (combo) itself costs around ₹2500.",5
"Review after
1. The ink fade away even if it's not in use for 10-12 days.
2. Printing is costlier.
3. Not worth for those who want to use it once or twice a month (I used it 3 times and took around 15 prints each time, 12 of them were B&W and 3 were Color), in total around 45 prints (specific because my Daughter's project was of 15 pages)).
4. At 3rd use, the Color ink completely fade away and B&W was available till last page BUT later that it didn't work and I have to buy new set of cartridges.
5. Final cost to me was like Rs. 26.66/- per page (cartridges price / papers printed Rs 1200 / 45 = 26.66 pp)",1
"The product images does not show that the paper feed tray is a pull out behind the printer. It projects out and gets in the way of putting a printer cover on it.
The printer goes offline quickly and the drivers need to reconnect. Because of this the whole process of printing a document of scanning takes time.
It works better if it is connected via USB rather than on WiFi.",2
"Not at all satisfied in terms of printer cartridge. Not more than 30 pages I printed and black cartridge is finished. Colour cartridge is also near to finish. Moreover, even if paper is loaded, printer sensor is not able to detect the same and ask for loading the paper.",1
"Purchased this product over a month ago, during the last sale. The produce was well packaged and delivered promptly. Installation took a while, especially if you don't have a CD-drive and have to install from the web. After installation thought, it is very easy to use. However, after a month's use and about 35 pages of print, the laptop stopped color prints while color prints from the mobile gave yellow printouts.
The customer service was the worst, even after over an hour of staying on calls, they werent able to solve either of the issues. I was able to solve the laptop issue by reinstalling all drivers manually, which took some time. A complaint was finally raised to send a technician for a site visit. The tech person came after a couple of days, tried the same steps but couldn't solve. Per the technician, the red color nozzle had dried out and this is common in inkjet printers if not used every 3 days!!",2
"After a thorough search I chose this one for small e-mitr service work. It's already been 5 months and have used every feature of this printer and hence following are my points;
1. At this price, the printer is very much efficient and reasonable
2.Quality and service is very good
3. The printing cost is slightly more than I expected and mentioned on paper
4. Easy to install and till date no issue is being found in terms of it's functioning",4
"Wireless connectivity with Laptop is a big issue. After 3 days also I could not connect it to my Sony Laptop. My laptop shows the printer, but printer is not functioning wireless even after connection. Rest other functions are good. For Print quality I can give 7 out of 10 points, because I have used HP printer before this also of lower price range the print quality was more crispe, may be it is because of paper we use. But overall a good printer",4
"Horrible product. It did not work at all. The paper pickup failed.
The product looked like it has been pre-used. The cable included in the box had paint spots on it. It was also just loosely kept in the box without any packing. There was no manual or any literature included in the box. The box looked badly worn out. The print cartridges were pre-installed. They were already half used.
The printer did not looked new from any angle!

Called Amazon. They said there is no replacement available and therefore they will refund the entire amount.

Zero stars for the product. Zero stars for resellers. 5 stars for Amazon help.

I would suggest not to buy a printer from Amazon and particularly from this reseller.",1
"Paper flow/jam issue since April 2020 ... impossible to get HP support despite purchase of 2 year on-site support, and lockdown finishing ... waste of money.
P.S. - I bought 2 printers. One working fine... the second one failed within first year (less than 50 pages overall printing in 6 months) ... and NO support forthcoming from HP ... despite purchase of additional extended warranty!",1
"Ordered at 9pm and printer got delivered at 2pm next day. Super fast Amazon delivery.

Print quality is top notch, easy to setup, light weight. Price of 7400 looks a bit on higher side but hope it's worth in long run of usage.

Good for home use, child projects etc",5
"Have never came across such problematic printer...It feels like it likes to throw variety of errors.....At first it failed to recognize setup cartridge (that came along with printer). I had to replace the printer. The replacement piece that came in worked extremely week for first 4-5 days. Then after printing 1st page of the file, it starts throwing in error of 'Paper Mismatch' every single time...I mean almost printer uses A4 sheet and I know where do I need to change the page size ....I changed page sizes everywhere and then I realized its only accepting A5 size... After 2 days session with HP support and Amazon customer care where they made me go through what not change in settings ..I gave up and thanks to Amazon they agreed to refund the money.

Never going to buy HP printer again...",1
The printer is very unreliable. It keeps giving error message all the time. Inserting paper isn’t easy at all and you get it only after multiple trials. On an average it gives 20 error messages per print. I am going to return this printer after trying to use it for 2 months,1
"Pros:
1) Print quality is good
2)Scanning is easy and Xerox is also good
3) User friendly functions
4) Good for Home use, when you only have to print in less quantity

Cons:
1) Constantly facing problems with wifi, direct wifi and its all so complicated. Installed an app in mobile the 1st day, everything was fine. Next day it keeps showing ""Driver unavailable""
2) It took 3 days to install in Computer.
3) User manual is not useful. it hardly says anything there

Getting it installed in ur mob and computer right is the key..else its a headache",4
"Randomly throws error when printing from computer(wirelessly).
Even with papers/cartridge present, orange led, probably an error state gets displayed quite often.
I still manage to get prints but not a good experience.",1
"Since I after buying it I feel some one need who is expert but since even then I got to know how the twin side printing is from social media like YouTube but product will goes on performance is awesome and other thing is to mention that I saw user manual is printed little bit in English and most used language is in some other language

Hethere again i am chetan and as i need to tell you is this printer has came with no defect but i need to cum to know is about its catridge is only about to 17-20mls of ink hence it does took a 10-20 days to get empty and its price is too costly is 850/- to 950/- each for each which contains 20ml only so then its too costly and you get 43-55rupees for each 'ml' of in in catridge else quite ""GOOD"" product manifacturers done 'GOOD' efforts and taken 'NO COMPROMISE' with 'Quality' any how you can goto official site to get proper tutorials
Thanks for reading my comment and i wish it made good review to make good decision",5
"Hp3835 is good printer for occassionally printing requirement. Ink consumption is very high than comitted. Also ink gets dry if printer is kept idle for a week time. Cost of ink cartidge ranges from 1200-1600 Rs. Montly consumtion 1600 ~2800 Rs. Overall costlier affair to buy this printer. Photo print is good, but you have to use photo paper like kodak glossy paper. If your requirement of print is higher then I will recommend B&W HP 1020. Its excellent and cheap print cost. This printer cannot work with refilled cartidges.",2
WiFi set up is a great pain. Whole lot of settings you have to do. And printer still does not print documents from your mobile application. Don't know what is the issue. You tube videos of Hp it self does not help. Printer behaves some thing else then shown in video.,1
"Overall a good printer for small day to day printing, what I didn’t like was it takes 2 pages together while printing one page, so I have to hold the second page and then leave it later, would get very difficult if a large printing job needs to be done",4
Don't buy this,1
"Had a lot of questions/worries at time of purchasing this all-in-1 printer. Surprisingly all questions were answered at time of installing this printer self.
Able to install cartridges.
Able to install/connect to wifi.
Able to setup through mobile, laptop.
Able to update software easily.

Hope printer will sustain as per this",5
Printer is awesome. Good quality pictures and printing speed is normal. Can print from mobiles is a good feature. Some cons are like scanning in default resolution is not of good quality. ADF scanning sometimes faulty. Flatbed scanning is good. Packing by the seller not upto mark. No Amazon prime packaging.,5
"Wirless printer scan doesn't work from smartphone (HP smart app) and that's their selling point.

""Modern mobile multitasking"" - Print, scan and sent a fax from your phone with HP smart app.

Really ? Misleading users with incorrect feature listing.",1
"Not working product, called for return, Amazon has all time promises to return but return still pending where as4 to 5 times call customer care center, please don't purchase such items from Amazon, flip cart is best for big electronic product the have good and fast return and refund",1
"i am writing this review after using the printer for 6 months.. this is one of the worst printers i have ever used.. firstly the printer is super slow.. the print quality is not good... Laserjet printers are faster and has much better quality prints than these.. also this printer doesnt have duplex... even manual duplex is super complex... the printer has stopped working now for the second time. first time it was some error in the print ribbon.. i somehow figured it, cleaned it up and it started workin again... now it says paper jam.. i dont see any paper jam... lord only knows how it gets these error triggers.. i am gonna book a service person and lets see how it goes.. but overall i am not happy with the purchase..",2
It's cartridge is small and expensive which even cost more than normal print from shop it can be used in emergency only otherwise buying it is not a profitable deal,3
"Poor performance, very difficult to setup on laptop required 10 different drivers. Page continuously jamming, even i am not abel to print single pages, serial number not recognised by online website, even online supprt team not abel to solve issue, product returned.",1
"Very disappointed with ink performance, I have printed 80 odd sheets 95% of it in black and white few pages mostly text with company logo printed in color but the colour cartridge has come down to less than 30%. Worst part is it is very difficult to get in touch with HP customer support this is my second experience with HP previously a laptop now a printer.",1
This is an excellent all-in-one printer. Looks stunning and works seamlessly with wifi. Only issue I found is the adf does not have paper aligner hence sometimes the paper gets fed distortedly. On the whole fantastic printer.,4
"@HPIndia bought HP printer in June. With home use it broke down. HP Ref Num: 5054565929 after 3 days of follow-up. Case closed directly by service center. without any action.
Issue- paper feed not detecting paper. All trouble shooting steps from HP completed. Worthless products.",1
Upto now everything seems fine. Don't buy new hp 680 cartridges. When the given catridges go down below the half limit refill them.. Check YouTube about the procedure... Best cost effect way. If you buy new cartridges after every use... Then it is utterly useless... Because both the cartridges equate to about Rs1100...and they yield a Max of 150 black and colour about 90-100. With my past experience canon image class all in one printers are best if you have money to spend... But if you are on a budget there ain't a better option for small offices and home. Hope this prompts you buy this class product from HP.,5
"Works well for home requirements of printing . For two side printing, you need to do two parse. It seems a botheration at first, but i prefer it because it has lesser mechanical parts and hence more robust. Had a printer before with printing on both sides, where that mechanics involved in reverse side printing didn't work.

Apart from that, it is a breeze to work with.",5
"I was pretty satisfied with the product untill it stopped printing the colored print outs all of a sudden. I tried the automated cartridge clean option as well but to no avail. Below are a few pros and cons of the product:

Pros:

Elegant look
Easy to Install
A handy touch pad
Print quality is quite good

Cons

May stop printing colored or black&white prints
Prints get stuck at times and need to be pulled out
Incomplete prints on the print out occasionally",3
"1 Printer Cartridge will print ~80-100 pages(one side only) only and that too when we took print in Economic mode, Plus if you try any hack to refill cartridge...It would not work at all. Every time you have to buy cartridge of Rs. 650-750 range... If u r ready to spend Rs. 8-10 per page(single side) you can go for it. They are earning money by selling highly priced cartridges and low cost printers...It is a trap..

Don't buy, our most regretted shopping ever.

"The Power cord is loose. I have received this item within 7 days and waiting for installation by device provider. After contacting with customer care I have informed that there is no available of installation device and it will be installed by me.
As per the Instruction I have installed the device with maintaining all the criteria but after so many times to try to installed the same properly, I have failed to installed the item. The device massage has come Turn off and then turn on. But the result is same and not working for next step.

"While the printer was easy to setup using the cable and print, and the print quality was very good, the wireless printing setup wasn't easy. I wish that was a made a lot simpler as well.

With in 20 days, seriously!!! Please check the warranty information when you recieve this product itself. I am not able to call any helpdesk and no one is there it help... Pathetic experience...",1
Very good printer at such cost by hp but the ink is somewhat costly as per printing cost.also if printer is not used for some days then paper jams occur.,4
"The printer is great and setting up was easy.

Below are my observations.

- User interface is easy and setup process was seamless. There are some niche features like printing rule pages, mazes,sudoku etc.

-The best part is I can print from any corner of the world with internet connection, This printer has lot of connectivity features USB ,WIFI Direct, printing from phone with HP print assistant app.

- I got the printer replaced as the magenta or red colour was not printing ,I even got a print quality report out but the red pigment was missing.

-Replacement printer did not include the ethernet cable, the box contents also showed no ethernet cable but the earlier one had one in the box and on the box contents label.

-The replacement printer paper spooler does not spool paper sometimes even though there are enough papers. i have to deliberately apply little pressure on the paper bunch in the printer and yes I am using Colorlok papers HP recommends. Printing lot of pages overnight does not seem possible , I have to keep an eye for load paper message even with about 25 pages. Though there is quiet mode which reduces print speed.

Hope you find this review helpful.",4
"Complete and utter garbage.

The feed 'tray' for paper is non existent. Its just a slot - that is too small - through which you stick in a few papers at a time. You will be lucky to print a page or two out of this craptastic piece of junk before it jams.

Ofc - too late to return it. Will need to figure out how to dispose the darn thing. Will donate it to anyone that needs a scanner. Printing and copying of course are out of the question.

HP - you suck and I hate you!",1
Printer is easy to install and easy to use. B&W prints are quick but it takes quite long time of around ~10 mints for colour prints. Print quality of colour print is not up to the expectations as compared to B&W print quality. Colour Cartridge was also not full tank when received with printer.,3
Received yesterday...very easy to install.. easy to use....in all respects too good...except cartridge quality..not superb and as per photo printing the consumption is so poor.I have printed only 4 Pics A4 size the colour cartridge is finished...I have to buy today....very very expensive.,4
"Hahahah, you got printer at cheap price but the whole game is about ink. After 2 - 3 color print ink cartridges level is just half. Work nice with black cartridge, but definitely not to use color print overall okay to buy if you are a student. It'll manage your time, but you'll not happy with ink price price.",4
"The printer can be operated wireless from your phone as well as laptop. In Linux, the printer was auto-detected as it was in the same network and I was able to use it. The installation steps are pretty easy to follow through. The print quality is good, almost natural. The scanning and I'd scan facility is pretty good. Only downfall is that for two sided printing you will have to feed the odd sided printed papers once more. Other than that I believe it is a good printer for the the price.
My parents found the UI pretty simple to use and I am happy for that as well.",5
"It's a good choice for home usage and printing less quantity of prints..
Though it doesn't seem economical as the printer cartridge cost to number of prints it gives.. we hardly printed 100prints but the cartridge is about to finish.
Other than that rest all features wise it is of great use..",4
"Document Feeder is getting jamed. It is not functioning properly. Had to contact customer service, no idea during this pandemic, service will be an hectic and pathetic. Let's see. Rests are okay.",3
"Does all the job wirelessly,fast printing , initial setting up of drivers is easy,very light and compact,quite easy to handle,overall a good multifunctional printer,this printer is an upgrade to hp 4729, added ADF

"It's amazing except the fact that it's too huge for the functionality.
Automatic document feeder is a nice assistance in making copies

HP allows you to connect to a router and they could let you setup a email address where you can send your PDFs and it will print automatically from the server !
Always use HP original cartridge for Best Print Quality!",5

"Useless after first 100 prints. Catridges are very expensive. Per print costs more than Rs.20/-. It says 400+ prints, but in actual only 100-150 prints we can get.
Not a pratical thing.",1
"For wireless printing 4178 is good option with adf feature. Specially Direct-WiFi (no wifi router needed) feature is very good & most convenient.
Only con is color printing as its not yeild the no.of prints as they mentioned in specs. Only black&white yeilds good as mentioned. When compared to 4123, this 4178 comes with 682 cartridge(twice the no.of prints to 805 cartridge)",4
"Print quality is awesome. Initially I was afraid by reading the reviews but the bad reviews are wrong one... I have uploaded the image of print,look at it and it is when quality is set at medium, which means if i set best it would better than the uploaded image, have a look at it and you will know the real fact. Again the scanning is also awesome and copying is as same as the print i.e. Xerox is similar to original print. Awesome printer overall. Easy to install and use. Best choice for home and small businesses. Consumes less ink and gives best print.",5
All Hp products are Made in China. Print and build quality is good. It is overpriced when compared to Hp’s online site. U can’t it from there at ₹6700/-. I purchased as was not available there and was in need.,4

Cons:-
1. Not ideal for business as the ink cost is bit higher for one print.",5
I just got printer on 6 Feb and on 7 Feb it began to hang and when I first unboxed it it seem to be used with having scratches but I ignored it the next day when the problem came I gone to check warranty at HP which showed me that 8 month warranty left so what we can understand from this I received on 6 Feb 2020 and warranty left is 8 month,3
"The print quality is great & it's very easy to use and also install. But unfortunately, the no.of pages printed are not as mentioned in the product description i.e., ~480 pages (Black & White), 150 pages (Colour) - ISO standards this is a great disappointment for me. Other than that rest all is great.

Is there any way to reduce the color percentage on the printer (HP DeskJet 3835)?",3
"Easy to install and use within 10 minutes. Works seamlessly with the app on the phone.
On the laptop, I have had issues using the network or wifi but it works perfectly fine using the cord that comes with the printer. Suggestion is to use a printer cover to keep it free off dust and make it long lasting.
Been using it for 2 months now, and no complaints.",5
"Got a used printer in first delivery. It was missing CD and RJ45 cable in the package. It also had printing issues. Replaced it and the new one seems to be brand new. Working fine so far....
Print quality is good. Easy to use. HP Smart app is good",4
Very very bad installation of WiFi is soooooo difficult - actually impossible On apple devices I have been trying for the last 3 days and now returning this printer :( needed the WiFi to work well for office use at home - horrible pls don’t buy the is printer,1
"nice product but ink finishes so early i guess in every printer it finishes 😅 its a good product .but not worth it . Never works properly and service is the worst never pick up the call , it's an expensive thing so it should work properly",5
"I like the design, ease of installation and interface.

What I don't like at all is that it is like ink guzzler, not even 20 prints and cartridge is required to be replaced

Very very expensive in terms of running cost.",1
"Installation is not easy for general user. Printing is very slow.
Paper puller has issues as when printing it pulls entire bunch loaded so single sheet feeding is cumbersome",5
extremely handy product. Everything is easy and quality is superb. All good only thing am missing both side print in an automated way. Which is not possible at this price but can manage the same manually. Am happy with the product.,5
"I am facing following issue after printer delivery
1. It’s cartridge is exhausted too early , max after 75 prints that too mostly black white
2. The paper has started Jamming too much while printing , & destroying papers
3. Connectivity to computer is difficult to establish even after wire , don’t tell me my laptop has issue it is one of the best Microsoft surface pro

Finally from last couple of weeks I have stopped using it , I request amazon to get it picked",1
"Got the printer in well packed condition and on time.

Print Quality is good,
Easy to install and use,
You can directly print from the mobile via wifi or use the app.
Printing speed is not very fast but ok for home use.
Its coloured photo printing quality is good but ink level decreases very fast when you give a large or too many colour prints.
Overall good printer for personal use.",4
If you buy this printer for just printing then its fine but if you're trying to buy this for scanning then this is not for you. If you scan color documents the result is very bad and inaccurate. The color xerox gives very bad results. Thanks to Amazon they help me return the product.,2
"Received a Defective Non working Unit, i buy from amazon alot and for the 1st time i have faced such issue where the printer didn't even turn on, Shame on you guys to have sent me a non working unit, it was for my sons homework durint pandemic.",1
HP engr. couldn't install printer on my PC with Windows 7 operating system. Product description stated printer compatibility with Windows 7 &10. Thus the product to returned.,1
"Maintainance cost is too much....refill cartridges are getting exhausted in just few days irrespective of the usage....for better quality should print using usb cable...wireless printing quality is not upto the mark. Printer cost is less but Maintainance coat is very high.
I'm going to sell it in olx now.",1
"This printer is slow and doesn't detect cartridge. Had a hard time using it,works only once in while even that with a hard luck, overall waste of money. Want to return or replace",1
"This is a great product. It allows me to print from internet and mobile over wireless, has excellent print quality, very easy to use, install and troubleshoot for small problems, lastly has the ability to scan and xerox multiple pages with one click",5
Print quality is good but cartridge quality is very poor. My cartridge is over and i didn't take even 50 prints. Print cost is very high as cartridge cost is around 2000 INR. Don't buy else loose money.,1
"Printing cost is too high and scanner doesn't work. The HP Print and scan doctor hangs and never works. When trying to call HP support, they just keep on collecting data without meaningful help. They asked my number so that they could call back in case of call drop, but they never callback, seems the entire effort was on data collection.
I wasted almost 4-5 hours in getting this fixed but nothing helps.
So, if you want peace of mind, refrain from buying this product.
I have been using Epson printers from last 4-5 years with a much better support.",1
"If you use it for color printing, the cost per paper goes more than 50 Rs.
Simply means you pay for printer, then pay for ink. Don't think using syringe won't be of much help.

Think and buy. This is hopeless product",1
"Printer is good and worth the money. But the vendor isn’t good. The invoice which was issued with my purchase had wrong serial no. Printed, so I could not claim the offer from HP for free earphone. After calling Amazon for it also they are not able to provide the correct invoice even after 10 days of complain. This decreases the trust in Amazon.",4
"If you are buying this product please ensure you are tech minted, Installing HP smart app from the windows store is somewhat difficult because if you're nor using Original O.S you can't download the HP app but overall print quality is good, the major advantage is you can perform Multifunction",3
HP Deskjet Ink Efficient 4178 WiFi Colour Printer is awesome. Very easy to install WiFi as well as wired connection with desktop & mobile. Hardly 10 minutes time needed to do this installation. One of the best Printer in this price range. Must buy product.,5
"my printer is not working ..initial 15 days worked only for Xerox and pRinting. complained to Hp but they said it's not working due to blank cartridge , new cartridge completed only after 50-60 prints. But after refilling printer is not still working.",1
The paper doesnt reverse by itself when you do a 2 sided print. Its a pain to have to get up & remove it & refeed it from the top. Otherwise it's a good printed thought a bit bulky by today's standards.,4
"Worst printer in the market right now..
Its much easier to visit a photocopy place near your house to get a print out, then to use this printer..
I don't know what the brand was thinking making a printer this complicated for the users.",1
"A neat and well-designed product. Installation and setup were easy. USB cable and phone cable are included. Software is user friendly. Good print quality and scan quality. I found it to be an excellent product for my home use. Overall happy with the purchase.

It comes with trial ink cartridges that last less than regular ink cartridges.",5
"I printed 5 color A4 photos and ink is over. Wtf
This is scam from HP.. Be aware and don't buy this product",1
"My personal advice please don't buy this product very poor quality..as as well as very very bad customer service (HP care Wipro limited ,c/o skypro technologies Pvt .Ltd flat No 29 ,door No8,3rd cross ,sithanandha Nager,Ellaipillaichavady,pondy-605005 )only one month I use this printer after some motor wire cut I said I have warranty one year .the service centre said some Cockroach go inside cut the wire ..fully cheating .. please don't go this product mainly thiruvannamalai District people .. because you will also get same service centre ..they are cheating.. service engineer name( Dinesh)",1
"The printer not able to connect windows 7 machine and they didn't provide driver dvd or no url for download driver software for printer. hp customer care service is not resolving this issue and waste.
Color printing they mention 150 pages for printing but it is coming only 100 pages. it is very worst product.",1
"Great product, The item was delivered quickly, and it was easy to set up. The 'e-mail to print"" function is great and it allows me to print documents at home from anywhere in the world. Great for a home office setup, with its scanning and printing function.",5
"Easy to install. Easy to use. A must-have machine.
Just 1 problem. Scanning over WiFi/network doesn't work on Windows platform. Surprisingly, scanning over WiFi/network works on Android platform.",4
This does not support double side printing. We need to first print odd pages then turn around the pages for printing even pages. This is a basic feature to have in printer that is over 8k,2
"Can print approx 300 pages with the ink cartridge provided along with package...just need to take care of paper availability...coz it may get stuck and show error...if there is inadequate papers for the print given.
Overall good printer...",4
"The printing speed is slow.
The ADF scans only up to A4 size page while I had thought it could do a bigger page as well.

Other than the above, the printer is quick to install and set up. It boots fast and takes command over wifi from the phone seamlessly.",4
"I have had a serious scanning problem with this printer. Some scanned pages come out skewed or tilted, with HP Printer Assistant software which comes on the CD. HP have replaced it once but the same problem turned up on the other. HP are discussing the next action.

Printing and copying are clear, with no problem",1
"Friends,
I'm Utpal Mandal telling you that, you can buy HP Deskjet 3835 All-In-One Printer to close the eye. I personally say that after using this, there are no any better printers are available in the market comparative this product. This is too cheap also. I think if you already purchased any product from Amazon then you definitely known that Amazon's service is the best. Thank you ""HP"" Company and also thank you to ""Amazon""",5
color cartridge quantity reduced to half upon printing just 3 color photos of post-card size!!!,3
One of the main reasons for buying the product was the wireless printing feature... Wireless printing is extremely slow and sometimes takes 15-20 minutes to print. Sometimes only half of the pages just get printed. Print quality is pretty good. It has some good features too. Buy this if only if HP fixes the slow printing issue.,1
"There is no ink advantage ...uses a lot of ink..soaks paper..u can't use a highlighter to highlight the text..the print will come off
.HP Software doesn't install in macbook...spend a few bucks more and get a laserjet",2
"1. some times taking 2 pages for scanning,
2. poor scanning quality
3. in feeder mode, paper not scanned fully, half page scanning and remaining page white coming.",2
"Have been using for about a month... Good printer, but strangely colour is printing as b/w. Have looked at the settings and not finding any options.

Print quality is good, and options and great. Scan works well.",4
"I am facing a lot of problems with the machine. Initially it was the scanner which was not scanning multiple papers, reason for which I bought it. Now the touch panel does not work. It keeps on asking for day date and time update. The HP technician visited today and said the touch panel need replacement. Thankfully it is under warranty. I have used HP printers always since 1997 but this one is testing my patience.",1
"The catridge which comes with the printer has very low ink and I was advised to refill as the company gives low ink for testing purpose only...
Even when i refil i can take only 50-60 copies and i refilled 4 times in a month",2
"Very user friendly, easy to install and use. Bought it for my 12 year old child for school assignments n projects. He uses it himself with ease and it serves the purpose for home printing, scanning and photocopying.",5
"As usual, one needs to install lot of bloated HP apps on your phone to get this to work with WIFI.

I am surprised why HP cannot use Android's inbuilt functionality and provide a single light weight app for wireless printing.",4
The printer had paper jams from time of install. It jams spedially if you cancel a print midway. Also Amazon refused to return the printer even with problem on day one asking me to approach HP for warranty. Lost my trust. Strongly recommended not to buy,1
"The Printer has stopped working and I am unable to Print/Scan any Documents
I have written to the Seller ""Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd at their Ahmedabad Address and sent a copy to their registered office in Pune. Both Letters were sent by Speed Post and I am still to hear from the seller

Kindly look into this and have the printer repaired/replaced",1
"Installation of printer was good and easy going. Print,copy and scan activities all working good. Cartridge installation is easy, only worried about how many pages will it last. Wireless configuration done with my smart phone.
Well I give 5stars on this.
Can someone provide a HP printer service center number and address for my other HP printer?",5
This is not fair from a company like HP to cheet the customers by providing substandard ink cartridges. The cartridges gave me only 5 prints and this bitter experience restrained me from buying more cartridges and the printer is kept idle since then. I request you to send good cartridges at the earliest.,3
It is easy to use but the ink cartridge are costly... It is quite big... Works well... No issues yet... Connect well with laptops and systems...,5
"Absolutely not easy to install a printer. Not able to connect via wifi to laptops.
Ink cartridges are half in just 20 prints.

A wrong decision to buy this printer. Moreover not a single call or a visit from the HP engineer to help us install this.

Shame on HP",1
Product is defective only prints 1/4th of page. I returned it with in 5days but no return has done. It shows now return window close. HP customer service is so poor that they haven't attended.,1
Dont buy such products online...they will give you the product whose warranty is going to be ended soon plus you have to install it on your own which is quite difficult... Instead you can choose your local dealer to get such products,2
"Writing this review after 2 month usage
Simple setup
Easy Usage
No wires required... wireless with WiFi connect features
I feel worth buying as my kids operate it easily as per their needs.. scan, print and copy .. all good
You just need to take care well from dust..!!! Overall worth buying I guess.",4
Overall a good multi function printer except for the ADF. Printing and scanning work very well. Scanning via the sheet feeder has problems. About a third of the time some pages come only partially scanned. I have other HP printers that don't have this problem. Very annoying as the ADF is a key reason I got this printer.,3
"I suggest to buy this printer.
It is cheap and is multi functioned.
It has an automatic document feeder for scanner.
and it also use one of the cheapest ink cartridge.
only duplex printing is not there, who cares.
Just it's ""AWESOME"".",5

@HPIndia pathetic after sales service. Should never buy HP products. 2 months since new printer not working and no service visit as yet despite warranty. Don't buy HP products,2
"Pls buy inktank printer because once ink finished , you have to buy another cartridge which felt Rs.1400 combo , you may guess 1400x 12 month , sure i got it at Rs 6500 but now i am completely disappointed . Do late your deal but by once costlier printer which may give you less printing cost. Thank you .",3
Good product for home use. Easy to install even 6 year child can do. Hp made it so easy to use. I am using for 1 month and the printing qulity is average. But very usefull for school going student. Amazon is always best for their on time delivery.,3
One of the most sleek printers out there that has every feature in the printer book (including ADF). Super easy to set up and use. The HP eSmart feature is pretty cool as well. Go for it!,5
Would not say the best but this is good for the price it comes for. This solves household purpose printing needs. If you are looking for fancy requirements do check other products but for a regular person at home you need to manually set few things,4
Useless product wrong info provided.its a useless printer with high running cost..the cartridge has been exhausted in just 30 prints...can you own up and change the printer else will not buy anything from Amazon site...you have given misleading information about the product...,1

"Easy to install. It automatically detect the paper,it's a good feature and also has all the features.
previously I bought a HP DeskJet 7275 printer it was the baddest printer on Amazon
It's been 10 working fine for now.",3
Print quality is above average. And easy to install. It has quite mode which I liked. Scan quality also good. School students can use this printer for their project work.,4
Easy to install & operate. User friendly.,5
The print quality is ok ok. When you make a Xerox copy it's working nice but print quality is very poor. The screen touch also doesn't work properly. I think it was my worst purchase from Amazon. If you are a long term person never buy this. It would prove to be your worst investment.,2
Great small printer. Connectivity over wifi functionality is built for Apple products. For Android need to download add-in. Which doesn't work instantly and takes a while to connect to the printer.,4
"Hopeless, cleaned and aligned the cartridges yet the copy functionality is hopeless, tried printing pan card and the entire page turned black, don't purchase it, look for other options. And also the printer seems very slow.",1
"Great product, works like a dream. The cartridge is slightly expensive but worth the money. If you print around 20 pages per day, this is the printer, wish the refill was a little cheaper",5
Heavy on ink consumption. Only black cartridge case close to 800 Rs hardly you get 50 pages on intermittent printing.,3
"Best printer ever even higher priced printers can’t match its quality my experience has gone very great
Print quality is very accurate and doesn’t take to much time
Build quality is very great
The only problem with it is that the ink depletes out too fast
Overall the printer can be given a 5 star rating",5
An absolutely amazing printer! The best printer with all facilities provided! It has a touch screen and is very easy to install (can checkout any YouTube video for installation as well). This is truly a smart printer. I have tried many printers but this one is seriy worth every penny. No need to second guess this one.,5
Don't bye this for Xerox print cost 1.5 per pages,1
"I have purchased this printer on 20 May 2020.I purchased this product to print coloured picture. Hp says it can print upto 50 picture . But this printer can print only 10 coloured picture and after that it got empty.
What's the use of this printer if this can print only 10 papers??
Really very disgust and embracing...",4
"This makes my life easy , easy to print anything from mobile and scanning also pretty good .
And xerox also good overall product is worth for me and by the way it looks more stylish on my desk",5
"I have never seen such a trash printer which is so-called ""wireless"". Half the time the printer disconnects on its own and reconnecting it is a great hassle. The print quality is not worth the cumbersome and tiring connecting procedure. It is better to save your money and go for a wired printer.",1
"Print quality is average. Blak print on normal paper is good. But If you colour print on photo paper, ink quality is too bad... it didn't fill the margins completely finishing is bad... and ink will spreads if you touches the print.",3

Never buy this Printer. After months of use I found this to be ink guggler and print quality is poor and ink catridge is quite expensive. HP should immediately discontinue this product. Not recommended buy.,2
This printer is a budget printer under 7k. It is very easy to setup and handle. Print quality is excellent. Inbuilt document feeder is very helpful to copy a document. The option quiet mode is allows the printer to work at a very low noise. The printer build quality is excellent. Thank you HP for manufacturing this printer. I am totally satisfied with this printer.,5

Pls request to all don't waist ur money.",1
The original cartridge that came with the printer did not last not even for 8-10 pages of color! Worst printer and I would like HP to either update their description or get this product out os sale! Worst Buy,1
Poor print quality. Cartridge life is a scam. The colour cartridge was left 10% only after 24 page of moderate could pages. What a shame HP. Worst buy ever. Not at all good for photo printing,1
"My favorite feature is the available in built samples like,a reminder with one or two columns,soduku,weekly or monthly calendars,Music Notation Sheet,so so much more...",5
It been six months that i am using the printer. The printer consumes a lot of ink. I have changed the cartridge thrice in 6 months ! with regular printing for home use .. the HP original cartridge is also quite expensive,1
"I had some issue in scan and copy, tried to return the product, but there is no option for returning. I spoke to customer care executive, who told me that the item will be replaced within 48 hours, but no one came to collect the item.

But overall functional is good.",4
The product was very difficult to install. The person who was meant to come and install never came I have a lot of problems printing and have to uninstall and install the printer,2
I experienced same issue faced by many other reviewers. It just won't print color no matter what settings or devices you try. Total waste and I am returning this. Do not watse your time and money on this useless product. Never expected this from a reputed brand like HP.,1

"Wonderfull printer
I felt like the ink dried up quickly but thats probably because I used it a lot.....

A very good printer. very good printing quality.easy to print wirelessly through phone or tablet.no wi-fi modem required for wireless printing.very easy to install and no need for a professional person.,5

Printer is very good but cartridge received with printer is finished too early. Color cartridge about only 10 to 15 pages and black & white about 50 pages.,4
The print quality is very nice. It is very easy to use and met our expectations. It easy to install and can print from any where,5
Nice all in one printer with lots of functions. Print quality is good. Little bulkier because of Automatic Document Feeder.,4
"For a layperson, set-up and use gets a bit difficult at times, unlike older models which were straightforward",5

This Printer has best in quality print in range but quantity of printing in a single Cartridge is very less in comparison to Ink tank printer. Otherwise this Printer having best performance,4
I'm super happy with the product.... Very good quality and so easy to use.. Seamlessly print via app in android phone,5
"Difficulty in installation. Please give me a person to install.
Got a professional to install it. Now I have to see whether it prints 100 copies as promised.",1
"The best in that range, been using for 5 months, works great, hassle free and very very easy to use, with the HP Smart app , you use the printer from mobile",5
"Best in class. Easy-to-use. Pocket friendly.
Best thing is when you are away you can print remotely via the email id that hp will generate.",5

And very fast delivered by Amazon.",5
Paper jamming issue,4
"We have taken photo ,print,scanning,Xerox. Quality wise good",5
Very Disappointed with the cartridge capacity. Just bought the printer a week back and put the NEW cartridges which came along with it. In less than 50 prints it says ink low. Very unhappy with this,1
"Please do not buy.. les than 100 b&w prints and the ink is out.. not expected from a brand like HP.
Am stuck with this printer now.. in 5 months the cost of the cartridge is more the cost of the printer itself.",1
"It's not worth for rare users..
Simply waste of money.. Cartridge is very costly..
Printing through wifi is horrible..
HP app is not user friendly..",2
Good printer with print quality and wifi operation but consumes more ink cartridges.,5
"Display is not working properly, black colour is getting faded on photos",3
The cartridges were semi filled..the coloured one got finished after few prints. I guess this is done to reduce the cost to the company...not acceptable for a renowned company like HP. The colour prints eat up your cartridges..no way an ink advantage printer...,2
Ink is the main problem here it doesn't print even 70pages but the print quality is very good it's mainly for home and small businesses use only not suits for even medium size businesses with daily 5 printout,4
"Prints and photo copies are very different from original. The Blue colour in original is printed as light black.
The ink also spreads often.",3
"after 3 months of domestic use (i used very rarely. 8-10 pages per week), its printing time is 3mins/page -black&white. total waste of money. soon i ll upload printing video on youtube.",1
"Just a average All on one, not reliable for printing.
the ADF feature for scanning was the reason for purchase",3
only challenge was wifi scanner 2nd page on wards bit issue,3
Very good and as expected....for home.purpose this one is the budgeted WiFi all-in-one...easy to Install and easy to handle.,4
"Received defective one and worst service by HP....
worst product...

Product is replaced as page struck in earlier one bt now color cartiage is not printing well. Very dull printing. Now thinking to return & Shop directly from market after every verification. Pathetic. You can see print quality in pics.,2
Very easy to install & oprtate. Found pretty user friendly being a non tech savy person,5
"Printer is giving problems from the start. Page intake has a problem (need manual intervention). While printing in Grayscale, its printing in pink color. Horrible experience.",1
"In less than a year the paper feeder has stopped working. It doesn't sense or pull in the paper properly. Can't put more than 1 sheet, else it will take multiple. Need to push the paper a few times before it takes it.",3
Buy only if you're ready to spend 6-7 Rs Per Page... Didn't expect this piece of Crap From HP.,1
Good for home usage and small quantity. B&W prints are good.,4
Good print quality and value for money. The software is easy to install and it it Works perfectly with MacBook.,5
"Whenever we receive a printer, it's INSTALLATION CD is must inside the product box but it was missing, twice and the FAX wire which has to be there was also missing Twice..........",4
"Cartridges are not good, colour one print a few prints and it is difficult to refill bcz after 2 or 3 time refill the cartridges pins crash",3
"But Page print quantity is very less. In half packet papers I have refilled the ink two times and in third time now I have to buy new ink bottle s which cost around 1200/-. In this way per page print price is very véry very high, which is very difficult to afford",1
"This one is the best for this price range.

Pros

2. Good Printing
3. Wifi connectivity, Touch Screen

Cons
No cash on delivery option available.",5

Great product. The print quality is good and it is value for money product.,5
Perfect for home use. This was suggested to me by one of friend and i found it is very handy and easy to use. More of it is value for money. I have suggested my other friends to buy it too,5
I find this product very good in use.. As surfing through amazon the reviews and the comments were are so great which make me feels like to buy this product and I found it very worth in deal... Thanx amazon for your great deal...,5
Super cool machine for general use. I use it for mere 7-8 pages a day. Working well since a month.,5
"When I went for online registration of the product in HP website, the printer's warranty, the system says the warranty expires on 21.6.2019 i.e. in one weeks time. I am not get this rectified.",3
the performance of printer is satisfactory .. but only prints 300 pages approx in one bottle of ink,5
Print Quality good but cartridges got empty in just 50 prints,5
Bit bulky but easy to install faced problem connecting my android phone but then downloaded the hp printer plugin service from playstore works well,5
It's not user friendly. Everytime I open my printer It gets disconnected with my device and I'm unable to wireless printing. And if I use through USB all I get is color print and not b/w. Seriously fed up with configurations,1

its tri color gets over too soon just 3 pages and it was over,5
"Ink cartridge usable life is too low. Full ink level went to low level, after taking 100 copies. But company has given assurance for 480 copies. After refilling the cartridge also , it is not usable. So I have to change new cartridge. So per page cost is high.",2
"Too noisy, hand most of the time, ink quality is very poor and print is under quality. It hangs and show always busy while you try for a print
Don't by product from Amazon India",1
It could be the the best printer. It has delivered in 12 hrs . It's print quality is awesome. Easy to install . Print with WiFi . Must purchase it,5
THE CATDRIGE IS VERY SMALL DONT BUY.AND BAD PACKAGING FROM AMAZON NO EXTRA BOX AND ALL,3

This product is faulty and does not work from the day one. Only thing is I started using after 2 months and hence cannot return. Called HP and they pushed me to go to Amazon. This is such a bad purchase. Don’t know if amazon can help.,1
Very good all in one printer for home. Suitable for light use.,4
Very very poor cartridge. It went off after taking 25 low quality prints.... Never buy this on line,1

They mentioned during the purchasing their ink will print pages upto 150 in coloured and 450 pages in black and white..it's clearly they are cheating ....the ink which came free with printer hardly prints 100 pages including coloured one,5
Cartridges dry quickly. Printing process slow. Power on is taken 1minute.,2
According to Seller the ink is going to finished very fast and it's not really giving us profits,5
"Very nice printer for home purpose. Print quality is good, easy to install. Only issue is sometime WIFI connectivity may have issue, but still working good. I'm satisfied with the printer",5
Using it since 1 month. I did not like Wireless network connectivity. Often printer could not print with wireless connectivity. Need to try with USB connection.,2
Everything is great about the printer but scanning can give issues sometimes and the web service to take out the printer doesn't always work ! But still value for Money,4

"Update: Never made a worse electronic parchase than this. Tray became faulty within months and since then it's showpiece. No attempts to repair helped and cartridges would dry up without use. Paper just wouldn't go for printing.

HP seems to be selling cheap quality printers only and better to go for other brands

Extra-black cartidge is missing as mentioned by many others in reviews. Really wonder why Amazon is failing to take steps against the false information without a proper escalation",1
Product is good ..HP should improve service back up for installation of its products bought through Amazon,4
Printer cartridges are not working,1
"Be cautious, being wrongly advertised!
It is not an upgrade to the earlier versions! The loading is not with a tray that you have papers preloaded. Top loading is wrongly advertised!! I cannot use the product as it is using way more space as the top flap has to be opened for the feeding. Terrible mistake to buy it.",1
Good quality printing,5
"HP Printer Customer care is worst in the world. I contacted them through their provided customer care number, through face book, by directly calling customer care nearest centers. Today it is more than 6 days, no one visited yet. They ask you to do lots of things over phone (in case you connect to them). Latter after continuous followup, they will tell you to bring the printer to their service centers (generally few kilometers). They don't send the technician to your place even you warranty is valid and intact. This is my recent experience. So call is yours. HP is big brand for sure. Same thing even I thought initially, but did not know that their after sale service is so horrible and its a big pain owning a HP printer, once there is any issue in the printer.",1
"Pro:
Has a document feeder to scan multiple pages.
Compact all-in-one.
Wireless and easy to setup, so you can place it anywhere, no need to place near the computer or desk.

Cons:
Very expensive ink.

I have been using this for almost 6 months now. Have changed the ink cartridges almost thrice already even with rare usage. Ink gets consumed pretty fast. It also records the usage and stops printing even if ink is available but the software believes that the ink should have run out (genuine cartridge guarantee function).

On an average I was able to take ~200 B/w pages and ~100 color pages per cartridge. so cost should be close to Rs. 5 per B/W and Rs. 10 per Color print.",3
"I have 2 hp printers. Very complex to setup and configure. If you are tech-savvy you may be able to install and configure drivers , still it will be pain . Need to add and search for printers and drivers every now and then, Please keep this in mind before buying. See if there are other options which are easy to setup, else will give you a nightmare",3
"The printer claims that you get upro 300 pgs but the reality is color ink support max of 20 to 30 pages and black ink support upto 40 - 50pgs.
Inks are expensive approx set of 1200rs for set of black and color.
Printer is good and easy to use.
For ppl of less use its cool.
But I have a child and I feel i bought a wrong choice because schools demands alot printing.
Whereas I also feel that cost of printing is also increased with this printer if I get it done from outside.",3
"I also faced Paper jammed for first time and resolved that in the following method:

[1] Turn the system bottom to top and check a white plate covering ... Re-fix fix this, I found this one side lock not fixed properly...
I just bought this from local store ... not from Amazon.
I hope this comments may help some one's problem.",3
Good,4
This printer takes a bulk of time to print .I am completely dissatisfied. I want to return it.,1
I bought this printer in decemver 2016. From the time of buy it is not working properly. It gets hanged for months and then you need to reinstall the software. Also paper gets stuck many times. Whenever i take them to HP service center they keep it for 10-15 days for investigation and then return it saying there is no issue with the printer.,2
"Yep!!! This is the printer which you are looking for
#GO FOR IT",4
"Marginal Print Quality.
Easy to install with the help of Youtube Vedios.
Connecting with wifi is superb.
The Internal part is more dusty when unbox.
The problem is the cartridge turn to half after printing 30 sheets(black). Color cartridge also loosing without using.
Cartridge yield is not true as mentioned in product details(450 pages😂).
I'm not completely satisfied.
If the cartridge is better, it's an awesome product.",3
"All things are best but the only problem is the cartidge

You can print approx 20
0 colour print and 380 black and white print

I printed 4 page of colour and the cartidge level shown to me was 30% of total

So all is good but the colour printing is not good",4
"First of all whosoever is seeing my post i warn you never ever buy this printer or any type of printer with theese small small cartridges because it we cost u a lot if u need a printer then spend some more and buy a ink tank printer or a laser one but just dont be hooked up
I'm saying it because when you will buy a new cartridge it will cost you 590 black and 660 for color that is 1250 rs and believe me it will give you 50 prints or less so make your choice.",1
I purchased it on 6th Jan and received it on 12th Jan. On my first try during the setup the paper got jammed and later on I tried 4/5 times to print the alignment page but the same problem was faced by me. Can somebody help me in resolving the issue.,1
"Scanner and xerox is good.. I hate this for Huge print cost.. Cartridge v.v.v.costly.. in 70- 80 pages b&w cartridge over... in 25 prints color over.. i bought those for 1400.00
Costly printer for printing..",2
Easy to use . But biggest disappointment was that it doesn’t have double sided printing utility . Never imagined a modern printer would NOT have a double sided printing feature ! Makes it so inconvenient to print odd and even pages that most people probably tend to waste paper instead ! HP SHOULD HIGHLIGHT this on their specs so people are aware before they buy .,4
"This product quality and function are okay, but the cartridge usage to print is not at good, I would say its worst.

I ordered two time since I bought this printer and it could only print on close to 70-80 Page including both color and Black & white. So you can imagine the cost per page.",3
Printer is not good and also cortriage s are very poor. I was printed 45 pages and cortriage gone empty. After I added ink in it but performance very poor. Don't buy it and go for laser jet.,1
"Never buy this worthless printer. Ink gets empty after 2 full page printing.
I was hopping HP is the top most brand but now i hate HP brand due to this printer",1
"Text very clear with B&W catridge. Colours appear decent.
Setup was easy.
Build quality appears a bit less than expectation. The plastic body appears a bit flimsy.",5
"It is easy to use, but print quality will become low if colour ink catridge is finished.You can't take good quality black & white copy even you have a new black ink catridge( but the tri color ink catridge empty). Also the price of ink catridges are high.( if it works with one catridge it may be reasonable)",2
It's easy to use but the cartridges are letting me down. Very few prints per cartridge. Instead buy an inktank printer which will be more cost effective,3
Hp agreed to replace the printer and will eventually give another old model which is either discontinued or not being able to find buyers. Basically they are eating into the warranty period so that they can revert back and say 'Warranty over'. Not worth your money or time.,1
"Nice value for money, it's very useful for mobile wireless use, it's helpful to print outside the country, it's good for me",3
Please do not buy this item I am basically use this printer and they are not received paper and after some months it's not working its cost around 5k only,2
"Product is absolutely fine
Not too much complicated easy to operate even your kid's also can easily operate it.
Online printing feature is good.
Good for your personal work but not suitable for office as colour cartridge is too much costly also will not print as specifief",5
"Wifi is the problem with connecting my laptop .one more thing I notice after a bit of print the ink becomes very low.
I think Amazon should also provide the customer care number so that what ever the problem is , it can be solved Immedeatly. Actually when my wifi was not connected, I had a problem to talking hp customer care .",3
Printer is good and quality is same also but here is a disappointing point that its consuming so much ink for printing and wipe out the cartridge nearly for 20 to 40 pages.,4
"Don't but HP printers they are big fraud... They have a memory chip inside every cartridges... As they want to gain profit by buying their cartridges , They will fake show that cartridge is fault if its new and had working also... So go other brand... HP is a big begger and fraud company",1
"Compact printer ,,fit for small spaces,,,fast printing ,,,very bright color printouts,,,amazing for school kids project works and for other daily printing",5
Product is not accepting genuine ink also after 2 years of use. Hp customer care is totally not available.. Useless..dont prefer hp,1
"Don't buy this hp 680

Printing quality not good and very very slow printing....

My advice for all better not to buy",1
"The product is way past its delivery date, have used this printer and it does what it is supposed to do. Nothing exceptional but better than wireless printers from canon pixma series",1
Worst cartridge service it gets dry for 80-100 sheets every time it’s fit for only rich kids who can spend 50Rs per page of print,1

No proper printing and speed is excessive slow, colors are getting changed after taking the print",1

Also you can control this printer using mobile app which is nice.",5

If u r a regular user plzz dont buy this .

Ink cartage size is very small and it finished fastely when u print a 50 pages.",1
I have received the printer on time but during setup it is observed that Paper Input is not getting opened. I have made the complaint to HP. I also request to amazon to take up the matter with HP for attending the problem at the earliest.,2
Over all Good printer with ADF and wifi it requires only one HP smart application to print and scan documents.,4

`Print quality and speed is good. Very good. Helping with Kid's project and work from home. Suggest to buy it.,5
Waste product. Not recommended even for home usage. One ink box can able to print only 20 to 30 Pages only. Sometimes black and white print coming with yellow background. Totally waste of cost.,1

Easy to install and use.,5
God product very nice,4
Good but too expensive,5
"Gotvit for 4250 INR from another e-commerce site during sale.

The product is excellent for home and even small office space and prints efficiently. WiFi direct printing from cross platfrom devices is a boon. I manage and print all my invoices via android.

It comes with flat bed scanner as well as document feeder that helps scan multiple documents at a time.

Its cloud ready and can scan and store documents directly to a cloud drive as well as print from cloud storage.

Comes with web server, that with just we config changes to printer and your wifi router makes it a cloud printer. Print for your kids project at home while you are travelling.

The fax capability is a unnecessary one though as rarely anyone is seen using fax now and could have been replaced with USB / MMC for printing directly via older cameras.

Paired with CISS installation will certainly void warranty, but make it a printing beast at amazingly low print rates, that cheaper than laser printers.

Hope this review is useful!",5
Printer not get printing after refilling cartridge 680. But all other are good.,5

It has a very premium look, quality is sturdy all plastic body.
It is very light in weight.
Printing depends on internet speed print quality is greatly.",5
Compared to flipkart it is costly in Amazon. But the printer is if exceptional quality. Fairly quick in printing on inkjet standards and scanning is smooth for an MFD. ADF is an add in feature. This is a masterpiece on your gadget desk.,5
Not worth the money. After a year the sensor was not working and paper jam error was persitent. Better to go for other models,1
Price of this product is high,4

Don't waste your money on HP cartridge printers as the cost of cartarages after every 250 prints Willbe ariunr Rs 1050/- for the combo pack black and colored cateridge.Rather go in for an inktank variant of Canon PIXMA 3000 series that coated @Rs 9500/- after discount in discount bonanza sale by Amazon with 15% discount with HDFC card.Also the HP care centre at Silver mall in Indore are rude and won't help you to find out the problem in your printer without a new set of cartarages because they don't keep sample cartarages with them for testing.on the other hand the Canon Engineers will come to your doorstep even at your village without asking for any cost to repair you printer for 1 year at your home,1
"This has been a solid print, copy, scan machine so far, luckily (because it's always hit and miss with printers). It was easy to set up (you need to install HP print service app + plugin on your phone) and it's easy to operate using the touchscreen panel. It's been a couple of months since I bought it and the cartridge that came with the printer hasn't run out of ink yet, but my usage of the printer can only be considered as light (< 1-5 pages/week). Replacement cartridge is on the expensive side but that's generally the case with printers, so I don't want to knock it too hard. The print quality has been good on both color and black/white prints and the quality can be adjusted based on your need. You can print from your PC as well as from your phone using the HP app. The build quality is respectable as well. I think this is a really good option for a budget medium-usage printer that's reliable. I didn't expect it to be this reliable based on my past experiences with printers but it surprised me.",5
Very good printer. Amazon should have a installation video along with product catalogue in the app itself. I watched youtube videos to install the printer. Price is ambiguous on amazon. They sell it for some time at 7500 than 7000 than some time at 6000 than sometime at 6500. I bought it at 6500 price with discount in sale. And after sale it was being sold at 5999. It was absurd. Dont go for sale timing. You find this printer in all seasons at 6 to 6.5 price tag. Rest all is good. Timely safe delivery.,5
"The product is good and serving it's purpose. However the apps provided by HP for printing is not efficient enough. The updated HP Smart won't provide option to create collage of passport size picture on 4""x6"" inch photo paper. However I am using other apps to create collage and then print the pic. Overall a good product. However HP needs to update it's apps to provide wide range of options to customer.",5
"Best printer from HP. Item delivered on time and in perfect condition. Easy to install and setup. Accompanying CD is an add on.
Print quality is superb..Yet to see how many pages can be printed with a single cartridge set.",5
"Product is a good all in one printer.
The areas of improvement are
1) You need to manually connect Wi-Fi every time you start it.. it should rather remember prefered Wi-Fi networks
2)it should remember passwords of prefered Wi-Fi networks

"Very good printer with high quality printing, scanner & wifi setup for this price. Photo print quantity is top notch too.

Never buy hp printer. First jam issue after then Cartiage issue. Other wise you have to visit with cartridge to service center. Only two color paper printed with new cartridge provided with new printer.,1
"Mac users beware! It doesn’t work on Mac and You cannot return this product. Although the description says eligibile to return within 10 days, Amazon just won’t accept a return. 1 star for not mentioning in the description that THIS PRINTER DOES NOT WORK ON MAC

Update: Brought up my old windows desktop and tested the printer. Prints came good but it has roller (continuous dot) marks when printed on glossy paper (see the attached image). Contacted Amazon and they replaced it. The new one again has the same problem! So, look like the issue is with the printer model/batch.",1
the Cyan ink bottle is only half in quantity I contacted cannon for this but there is no response from them this is a cheating of some kind.,1
"I bought this printer for 7603/- Only With Extra 2 year OnSiteGO Warranty. I am using this printer for around 5 days and here it is my experience.The Look of this printer is very good.it comes with 2 Extra Bottle of Black Color. Installation of this printer is so easy follow the manual or call for support it takes around 10-15 min for Ready The Printer for work.Print Quality is very Good.Printing Speed is very good. For 1st Print it take 30-40 sec time but then it take around 10 sec for BW print and 30-40 sec (Based on your content) for COLOR print.

Pros-
-Cost of printer is very less as compared to other ink tank printers.
-Cost Per Page is less around 8-20 paisa per page.
-Printing Speed is very Good (8-10sec for BW/10-20sec for COLOR)
-Cleaning and manianting is easy
-Borderless printing is avilable
-Document Scan with MAX 600DPI

Cons-
-SOme time it make NOISE

Overall this product is very good : )",5
"Model: Canon pixma G2012.
First of all, abt the printer: Its best at it's price segment .I got it for 8k...well it's orginal price was 11.5k.
Along the box you get 3colour ink bottles, n 2+1 blk ink bottle, power cord, connector to pc cable, user guide, warranty card, install soft cd.
Note: Canon Pixma G2010 n G2012 are same (only you get 2extra blk ink bottles in G2012)

Pros:
1)Canon colour prints are always best than it's competitors like epson n brothers printer.
2) It's very durable n having less paper jam.
3) print output is vast you can use the printer for abt 6months without refilling if you are using regularly also.
Cons: (these are not actually problems or negative sides, rather these are customer points of valuation)
1) bigger in size than other segment canon inkjet printers.
2) print speed is 10pages/min, so it you want more faster prints then go for laser printers not inkjet ones.
3) the supplier company doesnot provide extra package over the original printer box, (although canon company's package is quite enough).

Apart from printer i wld like to mention the size of box is large n weights 10kg around (with printer itself 6.4kg). So you can guess it's bigger one but portable, thus shipping is done by surface shipment(means it comes by delivery truck) so it takes some time to arrive n be patient to wait.
As air shipment doesn't assure the product to be received undamaged so amazon prefers to ship via surface shipment to assure it reaches customer end safely.",5
"This is a very economical and user friendly product.

1) Ink Tank is integrated and filling ink is very convenient.
2) Can make quick copies and operation is very easy. Can directly take a color photocopy also...
3) Saves a lot compared to Ink Catridge printers.
4)Most importantly it works on Office/Home Battery back up system, (remember Laser printers require higher power and often don't work on UPS systems.)
5) Cost per page is low.
6) Scan quality is good.
7) Allows manual duplex printing.

Cons
1) PC Hangs during high resolution scanning......
2) Paper feeder on top , so cant leave the paper in the tray always (you can't close the protective flap when paper is in the feeder).
3. Paper falls down after printing , if the paper holding tray is not pulled out.
4. Not for professional, heavy use....",4
Not working properly paper jam print quality low color print not proper mix colors print,1
This product isn't compatible with Mac OSX. Confirmed by Canon India. The older model G2000 is compatible with Mac OSX. Strange that the newer model isn't supported. Product video is misleading.,1
"Print quality is good.. i tested color printing on both A4 and 6*4 Photo glossy paper it is good i will rate 4 out of 5..
you will get 3 bottles of Black ink, 1 Yellow, 1 Cyan, 1 Magenta.
I strongly recommend you guys watch Canon Pixma G2000 series Installation videos on youtube. there are few complex steps while getting it to run correctly....",5
"The item delivered at night. Invoice provided with (downloaded) has no mention of product serial number. For availing warranty, service centre matches product serial number printed on product with that of the product serial number mentioned in the invoice. I requested invoice with product serial no. but not provided till date.",3
For black and white printing this printer is good but color printing is really worst and not worth for color printing...no return policy makes buyers very difficult as this product really un-realible,1
"Reading all the mixed reviews I wasn't sure if I made the right choice. But now I can say that I was right. Packaging was good, installation was easy, took hardly 30min for the complete process and the prints are awesome. BW prints are crisp and clear, color reproduction is amazing. I have attached an image printed on normal paper at high quality. This image is blurry as my mobile camera is not good but the original image is a lot better. Scanned color image is almost similar to the original. Only issue is that the USB and the power cord are a short. And the best part is that I got it for less than 7,500 during Amazon prime sale under lightning deal and HDFC bank offer.",5
"Awesome print, standard color xerox has turned out to be so good and crisp with colours and details. Amazing product. Check out the picture. One on the left is colour copy and right one is magazine.",5
"I purchased canon pixma G2012 printer through online which is received on 30/06/2019 Sunday in good condition. But I am failed to install the printer to my windows 7 computer. Because I think the installer CD drive was not sent for the machine, but it was for G2010/G22110/G2210/G2410/G2510/G2610/G2810/ & G2910. Photo of the CD is added. Now in this condition I wish to get your help and suggestion about easy installation of the machine to my windows 7 computer so that I can install and run it smoothly. I am a regular customer of amazon. When I insert the installer disk in my decktop com. and click on MsetUp4. exe it shows that 'this program can't be used with the current operating systems.

Thanking you
Matilal Debbarma, customer.",2
"Go for it ,No doubt best
I was shocked that people and shopping sites were giving very less feedback for this cannon product. Some people are following crowds , crowds are going for Epson then all following instead of applying their brain.
I purchased it at price of 7199 after 10% cash back discount &and at this range no one can compared it with other . I am using it from 2mnth without any problem.
Print quality =super
Color/Black print= super
Scanning= super
The main advantage of this printer is that it compact Design you love it , it's ink tank was inside the printer so you can move printer easily without any disturbance.",5
"Works decently (using for 6 months or so). I'm down 2 bundles of printer paper already but the ink is more than 3/4 full even now. Of prints ~97% greyscale (B&W)(70% draft quality and 30% good quality print), 3% colour (varying qualities on printer paper). Not the most portable - because the ink tank printers are meant more for economy than portability - need to ensure every tank is locked down before moving to prevent ink spills. Had a few papers stuck up with cheap 65gsm paper. But no problems with standard 70gsm and above (most of what you get in shops.)
Scanning works well too. Canon software works well for all basic purposes( that's as much as i need).
All in all, i think, this is the cheapest home printing technology that you can get right now. I printed a bundle of paper in a day as i found its effectively cheaper than getting it all photocopied and definitely much cheaper than getting it printed in a dtp center. And canon functions well.
Only thing I would have liked to have is wireless connectivity (could have got a higher model for a little more).",5
Initially the printer was amazing purchased in October 2018 but now i.e. around July end i started faceing issues of paper jamming and then the color head of the printer is damaged according to me and i am unable to find any color head for this printer online even when i found one it costs 3.5k with many negative reviews. I would soon be calling canon customer care and then update the review. I wish they give some discounts regarding it's still in warranty period.,2
"The printer is very good. Easy to install and look wise is also very good. The print quality is very good; I do not understand why some people have said it is bad. It is very important that the manual is read while the installation is done though it is very easy, it is highly recommended to read the manual.
Over all the printer is very good, works very nice, and quality of printout is excellent.",5
"The printer is very good and u will get 3 blank ink with box and one set of 3 colors, very easy to install and use the ink tank is inside printer which takes less space compared to HP where ink tank is outside",5
print quality is worst... it gives zigzag printing... canon and amazon said that this is not fault. not considering it even issue...,1
It's a waste printer as before we learn printing one page we would have eventually wasted all the color ink. It's sprays the ink internally without a paper thus wasting the ink. Quite difficult to understand and adapt the behavior of the printer.,1
Product name is Canon Pixma g2012. And kit including warranty card is of Canon Pixma g 2010. Cross checked with Canon India. They refused to provide any service in warranty. Even serial number is also not matched to any of Canon product.,1
"Bought for home use, which could be an overkill!, but cost wise better than cartridge ones.
Comes with 3 black ink bottles, which is a big plus.
Easy to install on own, taking care when filling ink - and better opening one bottle at a time.
Worked well with Linux , not needing any driver etc.

At tank filling, and initialization, levels in drop by 15% for black ink, around 20% for colors, since some ink will get filled in tubes. No ink levels seen in Printer settings, obvious as its manual check, though it has low ink detection.
Regular prints come out fine. Photo printing (on 150gsm) comes ok with no streaking, except for roller lines which etch onto the page but not noticeable from a distance. Photo printing would need some calibration wrt to Monitor & print color. Better to use either canon supplied software or other photo suite.
Scanning utility interface (IJ Scan) is not that friendly with multiple dialogs coming up rather than managed it in a single app window.
On Linux not yet gotten scan to work successfully.",5
"Good product overall. The only drawback I felt was the paper feeder. In this printer, the paper feeder is at the back of the printer. Because of this the paper feeder is open all the time and there are chances for dust to accumulate.",5
"Writing review after using it for 2 years.
Print quality is fine
Speed is a bit slow
Colours are perfect
Major drawback
Doesn't support mobile printing...which seems to be marketing strategy as it has usb...some software print using mobile seen it on youtube but it's disheartening that CANON cheated on this part as they excluded this model from their app of mobile printing...other brands of this range support this feature as its very basic one just need to update software for it.
But after repeated requests they denied that its not capable but I have seen a shop owner doing that perfectly using third party software...SO CANON IS AT FAULT THEY SEEM TO DELIBERATELY MAKING INCONVENIENCE FOR PEOPLE SO THAT THEY WILL GO FOR HEIGHER MODEL",3
"Hi Have reviewed multiple feedback and then placed my order and when i received the product, I was happy to see the performance.
Quality is Good
Printing time is also perfect and Black & White print is really fast with excellent quality.
The most important part that I observed, is it through errors in details like : You did not power off properly and switched off directly from Plug, Paper Jammed, print quality change etc. I liked the printer, and would suggest people that opting this printer is not a loss.

I know in this model Wifi is not available but happy to take a bit effort to print through USB as at this cost I cannot expect Wifi.....

Thanks a I hope this review would help you to decide.",5
"Pros: Multifuntional, i.e. print-scan-copy or all in one printing machine, Low printing cost, good print quality.

Cons: Ink blockage in pipeline if printer not used for few days and flushing is d only solution for recovery, and a huge amount of ink wastage/draining will be there for d flushing operation.

Very much noise during paper intake.

Sometimes paper jamming hazard.

Power cable and usb cable orientation is improper and length is short.

Verdict: Over all performance is better than other printers in d same price range and hence can be bought.",3
"Very much dissappointed with the performance os the printer. I installed it as per the guide book but lot of noise is coming and the printer is not responding at all. All sounds like kat kat kat is continuously coming and the error shows E03, sometimes E02, P02 etc etc. I specially ordered it for my 4years daughter so that she could have her exams smoothly during this lockdown period. But now I have no choice but just to wait for the replacement. I dont know when the replacement will be made but one thing is sure that CANNON cannot compensate the loss which my daughter will face because of the non availability of the printer. Very very sad experience.",1
"I had great confusion between Canon and Brother. Finally bought this Canon G2012

Reviewing after using 3 weeks.

1. The printer is Canon G2010 as model when connected. The only difference they added is there is a LCD display and copy + button. Else is same. But LCD is useful to know status. There are two blacks ink additionally in the box...which will face our black prints throughout years.

2. Print Quality is awesome. You can expect a photo print quality when used glossy sheet (attached yellow poster).

3. Normal sheet printing aslo great. (Attached vintage poster).

4. Speed is as follows

An A4 borderless color printed at maximum of 40-60 seconds.
An A4 document printed at 5-10 seconds
An A4 xerox at 2-10 Seconds.

Speed varies based on colours used

5. Connectivity - Laptop connectivity is good.. Use can also print from Android using OTG. (Nokoprint app recommended).

6. Scanning - Quality is great... You can scan and print which looks like printout. We can also scan and store it as pdf.

7. Canon software - There are A-Z printing functions available in the app... Only thing is the app is slow. There are options to print borderless, collage, passport size maxi, calendar, visiting card, pamplets.

8. Overall you can go G2012 if you need multi-purpose printing. Scanning - Xerox - Print - Borderless - Mobile print.

Highly recommended if you are more creative.",5
"it started making noises from paper feeder after 4 days of normal use, even with silent mode.
color ink also makes good quality paper wet and deformed shape.
i am okay with this just for using to print papers for reading offline. it may not suit to others for regular home use.
it is also very bulky and heavy than shown in.pictures.
i highly doubt the published pages per ink bottle. the color ink seems going away quickly.",3
"my usage is very less maximum 50 pages per month. its still running good quality of printing is great. black ink capacity is higher than epson, HP. two black ink bottles are bundled with this printer scanning is also very good. only problem after ink filled move this printer or when relocating take this printer very carefully to avoid ink spillage.",5
"PROBLEMS IN THIS PRINTER :-
IF you use TNPL paper , the paper would get jam very often. Printer is a bit noisy too.
The cartridge placing area and when you load
and lock the cartridge it automatically unlocks and black cartridge which result in paper jam and ink loss. If you do ink flush to fill the pipe with ink in case of removing and re inserting cartridge it would consume 30-40% of your ink within each ink flush .
ROLLER JAM is a common issue
PAPER LOADER JAM is another issue
errors that i received are E02, E03 , E04 etc. This is my replacement product for first G2012 .
It is solely for WINDOWS
No good ink tank printers in this price range other than hp 310 but their services are bad but Canon i think its better but I'm not sure . If budget is around 8300₹ there is no other options available than hp 310 and Pixma G2012 . Overall its a great choice for Students and Office work . Print speeds are slow but decent",3
"Value for money product. Easy to use , ideal for sharpen high dpi photo printing... Always use genuine Canon ink to get accurate colour of photo printing...

Very good quality scanner... At xerox time , if we print 2 or more copies of one document,1st page print needs some time but other pages other pages print quickly...

3-4 A4 b&w pages/min & 2 A4 colour pages/min ; 1 4/6 inch borderless photo print with high resolution in a minute....

It's don't have OCR & AI to clear background colour of documents & auto straight document facilities... Also, it has no wireless printing.... It has an advantage, to print on inverter during power cut...

G2012 has no facilities to print from mobile & on internet , only usb printing is supported on windows (Mac not supported)...

Overall , it justify it's price...",5
"I loved print quality, I bought it mainly for my kid as we had to take print of his assignments and then scan them back in to laptop and send them to teachers, thans to corona :). Print is very good, even color pring is very good, not too concentrated, just right amount of color is used by printer. I wish it had WIFI. Just because WIFI is missing I have to take my laptop and connect it with USB and then print scan what ever. Well we can live with it though, not a big deal, but WIFI could have made things much flexible. Overall product is excellent and it wont disappoint you. Remember : No WIFI.",4
"After using it for more than 1 year, this is the update on the review:
If you are not using atleast once per week, don't think about buying this printer. The ink gets dried inside the head and you need to do deep clean and refill the head with ink to mkae this work.
During the lockdown period, when the printer was not used for just over 1 month, even after all kinds of cleaning and ink filling it did not worked for majenta ink color. Half the tank of ink hit consumed, but no improvement was seen.
Had to take the head out and using the instructions on you tube clean the head. This and manual refill of the head got it working back.
Now after the school holidays I have to do the same thing again as again the printer has stopped printing properly after being unused for 3 weeks.

Old Review:
Migrating from another Canon MP all in one printer with excellent photo printing capabilities with a high cartridge price to a ink tank printer these are my key observations
Pros:
>Very low print cost
>quite fast at draft quality
Cons:
>Pictures are washed out and lacks colour depth like earlier canon printer (in both normal paper and coated photo paper)
>install is not easy unless you use the video guides and are handy with computers and printers
>Software is not as user friendly as it used to be",3
"I am using this printer for around 45 days on windows and here it is my experience.The Look of this printer is very good.it comes with 2 Extra Bottle of Black Color. Installation of this printer is so easy follow the manual it takes around 10-15 min for Ready the Printer for work.Print Quality is very Good. Printing Speed is very good. For 1st Print it take 30-40 sec time but then it take around 10 sec for BW print and 30-40 sec (Based on content) for COLOR print.

Pros-
-Cost of printer is very less as compared to other ink tank printers.
-very low ink consumption.
-Printing Speed is very Good (8-10sec for BW/10-20sec for COLOR)
-Cleaning and manianting is easy
-Borderless printing is avilable
-Document Scan with MAX 600DPI

Cons-
-Some time it makes NOISE
-Some time paper jam at colour printing on 75-80gsm normal paper

Overall this product is very good",5
"Model: Canon Pixma G2012.

I got it for 8635/-. This is a good printer at this price range.

Pros:
1. Fairly good print speed
2. Two additional black ink bottles
3. It produces high quality prints compared to many other brands I have used
4. Original product from Vietnam, managed to register online easily for warranty

Cons:

1. Driver for G2012 seems to be not available. But I have used G2010 driver as it is compatible with this printer.
2. Noise, noise, noise. What the hell is this Canon? This is the noisiest printer have I ever used. Those who like train's running sound will surely enjoy it.
3. Borderless printing is not up to the mark. Borderless print is supported well on some types of papers. But it doesn't support well on normal paper and executive bond sheets. Therefore, those who want to use it for letter head printing might face some issue. Canon has to learn more about borderless printing from BROTHER printing company.
4. Printer software is not up to the mark. I have used printers from multiple brands including Brother, Epson, Samsung, HP etc. I would say this is one of the worst have I ever come across. Software has to be more user friendly, with more features. In my experience BROTHER has better software.

I will be updating this review after using for another 3 months. Anyway, irrespective of the flaws, considering the price and the print quality I would rate 4 Star for this machine.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 It is a multifunction printer it means you can use this for print, scan and copy (black and colour both)
Print quality is good
Easy to install, just download drivers from Canon website or install from CD (included in box)
I am attaching some photos and video of printer

Box Contents : 1 printer
1 bottle of cyan, magenta, yellow (for colour printing)
3 bottles of black ink (you will get 2 bottles for FREE) :D
1 User Manual
And 1 CD for drivers (you can easily install drivers from Canon website if you don't have cd drive)
I installed mine from their website.
As I mentioned earlier you will get 2 bottles of black ink for FREE FREE FREE

Cost of printing : As mentioned on box
Black and white print - 9 paise per page
Colour print - 21 paise per page

You can print approx 5000 pages from 1 bottle of black ink
And approx 4000 pages from bottles of colour ink (cyan, magenta, yellow) combine.

Hope my review will help you..",5
"One of the best and economical printers in the range. Has superb durability, I did 1500 pages in one go (colour n Black white mixed). No issues faced. The no. of pages that can be printed per cartridge is not as mentioned in the description. I used up 50% of the B/W cartridge for around 1200-1300 pages in one go.

Colour printing is slow but can be managed. Will give best colour printing results on photographic paper ( even better than laser printer).

Best suitable for small office n home setup.. heavy duty n easy to use.",4
"Canon Pixma G2012 wa delivered in one day, thanks Amazon for same. Two additional black ink bottles provided in box. This adds to value of printer.

Installtion
Install instructions are clear. The booklet with printer has detailed instructions. There is also video available for installation steps. Steps are easy but it helps if you have some experience of working with electronic equipments. Be careful while putting print heads and filling up ink tanks.

Setup
With Windows 10 there is no need to install drivers separately. Connect PC/laptop with provided USB cable and operating system will setup printer.

Size and weight
The printer is larger than average home inkjet printer. You need to keep is horizontal while moving as it has fluid ink.

Print Quality
Color print quality is good. The print speed is also good. I printed couple of color prints and colors were pleasing. I need to check scanning and photo copy. That I will update after trying both functions.",5
"Value for money. Print quality is good.
There is option for selecting couple of printing resolutions.

Very helpful for printing my kids project work and other urgent documents.

The scanner and copier options are also very helpful.

I have stopped running around cyber cafes and photocopy shops as I am doing printing, scanning and copying in the comfort of my home.

I am using it on my windows laptop. Wish I could have used it on my other Mac book air laptop too.

May be Canon should include this option too in this model.",5
"This Printer 🖨️ is amazing. Quality is so good for both colour and black and white print. Ideal printer for Home use at affordable price specially fo school going kids.

Some people leave negative comments because of frustration which create confusion at the time of buying product which I faced during my purchase.

Ignore negative comments for this product. It is genuinely a good product.

Hope this will help people to buy this product easy without much hesitation.",5
"Bought printer, and delivered after two days.. some issue with delivery may be due to covid.
Overall printer is good it has been 1 week+ and took 30 - 35 photograph and 100+ print out for my kids school homework.
Black Print : Very Good
Look and Feel of printer : Excellent
Color Print : Good

This printer is better than the my old Printer Epson L130 which was worse.
Did not required any Cannon support installed self with booklet for installation.

Software's downloaded for scanning which is available form canon and scanned 300+ documents for some personal use and quality was great in color.

photocopies quality is also good.

Overall experience is satisfied with printer, but print quality is 99.9% only, not very fine like photosudio quality for color prints, but its ok for kids home work is fine.",5
"Self Installed by following user's guide & video, took some time but was successful.
Everything can be done except duplex printing and is not compatible with iOS.
Photo print is best in the segment after making suitable changes in printer properties function.
Supplied with 3 coloured +3 black ink bottles (2 extra).
Ink tank function is good, and lasting.",4
"●Printing speed is fast as compared to other brand (epson,hp,etc) of same price range printer.
●Print quality is good,blk/wt print are excellent, colour print is bit low( little bit fade) as compared to epson,but it's ok as it compromise the print quality with great speed.
●Has small display which is a great add-on as it help to see the count of print.
●I like the integrated inktank body design by canon.
Besides it has given two seprate head for black and colour inks,which is also a great feature which give canon a upper hand as compared to other brand.
●Page intaker/collector/engager design is good.
●Printer is pretty easy to install and use.
●Print commond software is also great and has an extra feature to add up some space from margin which is of extreme help for non editable documents.
●The only downside of ink tank printers is the ink is not waterproof, ink spread out even a sign drop of liquid is dropped,which ruin your printed document.",5
"Amazing printer at reasonable price

Although i don't think it can print as claimed, I'll try to update review after a month or two

😉 You can print with otg also just download nakoprint or printersharer app from play store

Installation in just 10 min

Scanner is 700dpi (at least that's what max showing in custom scan option)
Stitching of scanned files also available (though its manual)

Photo print will consume more ink but it will give avg studio like prints ; )

It uses ink pumps so no risk of ink clogging, dont try to get cheaper printer to install CISS, it's bad idea CISS will cost 1000 with no pump, no service from company, cartridge will leak after some prints... Its just mess...

This is best at 8.3k (2 additional black ink bottles)",5
"Pandemic has made a lot of school from home and printing class notes , thisprinter turned ecnomical. 75Gsm paper we use and no issue so far. Some settings need to do else you waste lot of ink. It depends what you want . If official doc change to high , normal notes set to standard. Photo printing is also not bad 4R it came quite well. I mostly use for class notes print.
Scan and photocopy also excellent. What I like is with a OTG cable I could connect to Anorid phone and take direct print from mobile, then why invest in other models of printer at higher price.",5
I used to have Canon B&W laser printer before this. Need to buy this because of color printing for my daughter's school projects. I get same Canon quality and trust. Print quality is perfect and fast. Only one issue is that USB cable is ridiculously short so some of you may face issue if your laptop is a bit far. That's the reason for four star else this is worth five star. And you get total three bottles of black ink.,4
"Quick delivery from amazon during sales really appreciate that.
1.Black and White print/copy quality is excellent but color quality is decent.
2.Mac is not supported so not for Apple ones
3.Well inside we get 2 extra black ink bottles.
4.For installation one can call canon customer care for physical or on phone installation as per his/her convenience, canon was quick to sent technician to install at home.
5. Well and nothing much is there to review.",4
"Beware: This doesnt work with MAC.

The printer is awesome and easy to setup with step by step installation. I got it at 7500 with sbi deal on great indian festival. Also the printer comes with 2 extra bottles of black inks which makes it an even better deal. Also, you do not need to buy a wifi printer , you can use cloud printing to print from your phone without using a wifi , so this printer gives me the best deal with overall all the benefits. Go for it !!!",5
"BOUGHT FOR 8600+
PRINT FROM PC/LAPTOP IS NICE,PRINT FROM SCAN IS POOR(quality)
Edit(after few days)Lot of Scanner issues, edges missing in scanning",1
"This is a good budget printer for the home and small business user. The printer is easy to setup, but you definitely need to consult the user manual. There are also step by step setup videos available.

The print quality is decent, I had to calibrate mine initially because the sharpness in the color prints was off. However now that it is setup, it's all good.

It is pocket friendly as it gives a lot of prints per ink bottle.

The con is that the printing is quite slow compared to conventional printers .

However overall it's a great printer.",4
"Got roller marks on photo paper. Canon specifies photo paper upto 270 gsm for this printer. I got roller marks with 200 gsm paper. Very disappointed.
Printing on normal paper is good. Print speed for B&W prints is decent. Colour print speed is also good.
Amazon replaced the printer but unfortunately the replacement also had same issue of roller marks on photo paper.
Returned it.
Those who want to print on photo paper should avoid this printer.",2
"i am writing this review after using this product about 8 months its really good product because its working good not too fast and its ink capacity is very good for use, i print about 800 black and 500 colorful prints and its working so much better than other printers like linkjet,its inktank its very much protected because its on printers body and its not consume too much power and caring because its cannon inktank printers. thanks for reading it and i suggested to buy this on amazon because its delivery agents are too good and it save your money college and school students its very much easy to use.",4
"Normal paper print quality is excellent but I am getting Pizza Wheel Marks in all the Glossy print I took.
I couldn't find solution online, some mentioned it would not occur if we use CANON Photo papers but I couldn't find CANON photo paper for sale anywhere online.",3
"Excellent print quality. Not up to the laser printer standard but this is pretty impressive.
The colors are great they came out a bit dull but superb reproduction of colors. The printing speed is good too. Have to see how it performs on long run. My Doppler scan images are awesome to read.
Thank you Amazon for giving me this excellent printer @7000 bucks.",5
"Product delivery - ontime. Thanks Amazon.
I was using Hp 2540 earlier, therefore I am writing about my new printer in comparison to earlier.
Plastic and material - OK.
Ease of installment - Instructions very well written and therefore was easy. The glitch came in pairing it with the desktop. The printer wire was of poor quality and very short, barely 1 meter. The local Canon dealer told me that probably it was fake , so he gave me a new 3 meter one, of-course on payment.
Print quality - Black - is more dark grey. The colour is not as rich as in HP, I hope it would improve with the nozzle opening up with time.
value for money - time will tell",3
"I'm here to write one of worst experience I have ever faced with this printer & the service they didn't provided. Printer Stop working in just 6 months.its shows some technical error while the command for print was given. I contacted the customer service for the repair service (1 year on site warranty). The customer service executives told me that the printer is unserviceable because they can't send a service engineer to resolve the issue. The way the customer service sealed was quite unfair & language used was not in the way of professional also. My suggestion is better to go with Epson and Hp printers.
Really feed up with the service and quality they provide for me.",1
"i am very disappointing with cannon printing , even when cannon engineers complete installation and next days i print some image document that was very bad quality and i called to engineer and said that if any issue in printer i can return and take upgraded model but he told that sir printer is okay and may be issue in image quality , three days back i received assignment of my daughter from school and when i print picture quality is very bad and i called him again and cannon engineer spend complete day but not resolve my issue again next day other engineer comes and after try many thing he dark some print quality , i am not satisfied , but according to him they could not fine from them , now as per return policy i could not return the product , but its educate me that i will never purchase from amzon or any online platform where if issue will come and i dont take any action.
i looked your add that amazon means Apni dukan , but there i feel that some one make foll to me and that is cannon and amzon.",1
"Decent. Color prints are not very similar to the original. Ran nozzle cleaning alignment and other tools, but output is dull. Not sure about whether it has to do with the quality of paper. Power and data cable are relatively short. Somewhat noisy.
Ink bottles capacity: 135ml black & 70ml for each of the 3 colours. Comes with one full set of 4 bottles plus 2 extra black. Each bottle fills tank to top with no balance in bottle.",3
"Works like a charm. Got it for 9k with 1black ink + color + Extra 2 black ink bottles is a good deal. Black prints are good, color prints on paper are just ok, but yet to try color prints on photo paper.",5
"The printer quality is good but output is not like hp. I bought hp 2135 and canon g2012 at the same time. Print quality of hp is far better than canon. Some people said that this printer can print pvc id card, which it cannot. I had to make a jugad to print pvc card (600gsm).",3
"Amazon packing .. top class

Canon packing .. top class
Especially ink bottles. They are sealed air tight.
Included items ... Printer, Power cable, USB cable, 3 color ink bottles, 1+2 black int bottles, Black and Color print heads, Windows installation CD, Getting Started Booklet, Warranty Card.

I did install in my laptop running Linux Mint. As per the getting started book i did fit the print heads, filled the ink in the tank.. Finally just plug the USB into my laptop. Thats it.. working very well.

Thanks amazon..

Thanks Canon.",4
"Very Good printer, more so because ink tanks are integrated with the main body of printer. Occupies less space.",5
"Good product. Print is good so far after a week use.
Only faced trouble in installing software as its not compatible with windows 7 and i had updated to windows 10 and it worked fine.
USB cable is bit small and hence to print laptop has to be connected very near.
2 extra black bottle in box makes a good extra printing.

There is one issue. The grounding is not good and slight cutrent flow on metal exposed lart like USB PORT. Internal circuit should have proper isolation.",4
"If you want best quality print then go for Epson.
I am using Epson for 3 years. No quality issue.
I brought Canon G2012 for more printing.
I can see the difference between the two company.
Print quality is bad of Canon.
It makes more noise.
Build quality is also not up to the mark.

Coming to the delivery : it took 5 days.

Packaging : There is no extra security. They sent me with company box. No outer box was. The bill was applied on the company box.",1
"Bads- You have to be patience while printing. Everyday when I switch it on the printer it takes 45-55 second to take out first print. If you want to do multiple copy it takes time.. overall it is very slow

"It is a good product. Obviously, because this is Canon. However, previously i used a hp printer. And I feel that although colour consumption was high and cartridges expensive, brightness of the prints were better than this Canon. This i feel, although I am not am expert in these matters.",4
"This is a cost effective printer, and it's print quality is very good. Also, the scan quality is absolutely amazing. The install was a breeze and I would highly recommend this printer. The printer inkpots have a rubber/silicone cap, please make sure to not yank it too hard else the connected portion will break.",5
"Excellent technology
Scan is very excellent
Printing Speed Ok
Copy speed Ok
2 free Black Ink bottles suppiled along with 1 full set.
So total 6 ink bottles suppiled free with printer.
Each black bottle gives 8000 page print out.
So for 3*8000=24000 pages , we won't purchase ink.
MOST ECONOMICAL",5
"i was really pissed of the service from Amazon.. The way their customer service representatives behaved with customers.. This product is not compatible with Mac OS, earlier they said we will refund you and later another representative was rude and said they can not because the product does not fall in refund category . When i checked this product with my friends house it is pathetic , the print quality is very poor ..i do not recommend this ..",1
"i purchased this thinking i will get the effect of printing quality equal to printing press and ,not a worth printer for 10k ,i value it for 5k,colour print in A4 is verybad ,black and white is good in draft mode",1
"This printer is excellent at this price range. 4x6 photo quality print takes one minute. Print colors are true to life. If someone want vivid colors, this is not for you. Overall scan, print, copy performance is good. B/w A4 paper print is a bit slow, but I'm ok with this.

My father uses this as standby xerox machine and primary photo printer for our photo studio.

Best part is, you will get two extra blank ink bottles, each has 6000 paper yield as per canon",5
"I had faith on Canon products and also on amazon delivery. But, I was little anxious about the actual functioning of PIXMA G2012, as many questions always remain unanswered in case of online purchase. Though a few days have elapsed after I have purchased this item on 13th September, 2019, I can say it is quite a good printer. The machine does printing, scanning and makes photocopy as well. Very nice design, smoother operation and makes minimum of noise. All three functions are quicker than what one can expect with a small device used at home. The print quality is very good and there is no sign of lowering of ink level even after printing 70 copies (about 82 black and 8 coloured) by the machine. The price is also reasonable at this standard of performance. Installation was little cumbersome and I had to seek help by the technician of Cannon. They had provided a free installation at my residence on the same date. Once it is done, nothing much to do on the machine's regular performance. Thanks a lot Canon.

I am also thankful to amazon for their prompt delivery as usual without any damage of the product placed within a firm packaging.",4
"After using this printer for an about 11 months ; I can review this ;

Pros :
-Smart Price
-All In one functions
-Good print quality
-Easy color printing at very low cost
-Speed is also good
-Useful for home & office use (not meant for very high duty)
-Scanner works superfine
-Extra Black Ink Bottles with printer
-Company representative comes home to do all the setup (You can do it at home, but better to go for authorized person)

Cons:
- It doesn't have wifi support.
- Printing is not water proof. Even if a single drop of water spills on the printed paper , the color on that paper gets disturbed.
- You can't keep inkjet printer idle for more than 7days. You must need to keep it in working condition by printing at least 1 or 2 papers each week.
- Original Ink bottles to be used as prescribed but those are costly (at least for me)",4
"It is mandate to give 1 star, otherwise 0 is good for this purchase. I got defected product and when I consulted to the Engineer, he told me to make around Rs 1,000.00/- more expense to repair it's printer head. It's a cheating. Very disappointed with the purchase. Never recommend to purchase these products from Amazon.",1
"This printer is best for a student or a college going students because there is always need of print colour pages and black and white pages or sometimes 100-200 pages notes also . It's good for everyday working

"Colour printing quality is excellent though the speed is little bit slow but its considerable for home use... Overall Printing quality is excellent...

Colour xerox not up to the mark but the Black and white is acceptable... overall Xerox quality is Average..

Delivery by Amazon is very good and reached on time but the packing is not good, no extra protection by amazon even there is no air bubble plastic raping only a simple transparent plastic cover over the original box of printer...very much disappointed by amazon...

"Good performance so far. Even good for commercial purpose. If use only for home purpose, ink provided with printer may last for lifetime

"I am writing this review after using 1 year

The print quality is good
Scanning quality is very poor
But the print speed is very low
If you don't use your printer for a while the print head will be clogged

The main problem is that you won't get genuine ink from market( in my area)
The bottle looks same
You have to check it , there is no supply of ink by the manufacturer through online

I am dis satisfied with this product

I am using various types of printers for last 8 years

Dont buy this
If you need a printer
Go for Epson or BROTHER
HP IS ASO GOOD",2
"I liked the product. Very easy to install the printer after watching the videos.
Fast delivery by Amazon.
Print quality is very good. Scan is also found good.
I also tried on glossy paper, photo prints are as good as of digital studio.
Value for money.",5
"Purchased it an year back now its colors have become faded. Also black printouts are bad. Also the printing heads need replacement frequently and costs a lot. Overall the per page printing estimates are wrong it is expensive and useless product ,",1
"Canon Printers-- Best value for money--Home & Office use
Pros--Good looks and easy to install.
Fast printing.
Prints even on single page put inside
the printer.
Cons-- Print quality is ok--just above
average.
Purchased on big billion day sale.
Made a profit of RS.2400 on purchase w.r.t market price with extra 2 black cartridges included.",4
"Cannot use with linux as no driver works.
Also after a month or so after not using, need to do deep cleaning of the nozzles. Therefore need to keep printing regularly to keep the printer in shape. Otherwise great value for money.",4
"Such a good product ... good product in reasonable cost .. But I always suggest all the coustomers,if you buy it during fastive seasone the you get such some good discount.
But the Packing quality is not sob good when I receive the product at that time there are multiple hole in the box it's like someone punch it useing some hard sharp knife & there is a slight scratch on my printer that's why I'm not Happy with the delevary careing ... other than it this product is absolutely good",3
"It's been 12 days and I've printed almost 1000 pages (500 pages × both side) and now I feel i should share it wid u...
Pros:
Quality (you will not regret)
Ink (after so much pages ink level didn't came a inch down😁)
Scan (mirror)
Color print (not to say best but neither in the category of cons)
Weight (palko par bitha lo)
And lastly the black color printer is looks gorgeous

Cons:
Speed (a bit slower)
Sound ( 🥁)

And lastly you must consult to expert who r using hp, brother and come back because it's the best...",5
"I was of the view that Canon provides good quality products but after using this printer I changed my opinion as there were issues the printer shows errors within 3 months while printing. The complaint was made by me and the product get repaired but just after completing one year warranty period, the same error started again. The engineer visited and gave an estimate of Rs.3,500/- which is almost half of the printer price. I decided not to take any product from Canon.....",1
Good luck finding drivers for any other operating system other than windows. Mailed canon support and they confirmed that they do not have drivers for linux or mac OS for this model (Pixma G2012). None of this is mentioned prominently in the startup guide that comes with the printer. So you don't really get to know this until after you have wasted your time filling the ink tanks and placing the inkjet heads.,1
I purchase for my school my clerk says the performace is best he printed daily hundreds question papers for upcoming annual examination.,5
"It's a good buy. Had initial hiccups with ink flow and installation. It is advisable to seek Canon's help to install for the first time. Else, warranty is at risk. This wasn't told to me.

Updated Review after more than a year... Did not use it for more than 8 months... And seamlessly worked when resumed use. Fabulous!!",5
"Installation in windows 7 repeatedly failed. Even your technician failed to install. He suggested us to change version. Then i called technician from out side and got it installed for Rs.300/-i think your canon technician s are not fully trained nor updated.
For me PRINTER is very good.",4
"JUST FILL THE INK SHUT IT AND READY TO GO.
FOR THE FIRST START.
1. PRESS POWER BUTTON ( SHOWING INK ICON )
2. PRESS BLACK BUTTON
3. WAIT FOR 5 MIN.
DONT PRESS ANYTHING UNTIL DISPLAY SHOWS 1
AND THEN ITS READY TO PRINT.",4
I've even taken passport photo prints and numerous B&W printouts ... All have turned out well and no change in ink levels ... It is a little slow to start and print but works really well for moderate frequency uses...,5
Black and White print quality is good and pretty fast too. Color print quality is also not bad. However there are roller marks visible when printing on glossy paper. Not sure if it is because of a defective piece of if that is expected,3
Not happy at all. No user guide tells me how to install . If there is any problem no customer supports. No manuals tells me it's functions. Which buttons gor which purpose. When I print in photo paper the black ink gets removed if you touch the photo even after one day. No customer support at all.,1
"I am using this printer since 10 days and it is very ink efficient for black and white as said in description, but color printer quality is low and does not truly duplicate a image. If you need a higher quality prints for color, better go for a higher dpi model",5
"The Canon Pixma G2012 is a very bad product. Its not compatible with Mac OS and has no wireless printing, which is not mentioned on Amazon while ordering. I want a refund or an exchange of product, but now it is saying that the return option has expired. Very disappointed with Amazon for holding back important information. Request one of your executives to get in touch.",1
Easy to install. I could install within 20-25 mins. Print quality is decent. 2 extra black ink bottles are provided with this model. I got in independence day sale for around 8400 with SBI card offer.,5
Awesome printer. Nice prints. Only one drawback i see. No linux drivers available. Printing from linux is not good. Windows no problem at all.,5
"Printer is all at its best condition still after using around 3-4months. No issues I've faced till now!! Printing quality is good but ink consumption is very low. I got two black and a CMY ink set alongwith the printer, inside the box. It can print on normal A4 pages as well as Glossy photo pages and even in the Matt photo pages also. What I lack in this is the wireless printing facility, which I know is available in the costlier models and the maximum size for the supported page is letter and the printing speed, it takes around 10-15secs to print a normal black and white A4 print, also there is no automatic both side printing facility is available. But as its a home purpose printer its not just good, I think its best.",5
"Why by this printer.....
1. Much cheaper than other printers
2. Best print quality
3.Improved photographic prints from Epson.
4. Looking awesome .

## after 4 months....
I've been using it for four months. There is no problem yet. Already above 1000 pages print ( 20 A4 size photo + 40 4/6 size photo prints ) others black .. see ink level after 4 months..",5
"Very good print for home use. But, the roller mark on printer makes the glossy paper print looks odd. Is it common?

Uploaded photos after 1000 pages .. Ink tank is still 80% full.",5
It's a very nice product. Just follow the instructions booklet and it takes 20 min to be up and ready. Good set of functions available in the scan utility like scanning multiple pages and creating a single pfc in 1 go.,5
"Awesome printer in budget.
Print quality good Black and colour.
Good service by Canon.
Home visit for installation done with demo.
Onsite service warranty which is a good part.",5
print cost ok .. but paper jam ... worst.. i bought mistakenly second canon g2012 printer 2019 october.. but same paper jam problem like as g2010.. already i have g2010 with paper jam often.. but minimum 2000 prints for a ink bottle black and white... epson L380 not having like this paper jam problem... also l380 printed 2000 black and white papers...but king of worst yield is hp 2131 white small printer.. only below 100 pages from one catrige amount is above Rs600..,2
"Very good print quality, both black & colour, including photos in A4 paper. Easy installation with the help of included manual. Two extra bottles of black ink included. Scanner is also of very good quality",5
"Printer Paper feeding Problem, After 10-15 Print, Print Quality Is Best. I think this Model is not Genuine even Model Not Listed on Manufacturer Site. May be Refurbished Version of G2010.Amazon Replace Printer. But Problem was also in Replaced Printer Same Feeding Problem Comes After A glossary Paper Print.",1
"I am able to install and use on my own. Very useful for taking xerox, scan and printouts. Color printout is not too good. But, can be used for school projects. Own use for xerox and scan (scan quality and xerox are superb).",3
"its really good printer, have used it more about 3 months n giving this review. m really happy with the product. only disappointment was it did not ship to my location imphal 795001, i ordered to my friends add in delhi n got it.",5
"It dosent have wifi printing option and dosent work on apple devices. The installation take a long time and is not very user friendly. Look for better options, as this one is not worth all the hassle you have to go through",1
No nonsense printer and scanner. Works seamlessly. Loved it! The software could have been better to allow editing or viewing individual sheets during scanning a bunch of documents (this feature was available on older Canon scanners). But the hardware itself is fantastic. Would highly recommend it,5
"Not working properly... colour image print stuck between half page... Ordered just before lockdown... and after using only 1 day lockdown happen.
Then didn’t used for more than a month and then return policy expired.
I was left with no other options.",1
"Hopeless product, doesn't support Mac OS, and amazon doesn't specificaly mention about it. Will be lying idle for years as amazon not willing to take back the product. In the end consumer suffers.",1
please don't buy this Canon printer as their is no after sales service.Scanner stopped working within 2 weeks .Since then have lodged numerous complaints with call centre and emails no response.Nobody turns up.Sell and forget policy.,2
"Very good printer, copier and scanner. All instructions to install and fill ink were properly documented. Speed of print is quite fast and print quality also is quite good. Easy to scan and save in different formats.",5
"Very sturdy printer. Worth buying if you like to remove lots of print outs. Economical in maintenance compared to other printers, as the ink bottles are not that costly. Also very user friendly in installation and other physical aspects of the product.",5
"Guys,
I got this printer from Amazon Prime, with super quick delivery and placed a installation call with Canon and within 2 hours the installation guy was there, I suggest all buyers not to install this printer on their own, as if any defect is there and you installed it than it will be repaired and not replaced, so always secure yourself with the installation from canon",5
"First of all Thank You Amazon and the crew members behind this product. Installation process is easy,follow the instructions in the manual.I have been using a canon 2500 series printer, in comparison with both the new one(G 2012) is economic and easy to use.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Super printing and. Good deal obtained on amazon @ 7600. Only drawback i think is That is the printhead cost is very much high and dificult to get original canon ink later.",5
"I'm writing this review after using this printer after a year. It's such a good economical printer which can be used for office purpose. The print quality is good in black and color for office documents.

Not recommended for professional photo printing",5
"past 4 years i used epson L550,and epson L800 ,L805 now to move canon pixma g2012 , i got offer price at rs 7700, best deal and best all in 1 printer, like colour xerox will come very fast and sharp,u can print art paper also, maxi photo print borderless come good quality ,speed also good,2 print head available for printing, that new head also little cheaper comparing epson printers.",5
"Wish the printer drivers were available for WiFi printing via router. Otherwise, the printer is value for money. Even dealer is prompt in response. Worth buying.",4
"It's Only been 6 months, I brought it on 16 Jan, 2021
And, it's 15 June 2021
The printer does not print
Black colour text.

"product is awesome but whenever v start printer, it takes time to initialize itself. print starts sometime later. this is the only con i feel about this printer.",5
"An excellent printer, easy to use.I use it occassionally to get copies of documents and for writing letters. Like the cartridge printers the ink does not dry fast even when not used for ten days. I got it only a month back I am very much satisfied with it",5
"Don't buy Canon printer.
Waste of money.
Technician doesn't want to come home, they says, do printer setup by ph direction.
Very bad customer service.
Guys ,Buy another company product .",1
"It’s a very good printer . Software installation CD is with it and after following all instructions as given in pamphlet, printer functions smoothly.Print quality is very good it’s compact as ink tanks are within not outside.",5
"Product is simply superb... Till now printed 500 copies of black & white, and it is almost front and back, 70% of the black ink still showing in the tank.. Good millage sofar.. Purchased in Great indea sales with 20% offers.",5

"Its good product till date working ok
You can print freely without any tension also the print speed is good for photo prints the speed is better then Epson or hp what i have used",5
"Good inktank printer with free 2 bottles of black ink, sure it will save a lots of money we usually spend on buying costly ink cartridges and low yield of cheap printers. After one year both printers will cost same to you. So go for it, saves a lots of money in long run.",4
"Print quality is very worst,only original has bright print. Scanned documents prints are very light and blury also,dnt buy this quality less price high 2000/- printer best than this.worst",1
The product quality is not good - when printing it is shaking and sounds,2
THE PRINT QUALITY IS AWESOME .VERY EASY TO USE .BUT INSTALLATION IS NOT SO GOOD .IT OFFERS FREE INSTALLATION BUT THE INSTALLATION TEAM IS NOT ABLE TO INSTALL IT IN TIME . WHENEVER I MADE CALL TO INSTALLATION TEAM THEY TOLD ME THAT THE TEAM WILL CALL ME WITHIN 4 HOURS BUT IT IS NOT SO. MY WHOLE DAY IS WASTED BECAUSE OF CANON INSTALLATION TEAM....,5
Received the product on time from Amazon. After that was able to call the Canon customer care to arrange for the installation free of cost. Print quality is good. The scanning and photocopies are also coming quite good in both black and white and color.,4

I would like to thanks Canon Service Engg. I received my printer with problem in printer head and I called service center in this regard they assured and provided quality service. Got printer head replacement. Now getting amazing prints.,5
Printer is good and does the job pretty well. Though since this is liquid ink it's better to be use this atleast once a week to avoid the ink drying up and leading to service.,4
"Very bad don't buy this product, canon not good , buy Epson only. After 20 prints printer not print papers empty papers coming.",1
"Best printer in this price segment.
If you want a good printer for home it is highly recommended.
For office/shop I prefer Epson as its printing speed is higher but doesn't print on high gsm photo paper while canon prints on high quality photo paper without any trouble.
Ink efficiency is great.",5
Check the service in your area before order. Also call the number that mentioned in product description. If it wrongly mentioned then not to buy,1
"GOOD. Installed after reading the instructions carefully and seems to be working fine. Have taken extended on site warranty, to be on the safe side.",4
This printer is specifically for home use and the print speed is slow comparative to other printers such as brother or hp. Another drawback is that the printer always keeps nozzlee cleaning. This I never experienced in Brother make printers,4
Fastest delivery at Covid time. Good Product and print quality. Easy to install by ourselves. Good purchase on budget price but I think this is priced only Rs-8299/- as per mentioned in the youtube videos. But I have purchased at Rs 11990/-,5
"Excellent printer.Aweome print quality.Ink easy to insatll.Ink saving printer.If you thought for buy,so no doubt go for it.its perfect for personal and also buisness purpose.",5
I love this printer because printer quality is better than epson and hp and also print cost is better according to price other printer are costlier and offer this printer type printing cost so i love it !!,5
"Printer specification states that it supports various paper sizes
A4 / Letter / Legal / A5 / B5. But Printer does not functions with A5 size (it works only with A4) , printer always ejects the paper
by just showing 3 rectangles to the left of the page without printing the content of the page. Wasting all my pages.",1
"Non availability of WiFi.
Print quality is good.
Printer setup is easy.
I use it for printing both documents and photographs.
For print quality, higher resolution printing go for photopaper and you will need to set paper setup and print quality accordingly.",4
"Probably a bit of old fashioned model. Print quality is good but takes time to print. Main problem is, the print is 'windows only'. All efforts were gone in vain to make the printer linux friendly! You can use android though.",4
"Happy to use. Good deal for 8k. 3bk bottles 1set of colour bottles
Print speed bit less but the quality good

Update
Very good for photo printing also. Kodak photo paper200gsm",5
Print quality is great and prints at decent speed. Doesn't have a duplex printing but that is not that big an issue. I have printed around 100-150 pages(mostly monochrome) and the ink levels have hardly gone down. Good product for home and economical. Lacks WiFi though.,4
First printer body is not proper and second things is ink video show’s wrong printer guide book is true way so please remove the video and make sure printer setup video true that can help to customer not confuse.,1
"this product is easy to use,compactible product.printing time is very less,but is printing quality is not that good...it is ok but for color print it is a bit dull.but overall the product is awesome.it is easy to install as well.",4
Nice one. Better to choose wireless printers for taking prints from android phones directly,5

It is delicate, the box was damaged, the printer looked ok with some scratches but the ink tank chamber was damaged somewhere and ink was leaking.",4
"Good printer at this price range.
Ink efficiency is very good. Scanner is awesome.
For more details, print quality test, features and functions & review, watch my youtube video, search "" canon pixma g2012 best deals india""",4
For Normal Home Use the printer served to be more than handy and Economic. Though the colours from the print seemed to be a bit faded its only for home use so nothing much to complain.,4
"It's really compact and easy to use. Color quality is good and the print speed is fine, not as fast as you'd expect. Can't complain as of now.",5
"It's one of the best printer I had , work's fine without any problem, some time paper got stuck but it can pulled out easily,no problem so far",5
"It comes with 3 Black ink bottle and 1 C, Y,M Bottle. Easy to setup , Just remember during cartridge head installation remove the orange stickers and the orange plastic protector .",5
I bought this for I card print. It print nice but consume too much ink in auto head cleaning. After every print it cleans head. Abhot 40% waste in cleaning. Print speed is slow but OK for my bapplication.,3
"While installing for the first time, black ink didn't flow from the tank. I have raised a complaint to customer care. God knows when it is going to get repaired.",1
Printing quality is too good.the only thing I didn't like is I didn't got cd or DVD for driver. over all good. Value for money 💰,4
The printer was Installed last night and I have not yet used it much. But I notice the colour pictures don't come as crispy as my old cannon ink jet printer.,5
"This printer does not support Mac OS. there is no driver available for Mac for this printer. While contacted to Canon Customer care they suggested me to change my laptop to work with their Printer.

PS. I am thankful to Canon's suggestion as my computer costs 15 times of their Printer.",1
I didn't get any assistance from Amazon or canon...even help desk didn't provide any help...there would have been free installation or demo had I bought it from local market....my biggest mistake to buy it through amazon,1
"Printing quality is good compare to Epson ,scanner utility option is not user friendly like Epson scanner software , ij scan utility is difficult to use , can't rename while scan ,after scan only we can rename the file , for printing using Canon and scan i am using Epson V39",5
"Please do not buy this model . This model does not have any Wireless setup and also realized that the support for Mac OS is not there . Due to Covid , we waited for a week to open and realised that now we cannot return it as well . Got completely fooled with it. The review does not mention it explicitly.",1
"It's worth it at the price range.
Only CON is the print speed.
It's much less than what they say it is..!! Almost half the mentioned pages per min..!
Other than that, everything is awesome about the printer..!",5
Good product good printing quality easy to use using for now 2 yr no problem face and the ink does not dry and can left without working for 2-3 month,4
"It's not worth, printing qlty poor, it will impty the ink just for 300 normal prints it self..louder sound making machine, go for epson",1

The printing speeds are very slow.",3
"""Nice and good printer""! I ""recommend it for medium usage"" but one thing is not good, you have to go offline market to purchase ink. Because most of the online stores not providing Genuine canon ink. After using few months editing review, Sometimes paper JAM occurs. Need more caring to printer. It can easily clogged.",3

Driver cd is given me along with is G2010 why you did not send me G2012 driver Cd. It is not good that you had send me previous version driver cd. Otherwise every thing is nice,5
"Wi Fi is a big miss for a printer like this. Atleast it needs to support OTG cable connections to Mobile/tab.
Print quality is gud
Touch buttons is a big miss",3
"The product is goood... I got it for 7200 only. And the printer is good...
The print quality is good... But you have to print regularly or alternate days otherwise ink will be jammed",5
I would not recommend anyone to buy Canon products.They dont even bother to act upon your request. I phoned the Customer Care thrice to send their Engineers to install but noone came. Very shocking substandard service. Canon lacks professionalism.,1
Only problem is that cartridge head gets dry and it is time consuming again and again cleaning it,4
"Amazon quality of product very worst , printer deliver to me non ops , I choose return option but Amazon cancelled return window I suggests don't purchase any product from Amazon",1
OMG!best budget all in 1 printer.got 3 135ml black ink bottles.quality printing.before printing use the software to clean nozzle,5

Awesome printer. Worth the money invested. If you are looking for a printer with ink tank option and without wireless connectivity that this is the model to opt for as it is value for money,5
The product was delivered with one ink bottle half full. Canon refused to entertain my complaint saying that they do not prefer products to be purchased by Flipkart Or Amazon. Dear Amazon assist to supply a replacement ink bottle .,1

"Don't go for this printer bcz of its price
Price is low but service is too bad

Not installing in win7 or 8. Not even through downloaded OS respective os installer.,1

"Good Print Quality, Installation procedure was very simple. Value for money. Overall an excellent deal from.Amazon.",5
"No setting in the software for custom paper sizes. The software is always pre-selecting paper size, for example- Letter size even for A4 & it prints for letter size in A4.",1
"Go for it guys , for installation just check YouTube

All the qualities are just as good as expected.. But the problem is.. you will have to use it regularly..Otherwise the ink ket gets blocked and will take so much time to print for first one..,5

Data Cable connection laptop and printer is short",5

The only thing is it cant pring more than 4000 of back and 3000 of colour.... In Ink provided.....,5

"Very bad,not work, please replacement, your service center fraud",1
Too bulky and not as expected. Unable to return it yet as only expensive and cumbersome self return is possible. Both amazon and the manufacturer don’t provide pick up. Review product details more carefully as you might just get stuck with it like me.,1
Go for it. It serves the purpose. I bought for my cousin's Xerox shop....works seamlessly.,5
"Just too good , though it does not have the wireless connectivity , but very useful for small offices",5

"Unable to Install the Printer drivers in my laptop ...Useless information... Not compatible to windows 7 ultimate.... But in description it was mention that its even compatible to Windows XP..
Checked in many other site for solution ... It's most common with Canon printer software... Many people undergone my situation ...I can't able to use the printer even after 3 days of delivery..",1
"Delivery by Amazon was superb, got next day itself. However it prints everything in pink when color option is selected, the other two colors are not working. Tried several options..",1
"Very nice printer. Easy to setup took 30-40mins for setup. After ink filling it takes some time to complete the process or be ready for printing. So have patience after filling the Inks. Printing is very good and fast. color print - i have take one print so far that too on simple paper but it was nice.

only draw back is canon app is not suitable for Mobile printing - directly through OTG cable. I suppose company should give app that can print through OTG cable directly attached to mobile or tablets.",4
i bought this printer for my cousin and its a good efficient and low cost printer.the print quality is good and scanner also works fine..overall its a good printer anyone looking for a printer can go for it .thank you if u like my review plz give a thumbs up.cheers,4
"There are no details provided that this Printer does not Support Mac OS.

Amazon Please add this kind of key information in the product details.",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Update after 9 months. - no issues faced.
Mainly used for school related black and white and colour projects and homework. Also printing pictures occasionally on glossy photo paper and taking photo copies. Very happy with it's working.

Performance has been good for all my home printing needs. Good use for kid's school projects and ocassionall photo printing.

👍Easy installation. Just follow the provided guide or video online.
Refer to pictures taken during self installation. If you are not comfortable handling electronics you can get free installation service from Canon.
👉 I installed SW drivers on my Windows 10 machine.
👍 Excellent printing of text and documents.
👍 Good for home and office use.
👎 No duplex (both side) printing. You have to manually print put the paper back to print on second side. You can do it by printing odd and then and even pages of a document and putting paper or adjusting sequence of pages correctly.
👎 Controls on printer are basic and display is basic segmented LED and only shows number and moving light indicating status.
👍 Text and documents in BW and colour come out good. Tried documents and graphics including cartoons etc. See a sample image of lion and a mouse printed on standard chart paper cut into size of appx 4x6
👍 Photo prints are really good in terms of clarity and colour reproduction. Use photo paper for better results. I tried glossy photo paper and surprised and happy by results.(see sample - one print on 4x6 photo)
👍Good quantity of ink provided in the box. Set of 3 colour bottles and 1 black bottles + 2 extra black bottles. Should be good for many thousands of prints. Canon puts yield at around 6000 B&W 7000 colour pages. Actual usage yield will depend on what we print.
👍Ink bottles included in pack are high yield ink bottles which fill the tanks fully. Black ink is 135ml and each of 3 colour bottles are 70ml. Compared to old cartridge style inkjet printers this is huge amount of ink.
👉 Ink part numbers are GI-790 (Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow).
👉 Current cost of ink from Canon is Rs470 per bottle (black or any colour) in Oct 2018. Even if you get a yield of 4000 pages B&W and 4000 colour pages compared to claim of 6000 and 7000 cost of 4 bottles set will be Rs 1880 so you will get an average cost of less than Rs 0.24.
👉 Adding pictures of product and pictures of initial installation to give you idea about the product.
👉 Also see image of test page and sample photos to show colour reproduction on a glossy photo paper.
👉 Also adding a colour photo copy sample with original.
👉 Successfully registered warranty on Canon India website - 1 year warranty is applicable.

☝ Tip - Inkjet printer ink is water based and anything printed including photos will not be water proof. So protect photos and prints from water and moisture. If you want photos or prints to be water proof you can e.g. use fixative sprays or lamination or store them in albums or a frame. For photos I wish photo printing ink was water proof or atleast if there was paper that makes photos water proof.

☝ Tip for photos - Our screens on phones or computers are usually set to brightness levels that photos look bright and pop out where as printer will print based on brightness and contrast on the image taken by camera so you may see prints to be less brighter compared to what you see on screen. You should be aware of this fact and as needed adjust the photo parameters like brightness and contrast, try few images - compare what you see on screen vs prints, before going with actual printing job.

Getting used for school projects and homework and for ocassional documents and photo copies. Happy with performance and costing per print.

Happy printing.",4
"I got this canon g2012 in SBI card offer on 12th August 2018 for around 8500 including 2 yrs extra on-site go warranty.
Black prints are good but colour prints may not be up to mark for many of us. For me I will give 3 stars for colour print quality. Please note print quality depends lot on quality of papers also. I have not taken photos yet just use normal 80gsm paper for black & 100gsm for colour letter heads only.

Scanning part is ok ok only, you cannot take proper good copies of photocopies but passable. I prefer using cam scanner app instead and then taking out prints.

Overall decent buy for INR 8100. Still exploring so will be updating review after 2 to 3 months.",4
"Wrost product printer properly not working

Printer 1 months me kharab Ko gaya",1
The printer is supposed to provide a crisp and clear printout. The problem faced with this printer is the colored printout is very faded not a true printout. Previously I had HP inkjet printer and this printer print quality is no where near HP printer. Even black and white prints are not truly nearly HP inkjet quality.,2
The Demo Video provided on Amazon is wrong regarding Ink Charging. The button shown to press for INK Charging is wrong. Actually you are supposed to press the button below STOP Button instead of STOP Button. That took one hour to decipher with the help of YOU TUBE. Pl. correct it.,3
i got this printer today. i install it easily. used it. everything is very nice. print quality is also fine according to me. i think this is best for personal home use and small office. its great. hope it will work fine as future.. u can buy this. no doubt.,5

"I have earlier used Canon Pixma MP287 with a third party installed Ink tank which prevents the owner from getting Canon warranty. Canon G2012 is Compact, nice positioning of the Ink Tanks in the front. Even though I made a call to the Canon Team for installation, I could manage the installation from YouTube. Canon Technician duly called me for installation which was a pleasant surprise.
As far as Print quality, I am not very impressed. I do a bit of scanning & colour Copying, hope the machine does well in the long run",4

 This is our 1st printer.

We ordered this on 6th August early morning - it got delivered same day late evening. Product packaging was very nice and compact - didn't contain any Amazon packaging - only Canon's packaging - however, it was quite well packed. We had to sanitise every part of it and self-installed it - didn't face any hassle - watched 3 vids on YT.

We had ordered Easy JK copier A4 packs with the printer, whose quality was below avg. The drivers and s/w apps on the CD are quite handy. However, colour ink quality on print (as you can see in the attached pic) is very dull and average. However, if you print from fresh Word doc that you create, the colours are coming better. Black ink is satisfactory - toner saving ink feature works as well. Tested with image garden - working cool as well.

Haven't checked with photo paper >75GSM - so will update about it once the photo papers are delivered.

There ""may be"" a setting where the colour quality can be improved - haven't checked that yet - however default quality is not that good.

PROS:

1. Awesome packaging and same-day delivery
2. 3 black ink bottles (1 default 2 extra) and 3 colour (C,M,Y)
3. Price was INR 8499 with Prime Day and HDFC card's 10% discounts (quite good for the less price per page it offers)
4. I printed 346 papers so far, don't find any drop in black ink level. Zero. Will print more papers and review price per page.
5. Colour paper print is considerably fast (9-10 secs)
6. Colour o/p quality of colour photocopy is brilliant and crisp - not so for printout - bizarre, but true
6. Installation is pretty easy and straight forward
7. LCD display for easy detection of printer readiness
8. It needs a 2-pin power port, not a 3-pin.

CONS:

1. Colour ink output quality is not up to the mark (tested with 75 gsm paper), can be better
2. No Wi-Fi connectivity - so printing from mobile or PC in another room is a hassle
3. No auto-duplex - you need to manually flip the paper lot with manual duplex and time consumption is x2
4. B&W print doesn't work without both B&W and colour ink fed to chambers
5. Extremely noisy - can hear the noise literally from a room with door shut 15 ft away
6. When main chamber is lifted (for ex, to check internal components in action), printout is paused
7. LCD display reading is stagnant at 1, not showing paper count (maybe a change in setting needed)
8. Black paper print is slower than mentioned in Amazon listing (8-9 secs)
9.

MY VERDICT:

My priority and key factor for purchase decision has been maintenance cost and thus I found this printer very helpful and rated it 4/5 stars. I can live with all its cons as long as it doesn't break down all of a sudden for no fault of the user after 3 months, so to say. As per ISO standards, paper cost is Re. 0.08 per page (B&W) and Re. 0.12 (per page colour) - good for someone who prints 200-400 booklets (once or twice in a month).

However, if you're buying one for rare home usage, I'll suggest you go for lower models but with Wi-Fi connectivity and auto-duplex feature that are extremely handy and essential (maybe ink-advantage models). But do buy this model if you need to print lots of papers at short intervals and don't need to use it from PCs in multiple rooms remotely. Noise is more than I expected, but definitely less than those copiers in local print/copy shops.

<Photo and video attached>

Hope you found this review useful for your next purchase!",4
I hoped it would be good. But the printer is only printing in pink when I am trying to print in colour. I tried troubleshooting this problem by following the manual. Still nothing worked.,1
"If you think that this printer is cost effective then read this before purchasing.

Printer claims: 6000 black pages, 7000 color pages, total 13000 pages in 1880₹ ink bottles which are 4 in number.

It also uses two print heads or cartridges which are CA92 and CA91, combined cost is around ₹5000.

5000+1880 equals ₹6880. In that much amount printer claims to print 13000 black and color pages, please take note that this number is only talking about color pages and not color photo prints.

So, the average cost per print is ₹1.9 which is ₹1.70 higher than canon claimed cost (20paise).

There's no info about the life of print heads and when they needs to be changed.

So, suppose even if you complete 13000 pages and then buy new ink set for ₹1880 then it is not mentioned that whether you have to purchase the new print heads with ink bottles or the old ones can be used. If replacement is needed then be ready to shell out another ₹5000 for cartridges.

This printer is only cost effective if its print heads last for a very long time otherwise not.

Don't get fooled.",2
"Canon G2012 All sequence models of TANK PRINTER.
Third Class Printer in the Market.
That I am after prolonged use write this review true with honesty as your also face below problems one day.
1. The Printer Eat Ink as a sucker worm such blood of you and in the initial first set up the Bottles in new Printer and go down to Half ink level.
2. The inside Formatter PCB card of Printer contains EEPROM Chip IC no. (416RT 533K ) which service mode blocked if you press buttons frequently and use canon Tool kit Softwares to correct Printer himself. Then after no PCB card available and if available, it cost Rs 2500/-
3. The Ink Absorber cushion pad which put in the back of the printer inside the machine, in just 3 months soak all four inks excessively for each print so much, and finally when it fully soaked all INK full with its capacity then printer gave an error of code 5B00 again to take Canon Service center and cost Rs 1000/-.
4. The Original Botle of Ink of 70 ml each of four-color comes Rs 2100/- which cut your pocket like a thief cut. if you use local bottle the Printer refused to Recognized it and gave an error of INK cartridge and stopped working to Print any page. it also contains ink level restriction attached which prevents to a certain level of iNK reached no Print may print until it fills up with Original bottles.
5. The daily not use of the printer for prints gets dry ink into inside pipes and air comes and then Printer refuses to work and goes in 7 blink error mode called Amber to Green and green to amber and not correct without service station of Canon who charged Rs 1000/- from you.
5. That the Printer Head of this model is Rs 2500/- which also a direct theft on the consumer of Canon who out of order in one year and dried quickly for not to work.
6. The Parts of Canon Printer not available and when anyone gets out of order or stopped the whole Printer now called a Trash BOX.
It is better to dig this Printer in the soil of the land.",2
"Canon Pixma G2012 - Box contains printer, 2 print heads, 3 black ink bottles, and 1 ink bottle each of Cyan, Magenta and Yellow, 1 Power Cable and 1 USB cable. USB cable is very short.
Paper has to be fed from rear tray only. There is no bottom input tray.
Scanner is flatbed only and there is no document feeder.
Physical installation is a little detailed but easy.
Need to be a little careful while pouring the inks in the ink tank as it is very easy to spill it if you are not careful and slow.
Software installation in Windows through CD as well as online is easy.
Software installation in Linux Mint 20 MATE 64 bit OS is much much simpler, as both the printer and scanner drivers seem to be present in the OS already. Just select Canon G2000 series in the printers while installing and start printing in a few seconds. Likewise, scanner is straight away detected in both 'Document Scanner' and 'XSane' apps. No need to configure anything.
Pleasantly surprised and impressed with the ready Linux compatibility of this printer.
Print quality in B&W as well as colour are good.
Scanner resolution is also good.
Attaching a few photos and Linux screenshots of scanner and printer.",4
"Really well packaged and delivered by Amazon. Coming to the product itself, probably one of the best available in this price range. The printer came with three bottles of black ink and one set of the Colors. Seems to work very well with the initial setup . Takes a bit of time for the first time you boot up. But post that it is awesome.",4
"I bought this printer before deepawali 2020 , it's almost 2 months gone and I have taken more than 500 pages .. no issues i found till.now. v.nice printer its v.usefull for college and school.students and office uses . As I am doing research in engineering I need to take a lot printout for my studies. It helps me more. But back to back print we have to feed manually that's also v.easy. the software itself will guide us for back to back print. Its 100% worth if u r about to but printer sure u go can go a head.. ink is everlasting... I can take further 4500 pages black and white

Color printer I have taken just few. Weekly only one color printer i take that also not needed but just to make sure the cartage is working good",5
"We use it for home its an good printer in this range considering the fact it has auto duplex which is best for printing books for school students printed one for my nephew.

its speed is good in simplex mode
but its very slow in auto duplex mode not more than 2 pages in a minute 🙄

print quality in black is ok not gr8 same with color

it takes around 3 minutes to get shutdown more than my windows 😂

its easy to install just watch the video link shared in the documentation

printed lot prints in past 2 months but i dont see any changes in ink level it looks same when i first filled the cartiages so dnt worry about its ink efficiency.

overall its an value for money for home users",3
"I am writing this review after 6 months of usage.
I was looking for many different printers and then I was advised by a photoscan shop to buy this printer as he has used other printers of Epson and rest and this printer gave him no issues, it's good for daily printing and also photo printing in glossy paper of 200gsm,
I have printed 100 pages a day as well and there were no issues.
Note- keep taking out a single colour print in every 15-20 days and you will never have problem with the printer head which is common issues with printers,",5
"One of the best home printers available in the market at this price point. I got it for 7.9k which this printer truely justifies.

Print quality is very good for b/w and decent for colour. No point comparing it with laser since you ain't getting one with all these features at this price. But for sake, lasers do a better job.

Copying and scanning are also good, though a bit slow for higher resolutions. Scanned documents are vibrant and HD-like.

Its integrated ink tanks appeal a lot to me, saving on space with a robust, compact design. Ink consumption is pretty low so expect a good number of prints, although not anywhere near what the company claims. I expect it to be 2-2.5k for b/w and upto 3k pages with colour, same goes for all brands.

Btw, buyers should stop complaining about lack of features like duplex printing, wireless and ADF. If you need them, shell accordingly. Higher models with those features are available in the market.

Coming to the cons, yes it does have a few, printing speed is very slow. Even slower than what the company claims. I counted 4-4.5 ppm for b/w, depending on the contents of printing. So, didn't even bother for colour. Other brands offer higher speeds.
Also, the USB cable is unbelievably small, ~1m. Canon, not exactly where you should have cut the cost.

But given the price, it's the best deal if not the best printer. For the same features it's definitely a few bucks cheaper than others. Use it with care and it's a reliable product. I'm your happy customer, Canon!

Tip: Do not go for cheap 'compatible' inks which are flooded in the market. They'll make your printer a junk piece. Excercise cautions to ensure you only re-fill genuine inks, made by the manufacturer, for quality, compatibility and longevity.",5
Useless old model. Very poor print quality compared o any ho or epson. Aleays paper jam. Service center cant resolve this. Better to stick with hp epson or brither. Simply avoid it. If you gi to canon india site it will show as archived model and drivers.,1
"Head nozzles will permanantly get clogged unless you clean printer head thrice a day, you will waste complete ink in cleaning and its still wont get unclogged. Inside ink pad will get full and you will spend full life changing those pads that are cut in very funny shape and locked inside the printer base within plastic protrusions. This is a junk piece only.",1
I bought it on October 11 2018 at lowest price of 6400 (Price - 7999/-) 10% discount on SBI card and 10% as Amazon Pay Balance. Great deal at this price. But refill inks are costlier than Epson.,5
Inck cost ok but you change head 6 month once 2500 RS so don't buy please don't buy more than 1000 rs you spen Epson or brother good result don't buy ho cannon and other printer pls my request and papper tray is worest some rain comes papper jam is confirm don't buy please,1
"The printer is good for document printing, but quality of photo prints is extremely worse (very poor colours).

Refillable ink-set costs around INR.2K, prints 6-7k pages as per specification.",1
"I have brought this product 1 year back. Just after 6 months the printer started showing issues, all colours were not getting printed. I have contacted the Cannon Support and technician came and corrected the issue.

Now just 4 months after that i am having the same issue happening again and i need to contact the cannon support team again to get this fixed and each time i need to pay Rs 400 to them for service.",1
"I also bought it on October 11 2018 at lowest price of 6400 (Price - 7999/-) 10% discount on SBI card and 10% as Amazon Pay Balance. Additional 3% discount dut to interest saving on zero cost EMI for 6 months. Superb deal. Performance yet to be seen, will update further if good.",5
"I was in dilemma -- what to select Canon or HP (kept aside Epson or Brother) for my colour photo printings! After a brief research, I opted Canon and I was right. Prints are crisp, but colour reproduction is not that great. I tried B/W docs and photos, but the print quality is inferior than that of my Ricoh SP 210 su LASER printer. My two weeks use reveals that the ink bottles will not be able to produce claimed number of pages (i.e. 7000 pages) at least for colours. Let me see how close will be the output. However, the greatest concern with this printer is the AVAILABILITY OF GENUINE CANON PRIXMA GI 790 INK BOTTLES. I bought one set from ITGLOBAL. Ishall update my review in due course.",5
Totally annoyed as it doesnt support MAC that too when this is their latest Model. Dont understand if Canon is going back in time as MAC is one of the major OS platforms and how can they stop support,1
The printer head stops working after one year and now they are saying it is like a cartridge and is not covered under extended warranty.,1
Don’t buy if you use Macbook and also has no Airplay so no prints from my iphone. How useless. just lying in garbage ... belongs there only.. no standards from Canon . Had njj ok problems with HP ever like this,1
"Wastage of money. Installation is complicated and not at all compatible with windows ultimate. The phone number given for contact for installation is either fake or nonfunctional that is also useless. It is not desirable from Canon or Amazon either, at least for the sake of their own goodwill.",1
Little expensive than competitors but with marginally higher price you get the best quality. I run a small business and this printer especially has been the best in class. The cost per print has been extremly low and the print quality has been nothing less than top quality.,5
Poor service quality and image quality is very poor and after 1 year printer create the problem so don’t purchase the item,2
"Each time I try to print, it says an error occured. But no error except that I have to press the On button again. Untill then your repeated trails will pile up in Documents for printing and if you won't delete them, all of them will be printed.",4
Printer came as expected. Packaging was proper and Product is very good. Though i havent used upto much extent to check printing cost but quality is very good.,5
Good but not perfectly manage in all situations and also some times it's working slow than before so please take a note upon this,2
"S size ink prints only 30 pages, makes indicator blinking regarding shortage. Very bad experience on Canon, you guys cheating. DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF S***.",1

But my six sense is telling me that it WILL be a good printer.
For now I am giving it 5 star.",5
Nice printer.but cost is high here.8999 on Flipkart.,5
"Purchased as a replacement to my HP wireless printer which was not economical and need frequent costly cartridge changes even with minimal use and throw up too many errors.

Printer is good, well made and compact enough for home use. the print quality is good, and print speed is also acceptable. Came with 3 bottles of black ink and one bottle of CMY each which should last a long time for normal use.

My printer had Paper jam issues on initial setup itself eventhough there was no paper present. Had to call the service centre who had to openup the entire printer to rectify error in paper sensor. To see a brand new printer all opened up is a bad thing. It works well now. The service guy was prompt though and did warranty repairs",4
"Writing after a month use. No problems so far. Crystal clear laser colour outputs. Fast, less noisy, efficient ink use. Good packing received.
Thanks Amazon.",5

"I brought this is sale, but waited 25 days for canon guy to install it, then he started aking 900 rs for installation, messed up ink and tank, too much spillage,
Only 1 support centre in 100 km radius in himachal,
no replacement for broken item, no professionalism,
I would suggest to go for hp or epson, so that even if there is a problem atleast you can get easy support.
I made a mistake by going from canon worst printer company",1
"First day first show👎😡
Very Disappointed
As you see colour where not properly set as picture
Totally worst",1
The printer is ok to use from cell phone but a huge challenge with my windows 10 laptop. Multiple times reached out to the HP cust care and the engineers keep suggesting options which is mot really resolving. One of the supervisor from HP cust care called up and tried to divert the issue and his tone was not polite. It has been 10 days since the purchase and it is Unpleasant experience until now.,3
"Nice product, all function available, futuristic product, wit wifi , scanning copy, multi function.

Only cons is the set up via mobile app it is easy for setup watching youtune video.

But for window installation it is difficult, as it is a new printer,hence driver properly not worked, u need to take guidance to HP customer support.
Hp customer support was very helpful guided me 2 hrs & get the installation completed.

Ink consumption still not rated, as 1 week only i am using , quality & usability aft insatalltion is pretty good for home use..",4
"1) Printing SPEED per page VERY SLOW,
2) PRINTING COST OF PER PAGE VERY HIGH, TOTALLY BOGUS / MISLEADING INFORMATION CIRCULATING BY HP THROUGH FABRICATED ADVERTISEMENT REG HP PRINTER 2723 JUST TO MISGUIDE CONSUMERS/ CUSTOMERS. HP-805 CARTRIDGE COST TOO HIGH BUT PRINT OUTPUT VERY POOR ...ONLY 25-30 Pages. ALSO 805 CARTRIDGE NOT EASILY AVAILABLE EXCEPT AMAZON. PURCHASE OF THIS PRINTER IS SAME AS PURCHASE OF ELEPHANT FOR PERSONAL USE !!!",1
"Dont buy this printer by mistake . Ink cartridges yield only 70-80 pages given with the printer . Buying new cartridge will cost u 1500 evry 1.5-2 months .. also u cant refill those cartridges , it doesnt work . I would never suggest this printer to anyone . Worst product .. dont buy a printer with ink cartridge . It will end up proving u way more expensive",1
"I am sorry to say that the Amazon is not helping me to replace the product, I know product is ok but it's not compatible to me and this can be fairly good to return it.

Kindly help me for the same",1
"i hardly took 20 prints in of black
and 5 prints of colour .. and now low cartidge indication is happening..
u people have given used cartidges.. how can cartidge finish in so less prints..better not to take this kind of printer
i have done a mistake i think by taking this printer",1
"I changed over from Canon to HP and was hesitant. However, the online folks really helped me set up the printer. Was still unable to use the wireless facility, so they promptly sent a representative home and he set it up in no time. Very happy with the product - can now directly print even from my mobile",5
"WORST, WORST, WORST PRINTER AND COMPANY. I am a person who has never spent so much time on writing a review. But I am forced to. The worst printer and the worst support I have ever received. Everyday I am spending so much time to resolve one or the other issue. Now I feel the only thing HP wants is all my personal details during set up, no help after that. It has given me problems only from the first day. It took so much time to install. Once installed, when I started taking print, the paper will reach halfway to the cartridge and then will show stuck. Everytime I have to turn off the printer and restart it to print the page. I need to repeat it after every sheet. It was resolved accidentally when my paper sheet was over and I purchased the best GSM paper from the market. Till that time, I did not receive any solution from Hp or from any other source. After that, when I was taking a print urgently, the margins of the printer never come properly as shown in the softcopy of the PDF. I took so many prints after changing the paper option to A4, letter and legal. Same results. Only after I changed the position of the paper and put it to one side of the tray, did the print come properly. First time I am encountering a printer, for which you can put paper in different positions in the tray for the print to come properly. Usually you put the paper in the up or down tray and the print comes properly. Now I am using another wifi, not the previous one. You can scan by connecting the USB cable, but it never prints. I checked multiple sites including HP help to change my wifi. I tried multiple suggestions given, but none works out. Also, I purchased a new black cartridge from Amazon online and connected it properly, but the cartridge status shows a red light. Dont know why. I have used printers in India and abroad, both laser and inkjet. HP printers were always notorious for installation, but never gave me this much trouble. Brother laser printers were always my best bet. But, since I needed this printer only for a short time, I purchased the less costly printer.",1
"Printer worked fine for the first few weeks, then suddenly it stopped working and required me to setup the printer again - when setting up the printer it requires you to use ""SETUP"" cartridges that come with the package, when I had to redo the setup even though I've used the ""SETUP"" cartridges which had worked and printed documents - the printer now does not recognise them and refuses to print anything. Now it's just an expensive piece of plastic sitting on my desk, complete waste of money. Even reached out to HP support but no resolution.",1
"The good thing about this mfd is that it's quite easy to install, pair up with your mobile wirelessly and take out good quality print outs very fast. Why then did I not give 5 stars? Well first of all all the buttons are touch sensitive buttons and not physical, which means that I cannot power it on just by feeling for the button as I will have to look for it( it's placed below my computer desk). Secondly I am still having some problems while making copies as a little of the top part gets cut off while printing a4 sized documents and lastly I wish they had it in black as white is very difficult to maintain as the heat generated by the printer attracts dust. But all in all it's a great printer.",4
Amazing Printer Cheapest Price Wirless,5
The printer comes with a faulty cartridge which cannot be replaced through the service center. The service center people would try to avoid any issues regarding cartridges. HP customer support and chat support are useless. They would try to fool you if you contact them. The Chat executive had asked me to contact Amazon regarding the Cartridge issue on an HP printer. No service personnel assistance for setting up the printer as promised in the Amazon ad. Color print is not 100 pages as promised it is less than that. Every time the Cartridge depletes you need to substitute with a new cartridge costing Rs 747.,1
"This is returned product by me. So can't right much on this.

1. As HP is the top most brand, the overall quality of this printer is good.
2. the mobile app and the installation of printer was much easier and value add features.
3. The print quality was OK (similar to Canon Printer in the same price range)

4. I had to return this because after 5-6 prints, its on of the fetching wheels (right side one) stopped working and then it started fetching the paper in tilted from right side.
5. I contacted customer care but they kept me waiting for 8-10 minutes without answering, then after tried 3-4 times calling them (every time I heard your wait time is 10 minutes, your call is important to us). Then I decided to return it back.

After this I purchased Canon Printer in similar range with same functionalities, which is working superb till the date.",3
"Anybody who is reading this please dont buy this printer. Never thought HP can cheat people like this. This printer has no both sides printing, still its ok if the print quality and ink usage was fine. We printer hardly 100 pages and cartridge was over. BY default it prints last page first and after every printout you have to go and change this option in properties. cant imagine HP is still selling such outdated and hopeless product.",1
"This Printer is very difficult to setup on a JioFiber router. Otherwise as well, my previous HP Wireless 3540 Series printer was much easier to setup on Wireless. This is just a crazy hassle, trying to connect through a SmartPhone. Please dont buy printers that have setup through a SmartPhone. It has crazy combination of buttons you have to press, to enable to Setup mode. The previous HP 3540 printer had clearly defined buttons that defined what was what.",1
Never buy this product or if someone is gifting it for free then too dont accept. The ink cartridge dried up the second day due you understand day 2. USELESS,1
"Be ready to buy refills of ink cartridge for every 10-12 prints. Absolutely hopeless printer. It consumes full ink for just 10-12 prints.

DO NOT BUY THIS DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.",1
It’s money down the drain. I’ve had the printer for two months and it’s been a frustrating mess. It’s constantly smeared ink on the document or had paper jams. It’s a terrible printer. Or perhaps I just received a faulty one. It’s been a battle with HP’s customer service to get any sort of help in the matter. We’re still waiting for a technician to call us.,1
"The cost of the product is amazingly cheap but when it comes to print quality (especially color ones) are pathetic. You would often see double lines/edges after you print it.
Since the initial unit cost is less, HP has covered it nicely by comprising on the cartridge life. You need to be prepared to buy new cartridge after every 30 pages of color prints. Which does not make it value for money, especially when a branded cartidge comes at 750+ INR.
I almost forgot to mention that you can't control the scanner from the mobile app. It simply doesn't support this model. The only thing you can do through this app is scan from mobile. It is not disgusting but rather a receiving product branding. Why would customer's use the app and th printer if they ultimately have to scan through the mobile? It is such a cheap business strategy and that's why HP sucks in Printing business and Cannon soars.
Hence my suggestion would be, shell out more money and go for Cannon Inktank printers. I have that one , it surpasses my expectations in terms of print quality and maintenance.",1
It is too automatized to troubleshoot. The HP support sucks.We do not have any troubleshooting help on the printer screen and the app errors are generic. Could get one page printed after wasting 3 days in troubleshooting. It again got stuck with another error the next day! Cannot return this anymore so stuck with this one,5
"Totally worth it. WiFi feature is the best, I can take printout from phone or laptop without connecting by wires.
Everything working as expected, scanner printer works smooth. But Ink cartridges are very expensive. I have put a picture printed in colorlok paper.
Anyone buying printers , never buy nonwifi printers, buy wifi printers only.",5
"it is so very complicated.. I had given up ... I downloaded windows 10 driver , deleted old hp printer , downloaded hp smart app , run the diagnostic test ... yet struggling to set up WiFi Buy a ordinary usb printer.. hp printer WiFi does not connect .. hp virtual guide is maha useless .. so I am using it with usb
I would like to add after using it , its expensive the cartridge .. its a White Elephant",1
"1. you can print directly from any machine / mobile connected to same network
2. you can also email an attachment to print from anywhere.
3. it is not necessary to always change network to print.
4. Mobile setup is easy, use HPeasystart setup from hp page to install in windows, if you messed up anything, use HP print and scan doctor

overall a good buy. For new bee like me initial setup could be a pain.",4
"Sometimes i feel good about it, sometimes i am not. Scanner quality is great, can be used for scanning documents or old photos as well. Print quality is great, but best for photo. Pages per cartridge is 50 for b/w and 10 for color prints.
Few things that makes me unhappy is that some times it gives print or copy in very small aspect ratio, i dont know why. Seems like a firmware issue.
Pages stucks sometimes while printing like 1/20 times. In scanning, it sometimes scans upside down like 2/5 times.
Cartridge purchase is worst, business model is so unethical that you have to pay 1200 for color cartridge which print only 10 pages. And black cartridge cost 800 which is able to print only 50 pages. Printing in home becomes super expensive.",2
"The print quality is alright for a home printer which is expected from hp. Even at this price point, there is no automatic duplex printing which is a shame and also means your paper cost will go up. The ink is not on the cheaper side and if you're going to print say more than 25 pages a month, you'll regret buying this.",3
"I like the below mentioned specifications.
1. Design and colour combination is fantastic.
2. It is a wireless printer and any one can print from their mobile devices using the HP smart app.
3. You can print (both colour and black) copy (both colour and black) scan through this printer.
4. You can also print from your laptop/desktop through the cable included in the package.
5. It is not too heavy.
6. Replacement of cartridges are too easy.
7. It is a value for money product with excellent design.
8. Printing is too fast.
Only negative side is, the cost of original HP cartridges are very high.
My overall opinion for this printer is excellent.",5
"The control panel needs more visibility. Every time a button is pressed for a function, a page gets printed related to the function, which is redundant, waste. The paper feed tray could have been placed forward, below the printout tray. Otherwise very compact design and good quality prints and scan. After 6 months usage. can say very finnicky printer, paper gets stuck too often. Even if catridges are not empty, printing stops.need to replace catridges.",5
paper feeding is an area of improvement . ALSO there should be an inbuilt incentive to return the cartridges when fresh cartridges are delivered like a credit shell which can be utilized for next purchase.the current process is too complicated.,4
"I’m in love with one. It’s a great product for basic use and not heavy use. I bought this for home use and for the price I got this for Amazon is a steal (around ₹3000) and it works wirelessly which I love the best. It makes my work easy. Printer and also the app comes very user friendly. Printer works great, scanner works great. Can’t expect anything more for that price",5
"It is not nearly as easy to install and use as it says. I have not been able to connect it to a JioFibre Wifi network.
I use the in-built HP wifi network. I can’t print using my phone connected to the internet because my phone has to be connected to the HP wifi and not to JioFibre.
I don’t know whether it is a restriction of JioFibre.",3
"Style name: HP DeskJet 2723 (Newer Model)Verified Purchase
Dont buy this printer by mistake . Ink cartridges yield only 70-80 pages given with the printer . Buying new cartridge will cost u 1500 evry 1.5-2 months .. also u cant refill those cartridges , it doesnt work . I would never suggest this printer to anyone . Worst product .. dont buy a printer with ink cartridge . It will end up proving u way more expensive",1
"I was surprise that how come the HP can be like this.
1. First of all to connect with wifi we need do lot of magic to play with it. I spent almost 2 hours to get a first print.
2. There is one app coming along with this to manage the printer and so and so. Finally we will end up spending hours to manage that software to get it connected.
3. Catridge was empty after 20 30 pages of black and white.

This is not at a Good quality product. Better you can go for another brand",1
"+ Printer is easy to operate
+ Low cost

- very high cost of printing, black cartridge got finish in appx 40-50 pages, and cost of cartridge Rs. 800 means 16-20 rupees per page
- makes noise while scanning
- software provided on CD are not have enough features for even basic scanning utilities or printing utilities
- i have to use a 3 party free software for scanning
- installation is somewhat complex, not just plug and play printer

MORAL - do not buy this or any other ink cartridge based printer, put some more money or EMI to buy a tank based ink printer for color or if only b/w needed, purchase base model of laser printer for your home or home-office",1
"Ordered for hp deskjet 2723, received hpdeskjet 2700 that too a defective piece whose print quality is very bad and looks like printer is very lazy took 1 min to print 1 page, also copying feature is not working",1
Just assembled and tried printing. HP smartapp is good guide for installation. Also needs HP plugin. Initial page settings was wrong unrealised later. Print is average quality and average time as compared to older HP models. Possibly settings have to be changed. Wireless printing is the best feature and very easy to use from mobile . Good for small number of prints at home.,4
"Original seal of hp not found on the box seems the box was open, material in box was not found as Factory packing, however the printer was covered and didnot found any damage, donot know anything is missing in it, any ways the printer is working fine",5
"It's a very nice product at really affordable price. Print quality is awesome, installation is hassle free(if you have used HP deskjet/color jet printer before then the installation is pretty basic like other HP printers), very easy to use, latest drivers can be downloaded from hp.com and all the instructions are there on screen while installing the drivers. So everyone can install it without dialing any number. Paper feeding is pretty basic like other desk jet printers, wireless works absolutely fine, there's some latency though but it's negligible. Scan quality is also good and the best part is it can be used both as wired or wireless printer choice is yours. I would say it's the best wireless printer at this price 👍",5
"Most irritating part is that sometimes it doesn't print after we give a print from Windows 10 Laptop.
Then on restarting the printer it start printing those prints.
Haven't tried that much from Mobile but until now it has printed every time I gave print from mobile app.
Good print quality for documents.
Average print quality for Color Photos.
Good only if usage is less, else it is irritating due to its slowness and issue of not printing every time we give a printout",3
"This is WORST printer, per print will cost you 30-40 RS.. The cartridge is highly expensive. Even REFILL does not work!!! Do not buy this printer.. NOT EVEN for RS 500

It is a waste of Money.... Buy some other printer like Brother or Samsung.",1
"No extra positive point over other printer-scanner.
First thing you need internet all the time for everything with this Printer.
You need to download the driver, which is free, but that does not work properly, most user unfriendly software.
Ink runs out just after 50 pages print.
You can't just just just just scan a piece of paper without internet.
Even if you provide everything to this piece of sh*t, even if the device showing ready with green mark, always shows ""Scanning is currently unavailable"".
No physical button for scanning, always need to run through software, which does not work.
Worst product and software by HP.
I tried contacting HP many time, none of their troubleshoot worked.",1
"Be warned that this printer sucks like big time. It's only been 10 days and I have started facing issues with it. The printer does not spool any paper and indicates that the paper gets jammed...

Feel like throwing this crap product in trash. NOT AT ALL WORTHY BUY.",1
"Purchased this HP DeskJet 2723 All in One Wireless Inkjet Printer on 14 February from Amazon.in. It was easy for setting and first printing and scanning. After the first experience the printer was constantly making printing errors paper jams, extreme slow network printing. I am using Wifi 2.4 GHz but the data transfer from PC to printer through Wi-Fi is extremely slow. Some times I need to spend half an hour to print a single sheet by multiple time restarting and connecting.
A non reliable product from HP...",1
"This printer has wasted my time. It is horrible to setup jn laptop and once the setup is done, instead of printing, it asks to setup again. I have never been able to print a document from laptop till date.

Each and every print requires multiple attempts. Finally, after struggling with it, I always end up at the xerox shop.
It prints the wifi direct password and information page using colour again and again. Most of my colour ink has been wasted because of that.
The HP Smart user interface needs a lottttt of improvement. It has very fixed controls like you can print only pdf files and photos. I cannot print my word docs and slides unless its converted to pdf.",1
"Installing it needs quite a patience. I had to watch couple of youtube videos to do it correctly. Its very cumbersome, took almost 90 minutes.
Post installation also it shows multiple errors about paper setting, cartridge settings etc , some days its a pain to use it",1
"Very expensive you can not take more than 100 print from 1 cartridge set
And cartridge is not easily available in market last 15 days i am looking and I got only 1 black and white colour cartridge is not available any where.",1
It's a great economy device to have for home use. Solves your frequent print scan and copy requirements. Its not heavy duty but just works fine. Truly wireless. Doesn't need any wire except power cable. I also test printed few 4X6 photographs on 200 GSM glossy photo paper. The quality is fine too. downside is its slightly slower like all other inkjet printers and gobbles up all the ink in cartigde quickly. Also no continuous copies or scans possible. You have to do it one by one.,4
Amazing product at such a low cost,5
"Just received the printer . Stunning fast delivery . Nicely packaged . 2 pager leaflet gives all the information with images for set up. Download hp smart app and keep wifi running and you can see everything happening on its own. Smart app has installation steps with videos. I am happy I can print anything from mobile. Test prints gave amazing quality for both color and b/w. Two cartridges comes with this. Easy installation , easy to use and great print quality . However, this is handy only for personal use and not for regular printing. Doesn’t seem economical. The cartridge shows only 3/4th now after one A4 photo color print . All in all I recommend this product for home use. God a good deal in sale too .",5
"Not convenient to feed paper. However, the most important part is the cost of cartridges - around 1700. The cartridge which come with printer do not last even 50 - 60 pages. Be prepared to shell out this much soon, if you buy this printer. Rest there is nothing special about the printer which is different from the information provided in description.",3
"This product is waste..it will not function properly. amazon not ready to return. its all gabling.

Please dont buy products from amazon. i call customer care 100 times, they never agree to return the product and they not customer friendly. You can buy products in trusted shops at least they will help you.",1
"It is so nice. Easy to use print quality is very good. I directly connect it to my phone buy WiFi. Hp smart app is also to good from their we can directly print. But their is not CD to download software. But their is not use of it you can directly connect it to your computer,laptop, or with your phone buy WiFi or hp smart app. USB cable is also given.... Xerox is also very clear and nice.",5
Product is good. One can print without having a laptop or computer. Bad is only that two wifi connection are needed and cartidge is expensive. Print quality is great.,5
"Hi couple of weeks back I bought this printer and started using for online studies.
hardly 30 prints after cartridge been over and checking online to purchase the same and find out that cartridge cost is more-than 1700 Rupees. which is the half price of this printer value.
i strongly suggest to new buyers Never Buy this model for one reason :-original new cartridge gives hardly 20 color prints , even black color prints as well. Print quality is VERY GOOD and BRIGHT.manufacture manual says 165 color prints ,it's NOT true ,they need to change this statement.",1
Umm not satisfied with this product it can only print 50-80 pages with it’s conpany provided inc cartirage.And it’s ink is too expensive.And sometime when i print it pull down 4-5 pages at same time.Very disappointing product now i have option to cancel it but i used it’s ink and refilled someother’s company’s ink i don’t think so the company will take it back.Please don’t buy this product wait till your budget goes to 6000-7000.,1
Useless after refilling ink. Faded prints after refill. U have to press the paper every time for each and every print. It cannot print without pressing the paper downwards. Dont buy dis is useless. Instead spend some more n buy a better one. Complete waste.,1
"I wasted my money in buying this product. First of all, print set up wirelessly not easy.I so far could not set up printer connecting through cable. Colour print quality is below standard. Not easy to set up size of print content before giving print command.Also , print speed is very slow.",1
"I would never recommend to buy this product. The inbuilt catridges will get exhausted after 50-70 pages of print and even though you buy new catridges you cannot refill them, and supposed to replace the catridge every time the ink exhausts which will costs you more than printing costs from any retail printing store.",1
"It is one of the least efficient devices i have ever seen! No issues with the device hardware and scanning mechanisms. But I'm not okay with the number of pages i can get for a cartridge A cartridge priced around Rs. 850 gives maximum of 40 to 50 pages print. That's it. For 100 pages of print should we spend around 1500+ Rupees for 2 cartridges??
As i mentioned earlier there are no issues with the printer hardware. It's absolutely genuine. But cartridges are ultra expensive!
Please think twice before buying this!!",2
The printer looks good and very easy to install but it's not very cost effective. The ink which came with the printer got over with just around 40 pages of print and each ink comes for around 600 INR so I don't think it's very cost effective. I am trying to get rid of this printer.,1
"Took about 3 or 4 tries to recognize my wifi - even when i placed it right next to the router. After setup, kept repeatedly making a hard sound and then alerted of paper jam, even without any paper set up. doesn't print - useless. trying to find how to get service and if not will have to return",2
The pathetic product ever I have used in my life .... we can only print one page at a time and the second page will stuck always ink consumption is very high pls don’t buy this product HP should call back such savage products from the market and Amazon should not provide their platform for such pathetic products... it’s a cheat,1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Cheap quality print .it only give u 20-25 prints with good quality after that cartridge will print blur pictures because of cartridge problem. And sometimes printer stop working and can't print until turn off and on again.",3
"Quick delivery, very well packaged. Installation was pretty easy. Install the app on the phone and follow the prompts to setup. Takes about less than 10 min to get it up and running. I just received it and print quality is decent. Can't speak about the cartridge life as it's too early. That's where usually the catch is. Changing cartridges frequently can be pricey and that's where they get you.",5
"Worst support system HP has its been almost more than 2 weeks I am asking for help in first installation of printer. No help till now. Support teams keeps asking same details every time and when it was assigned to technician, the tie up store says we don't support this printer.. for what fun I bought it paying 5k plus. Really frustrated",1
"Better than old 2132, 2135 models. This one has direct WiFi mode for easy printing from smartphone. I think it produce sharp and clear text than 2100 all-in-one series. For WiFi direct printing, you should install HP smart app and HP print plugin from playstore. I got it for Rs. 3999 from Appario Retail Private Ltd.",5
Got the product but missing the service up cartridges. How is a printer without cartridges helpful,3
interface app could be better and user friendly. sometimes we don't if its going to print or not. Wasted some 4-5 sheets on setting up - this can be avoided. Mobile app works better than the desktop set-up.,5
"The service is atrocious. The printer developed a problem. The local service centre says it will take over 10 days to rectify the problem. The HP call centre numbers given be servicego are wrong.
Never buy a HP printer online!",1
"Product is very good ,but the print cost very very high and ink cartridge is also very very very very high .please don't buy waste of money to buying ink cartridge",4
"the printer does not print at all sometime....after having taken the first print.
it is giving problems after the return window was closed....at first you send the print command. it does not print and then by default problem in it...it automatically sends the print on the first print command over and over again....and then the page keeps coming as blank.",1
"Got it at a great price in Amazon.. the brick & morter stores would not have all the HP models and would try & push the latest ones that will cost you double if not more..
I needed a handy, compact printer/scanner/copier for my home - day to day easy to use, plug & play.. this one meets the criteria quite well!",4
It is ok but don’t expect crisp image quality it fails in colour saturation it is ok in contrast but u need thik paper or your paper will be tissue and there will be issue. So sell your laptop to buy refills for this printer if u want to use it continuously for 1 year or sell your phone and don’t worry you still got your xerox slot 🤏🏻,4
"The product in general is excellent. It is superb in installation easiness and pricewise also much less, although the it does run out of ink pretty fast. I have purchased the 2621 in March and the within May the ink (Black) ran out, where as our consumption would have been barely 50 pages in 90 days. And, oh! boy, the cartilage is costly.",3
"Worth Product
Good print quality
Installation very easy
And anyone can use easily
If anyone want a printer then buy this...
Small issue is that cartridge is very expensive and ink capacity is very low, drain in few days.",5
"Extremely unsatisfied with the scanner cum wifi printer. Being an Amazon customer for so long, never expected to write review of this kind. The print quality is extremely bad. Not even a single photo got printed. Wifi get's trurned off very often. With in 6 months this printer becomes completely unusable. As I can't now return this item to Amazon by policy, I've to run here and there to catch HP to fixing it. Not sure if Amazon can help on this.",1
"Meets my expectations for the printer, wifi option is very handy. Print quality is good.. Only let down is no option for automatic double side printing.",4
The USB connecting wire and the user manual was missing!......It seems that it was assembled from somewhere else and packaged....There is no black ink....but grey.... Print quality not good.....,3
The printer is awesome. It super easy to remove printouts. Crystal clear and super quality. Loved it. Value for money.,5
Cartridge with printer was defective. Very difficult to get thru HP service center for cartridge warranty. After 4 to 5 tries on 18002587170 and waiting 15 to 20 mins HP gave a number belonging to one Mohan Warlikar 7710082139 which too was not working. I am not sure why they can't give there normal HP service center number instead of harassing public by giving a personal number,4
The printer came without the Amazon cover or box. It was neither printing not xeroxing. Called the hp technician who checked and showed me the yellow colour was missing from the colour Cartridge.seems the seller has sold a defective cartridge with the printer- do not buy it from this seller.,1
Value for money printer for occasional home use i.e less than 100 pages per month. It was easy to setup and works well for printing from mobile devices and laptops wireless from anywhere. You can also print from anywhere by simply emailing a document to your printer using our own personalized hpconnected email.,5
"I have bought this printer and was using it for many days..the printers quality is good, it takes time to print but the output is way more than expected.
Both the WiFi connectivity and USB connectivity is good..
This printer is very useful in home and small office purpose.",5
"Ok.
Installation brochure should be comprehensive",5
"Good product, but extremely expensive printing cost. The cartridge got over after 45-50 pages.. and each crateisge cost about 1000 rs.. I wish hp make a more efficient model..",2
Ok but cartridge costly n the one which comes printer is too less hp fleeces customer,4
"Printer is good in given price ., but with this kinda printer per print price goes too much higher ., so won’t recommend in that way",3
"Print quality is good, Design is excellent , cute looking printer, best for low usgae printing, not good for Heavy printing, only problem is cartridge ink, little difficult to refill, cartridges are expensive, otherwise a good printer for low use printing",4
"The printer is good,
Nice build quality,print quality. Easy to install,
Easy to use, sleek n elegant design. Plus it hp , can definitely trust",5
Ink printer is not good... they only promise you for good quality and good service but not.. dont go with ink printers.. copies are also not as per their saying.. you can only print max. 20prints it's too costly.. as well not in good quality.. after using 4months this is my review I have used 8 cartridges in 4months and print max 100prints only..,1
"In this product the ink of black and white is delivered half only
And the printer must print 500 to 600 pages but it only took 30 pages and stoped working
Pls make sure that the product is correctly measured..
And pls come to my address and solve the issue as much as possible....",3

 Got HP Deskjet 2621 instead of 2600... Ink costly... It finished fast. Showing outside HP Deskjet 2621.. inside label HP 2600😳",2
Color cartridge gets almost empty showing only one level printing only 45 pages consisting slight color articles. Whereas it claims that it can print about 165 pages. That's really disappointing and not expected.,2
"I received in unbelievable speed, the printer in less than 24hrs by Amazon. The printer was completely seal wrapped with polythene inside. Whole item was packed well. I have used it for a week, it's been satisfying. It's easy to use, it has got WiFi printing option , we don't need to connect everytime to PC or laptop.",5
Just printed some 20 black pages and the black cartridge is done!!. Too costly. Don't buy!!!,1
Just installed today for home use for kids daily worksheets & projects....it is pretty easy & quick to install....no hassles as of now....will update if anything....thanks,4
"The worst printer ever purchased. It skips papers automatically , prints faulty page numbers completely corrupted machine . I strongly recommend not to buy this sort of deskjet printers from HP",1
Worth buying and easy to use. Customer Care Executivbes are always there to remnder all help needed.,5
Print quality is great simple installation. Works with Android Mobile App! Rating 3star because the cartridge came along printer didn't even last for 30pages .The new cartridges are very expensive.,3
Before buying this I checked video.. clearly mentioned after delivery within 24 hours company person will come and install the printer..but still no one has come or calll... I m not satisfied with this kind of ...???,1
"In today’s age, can’t believe HP is selling a product of this quality. Print quality is bad. Print speed is horrible. Cartridge size is extremely small. Can print less than 30 pages in black. PLUS Amazon return policy is misleading. Don’t buy unless you want to waste money and time.",1
Print quality is super awesome... But usage of ink..😂😂😂.. And above all if you change your wi-fi password... Then try to reinstall... Mast..,2
although product mentioned on website is 2723 but inside the box it is 2700 model,4
Extremely poor. Installation is biggest problem. Follow all steps and it fails. USELESS. DO NOT BUY,1
"I used for one week it's ok but today I gave B&W print ,but total colour cme with that print and my colour cartridge became empty...( I only take 3 colour print from purchased) it's very worst experience..what is the problem ..iwant solutions",1
"Very nice product. Very good print quality. If you can watch a tutorial on YouTube how to refill the 805 cartridges that came with the printer, you'll save a lot of money.",5
One of the worst printers in the world. It doesnot support many tyoe of papers. Doen not print properly. Paper jamming is a regular problem. Dont buy it.,1
"Pathetic printer. Doesn’t print even 50 black and white page and cartridge cost is around 800.
Another issue is you give command for black and white print and you get green coloured print. Initially I thought this could be because of installation or trial cartridge they have sent and I missed the return window.",1
There is a.fundamental defect in this NFL Printer. Also there is no way to check out the print A OR to delete a file from printing It's speed is just one a day. So it's not worth the money.,2
"This product has no complaints to talk about, worthy product at this price having features like scan and print over wifi. It came intact with the proper packaging.But if the wifi network is down prints can't be taken for this reason I wish it had bluetooth feature as well.",4
"The cartridge got over very fast and the print quality is also not good. Also, I am still not able to figure out the wifi",1
"This is definitely not a worthy purchase, the printer is drinking ink , you should buy cartridges for 1700 rupees after printing less than 50 pages , but hp claims 165 colour pages, I am returning this because the colour cartridges was half empty after taking 6 printouts!!! , I am going for ink tank printer",3
"Don't buy as it's operational costs are very high. Although company says the costs per page, but customer don't give attention to that. Very dissatisfied.. what to exchange but no mean:(",5
Plastic quality is low however it does the job as u won’t be moving or relocating it frequently cause it has wireless connectivity. Printing is gods and dose the job quite well.,5
"Absolute trash printer. Various issues all the time, paper mismatch issues for no reason where there is only one size, connectivity issues all the time, only 1/4th size of paper gets printed. NEVER PURCHASE THE 2700's model.",1
I returned they told it will work with voice control (using alexa and Google assistant) but it won't works. There is very poor response from hp customer care even they also don't know how its work with alexa.,1
"Not good. Worst of Money. I brought RS 5350. But next week price was 4799. I lost over 551.
Voter ID & Pan cards not xeroxable. But plan paper good xerox. Ink price so high. Not business use. I lost my money to brought this printer.",1
"Ever since the printer was ordered, there's been an issue. It does not print and keeps giving a size mismatch error. I've been in touch with HP customer service for the last 2 weeks and the issue still hasn't been resolved. Very disappointing HP!",2
"The printer is good, you can get clear printouts. WiFi is also working very well, but it’s printing cost is high so buy it only if you have occasional use as I have bought it for my home use only.",4
Never buy inkjet printer. Initially it is cost efficient but you will be bankrupt by changing catridge on weekly basis. It hardly print 20-25 pages and catridges will be empty. The catridge cost more than ₹800/-,1
This is good printer to be used at home. Easy to use and install. Print quality is good. But the cartridge is expensive. Not for heavy printing. The seller should provide a cover also.,4
Well delivered. Suggest if hp support can come and install and make us understand the process .. of print scan and copies ..thru laptop or mobile ..trial &error will make this happen .. but experience may not be good ..,5
"The ink did not even last for 3 print outs. The color print comes out in sepia color meaning reddish print, normal colors are not printing and the ink runs out in 3 days, both color and black ink. Worst printer that I have used. If possible will give it zero stars.",1
"Printing is very slow & getting paper jammed frequently. Also I'd hardly took 3/4 color prints and getting error that cartridges' empty now..
and now again I've to buy new cartridges' worth 1500 approx.?",1
"Very less pages output. Cost of Cartridge Rs.750 and no of pages you print is 150 that will cost around 300 outside. So no point in buying this printer
Also cartridge for this model is not easily available.. Most of the times its out of stock.",1
"Cost of this printer is near 4k and it only provides sample cartage will only print 30-40 pages , and onward you have to purchase the cartage's and every time it will cost you approx 2k.

So be careful before purchase.",2
"Very happy with the purchase after so many R&D, found a perfect all in one printer for personal use.",5
"Used cartridge., the cartage was either used or it was empty. I was able to print only 10 to 12 color pages and while black and white so far I have extracted only 15 pages.",2
"This printer use Colour ink for Black print as well. Also, cost per print mentioned on the product page is 50% of actual cost. Cartridges come along with products are only for 20-30 pages. so you need to replace them very quickly. This product has very high maintanence cost",1
"I have been having paper size mismatch errors and I am just going round and round in circles with the support. It's a damn A4 print. It's not some complicated affair. Good Lord, I am so frustrated. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!!!",1
"Good printer considering the price but have disadvantage of replacing ink cartridges quite often, that’s why it’s cheaper than other type of printer. Other than this satisfied with product.",3
It work perfectly. I loved the product and things got easier with the HP Smart app for printing wireless.,4
"The printer clogs pages in it, never ever buy this printer. I tried for 40 minutes and could not get a single page print due to repeated clogging of papers. Wasted about 10 pages without getting a single page of print.",1

"Good value for money,but cartridge for this printer are extremely costly and difficult to get from open market.even on HP store most of the time it is unavailable.",4
"Value for money. Can print from anywhere. Need a good high speed internet connection for playing with wireless printing.
HP Smart app can be improved.",5
"Product on opening is 2700 instead of 2723 model. Not sure why do.
Ink finished after printing 50 pages. No option to do anything. Better to buy from shop ad they have all these information",1

inspite of following the instructions the printer has frequent jams and does not print when given and prints sometime later which is quiet annoying.,3

The cartridges could not print much pages....seems ink was less in them....I got only 50 pages and black cartridge showed low ink,3

Not so bad. It's very little contain may be. Very soon finished.,3

WIFI STRENGTH and wifi direct option are working good. It comes with HP 803 BOTH BLACK AND TRI COLOUR CATRIDGE. VALUE FOR MONEY SURE.,4
The color don't come out well. Called the customer care several times and provided actual prints snapshot but the technical team is not equipped with professional printing expertise to solve the issue. Very unfortunate!,4
Good printing quality and worth for money for home use only not for commercial or corporate use,5
"Useless printer, never go for this, the per page printing cost comes around Rs.7, only 120 page per cartridge, now I am looking replacing this with some other printers",1

"Print quality is ok colour prints are not that great, cartridge gets over taking around 50 to 60 copies in black n white and worst for color please don't purchase this printer who has to do lot of printout work. Refill cartridge is also costly for this amount of prints. I would resell this for half the cost also not worth for money.",2
"Its quite an easy plug and play printer.
Color prints are quite decent in terms of quality, and can connect to any device that has a wifi capability to print and scan using the hp app.
Works well as an independent device and the ink usage is a bit reasonable for an inkjet printer",4
"Received the printer in good packaging and was delivered on time. It was not an easy printer to install.
However after installing the device, all the prints including the test prints for alignment etc all came faulty.
Tried taking multiple prints all came faulty. (Pics Attached).",1
"Very compact fits nicely in a small computer cabinet. Highly satisfied with the print and scanning quality. The option of wifi printing works effortlessly and makes your job much much easier. Very good product, value for money. Only downside is the toner runs out faster due to the high quality prints.",5
"Very good and very easy to install. Connected laptop via usb cable and also independently through Wi-Fi. Also connected Android and iPhone over Wi-Fi. No issues. Good quality prints, print and scan speed also good for home and small office use. Delivery well before time.",5
Hardly print 60 pages wrong information quote by company,1
when i was printing it is coming some late process and the ink was finishing quickly,3

"Black cartridge is totally empty .

"Opened the box, removed all the protective pieces and loaded the cartridges, voila, it worked. configured AirPrint and worked in 1st attempt. Easy to setup, easier to use.",5
"If you are Going to buy this printed for afordable printing then don't buy it
Can only print 20black and 12 colour apge per cartige which comes with it also
The cartige 803 is also very expensive I recommend to invest more and buy either inktank or laser printer starting from 8000
In other sense great products but didint like it as first time the scaber was damged then when the replacement came the package was damged so I retired it fully
Thank
Have a good day",4
"Printer looks good, light weight and easy to port around and plug in. Thats where the pros ends.
All the functions to setup the printer are complex and is not clear from the manual. There are multiple buttons to be pressed for any function, and combinations are not easy to remember. I finally got it setup in 2 hours. Where it still didn't connect to wifi. I was able to use wifi-direct option for first time, so i was still hoping it will get easy to use after a time. However, next time, printer was not working at all, not even via wifi-direct. I finally gave up and returned it.",2
"HP printers are really horrible, They don't even last and their cartridges are very expensive. My first printer spoilt within a day, and later exchanged. But cartridges did not last long. To exchange it took a long time and I bought second one 3835 thinking it will be better. But later this printer also spoilt as soon as first cartridge got over. Please do not waste money on these products. The overheads are very high.",2

"Printer is very easy to setup.
Connects from any of your device's and you can print from anywhere in your house.
Print per sheet works expensive if you want to use it for office",4
Don’t buy inkjet anymore. For long run to save money on cartridges of these cheap inkjet printers better buy laser jet printer amounting to 15k and save a lot on print cartridges.,1
"I have used it for around a month and im finding it easy to use with great printing quality. The printing speed is a bit less but it doesn't feel much for home use. The wireless feature is absolutely great . Easy to use.

Cons
The back tray is bit rough n tight for putting papers.
Sometimes paper doesnt get rolled and it folds. It haopens on putting 2_3 papers only.
Overall its 4.5 out of 5.",4

"HP is cheating everyone, i have buy a WIFI printer and after 10 days printer stop working then HP saying you need to buy a new cartridge price 1000 rupees and we will not change it .",1
Writing this review after 2-3 months of purchase. Pathetic printer and on top of it pathetic hp customer care team. Dont buy this product. It will take ages to connect to with wifi and by chance you change your network and ask hp customer care for help... Trust me you will curse urself,1
Nice and ease to use best but I connection problem,5

Both Black and color print quality is just awesome . What a printer it is ! It's quality is just awesome . Both color and black and white . ...... So purchase this and enjoy . You can see my review at my channel ELECTRIC REVIEW . Thanks,5
Though the printing speed is not excellent but it is perfect for students who print out on regular basis.Easy setup and print quality is also good.,5
"This printer is fast, it prints real quick. Photo printing is also quite decent.
I have tried it on Linux and Windows, both work, Linux however always prints in color even if settings are in grayscale.
The ink leaks though from bottom, after that paper comes blotched on the edges.
I am ok with it as my printing is not mission critical.
I would suggest for a couple of thousand more, now you can get wireless inktank auto duplex printers in canon, in case you like more convenience.
Overall an average normie printer for the average joe.",3
"After unpacking and installation, it was not printing , raised a complaint with HP support who said that it’s a hardware issue and the service engineer will be sent to review the same. The engineer was very knowledgable , and he said the issue was owing to a connection that would probably not have been made inside , and he opened the printer and he was so right. The printer is working all well .",4
"Letter size of below 9 is not printing properly, print as double or mirror type, which is not readable. So some PDF file can't print due to its small size of letter. Otherwise for 10 or above 10 size letter, it is good.",2
"Printer is very good. But recieved printer with ink already filled in printer and print head already seal broken and installed in printer. The ink bottles were leaking and ink was all over the printer and booklet, instruction manuals. I don't know if it's replacement printer or old piece. After plugin it is working smooth and producing good color. As the printer is ok n running am not returning but definitely wants to give one star to the seller.",3
"Initially the printer worked fine. But issue started after 2 weeks, once the return period was over.

1. Issue related to paper handling. The printer was unable to pull paper properly from input tray, resulting in no printing and paper error. Seemingly the paper pulling roller was not able to make contact properly on the paper and hence not pulling it.
2. Then trying to print a test page from HP printer utility, it did not print. Tried multiple times, no luck. As per the printer utility program, if test page do not print, it means that the printer is malfunctioning!

Not expected from a new printer from reputed company like HP. Seems a loss of Rs. 7600/-.",1
"Good printer for value for money, good quality and value for money, cartridges are not jaming for seldom use..i use it rarely 1-2 time in a month, still working.
Amazon did not provide full detail like product and serial number,i am struggling for warranty claim. the serial number provided is not working. also there is no product number on printer. waiting for amazon response..
cons: printer is very very slow. in urgency you will get frustrated and will go to shop for print because it can take several minutes sometime to adjust and print so in urgency it can kill your plan.....",4
If u are looking for very rare use and ink tank and low cost printing.this is best. Just compare canon 1010 and Epson 130,5
"Such a nice product let us see it's all good working,!!adding after using...

Best in this category and price as well..... forgot all BV colour printers and be the fan of hp115...g.. great performance and reliability as well!!!",5
"HP customer service suks so bad , they bluntly said that they dont provide installation service for this model whereas it is mentioned in product video description that installation is provided by HP brand.

Couldn't install it properly and couldn't take a single print.

Had to return it on same day , thanks to Amazon A class service for accepting the return for this thrash from HP.

P.S HP service sux better to go for any other brand other than HP",1
"Had been facing issues aince day 1.
Firstly the power button started blinking even though ink levels were sufficient and print heads were properly installed.
Then one day when i had to recheck and reinstall the printheads it just won't lock even if i press the blue latch. HP is also denying it to be a manufacturing issue and hence not covered under warranty. I think the seller has to own up else amazon must own responsibly for keeping this defective pieces on their market.",1
"Wanted printer for occasional printing for school work. Fits right for my expectation. Good quality print.
Also printed some photos which turned out be good, though not that good.
Didn't need any wifi feature, it takes just a second to connect USB wire, spending 2000 more for this feature does not make sense. Also, no need for photocopy as one as always take a photo and print any document.

Will update the review after few months",5
"Review (April 2021): I contacted the helpline (1800 number) and they gave me the contact for technical helpline, which is another 1800 number. The technical support engineer spent almost 30mins in call with me to find out the problem in my printer. We found two issues: (a) the paper feeder needed some cleaning, which was easy to clean with a cotton cloth wrapped in pencil sprayed with some sanitizer (b) the black printer head wasn't functioning at all. So, I was given a free visit to my door step the next day where the technician changed my black printer head for free. The reason for printer head to not function earlier was because the printer wasn't used every week to print and the printer head nozzle got ink clotted. Replacing the printer head solved the problem. I was able to print good quality prints after this. So 5 star rating for hp support and warranty coverage. Amazing job!

Review (march 2021): Prints look terrible, if you stop using printer for 2 months - Unable to fix with diagnostic tools. I don't know if ink is getting dry. The hp diagnostic tool says that the ink is not genuine. But I only used hp ink since the purchase time *(aug 2020) and I have hardly done 100 pages of print during these many months with 10 photo prints. I am unable to fix the problem.

Purchase-time Review (Aug 2020): Print quality is better if you keep printing more often. If you hardly print on daily basis, occasional printouts doesn't look perfect. You have to keep using hp software to clean the head before prints.",4
"I thought it is good printer with less speed that's all but I was wrong, it is below average, very slow and not reliable. You can't use paper more than 100 gsm. Though print quality is good till now. Paper pulling mechanism is poorly built.",3
"I purchased hp115 ink tank printer, for 5499 in amazon , printer prints quality below average i print 200 pages all the pages are not good , i change the cartridges also but print quality not change b/w is better than color print. If you want to but this printer choose another printer ..its only low cost to buy ......",3
"Not able to start, power is not switching ON. It's been over month. They keep on telling do this do that on WhatsApp. But not willing to send technician. Please do the needful or replace faulty printer.",1
"Useless printer.
Impossible to take bothside printing. Print quality is good. But it has a paper jamming problem. Paper stuck almost every time if you want to take 8-10 pages printout which makes it useless printer.
I'd not recommend to buy. Go for some better option.",1
"Printer is good
But i found the product delivered to me has already been registered for warranty and only 7 months are remaining",1
First of all its the cheapest available Ink tank option on the market. It does the job pretty well. The setup takes a while beyind that its a breeze. Have printed 100s of pages in past 3 months including photos and looks like it sill has ink left... very economical option and certainly a must have if someone is in the market for a printer that just does what it is supposed to do.,5
"Awesome for economical printing.

Best for home and small office use. Printing speed is moderate when printing @300 dpi and low speed for max dpi prints/ photos.

Got 2000 prints as of now. Ink lasts for 3000 prints as per current rate.

Best if you don't want additional features like scanning n wifi.

Go for it!!",5
"Been using for 4 months as of now, print quality is very nice (Black & white as well as color prints), Installation was hassle free, in between did not use it for more than 20 days, after giving print lines appeared but after doing cleaning with HP software Voila! it started working perfectly.

Delivery came on time, Packaging was very nice.

Go for it.",5
"Delivered the printer on 6 June,afternoon, I've checked all installation manual even in youtube and followed the instructions,the cartridge was well installed but the paper feeding roller does not work and inside it does not feed in and print it..",1
"Good printer, scanner is not there but now a days it's easy to scan any doc quickly and print it. Print quality is very good, easy to operate and best part is that running cost is very law. Black printing appx 10 to 12 paisa and colour 18 to 20 paisa and paper cost extra 40 -50 paisa.
Thanks",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The Packaged arrived in a very poor condition.
Packets inside the container were open.
The ink tank was already filled
The ink bottles were empty.
It couldn't even take the sample print.

Back side socket of plugin dock is got loose within the just 12 days.,1
"Received printer today and called HP support. Followed steps she told and found that power inlet is moving up and down. Doesn't seem right and I let her know about it. Further setup was done under her guidance, all required software installed. Printer powers up, but doesn't work . Complaint filed. Once again precious time lost.",1
"Online classes in the entire country = bus printer demand. HP removed all discounts, printers are being sold at mrp. Very bad unethical practice.",1
"I already have another brands wireless ink tank printer and was looking for a cheaper printer. Got this one as only printing was the sole purpose. Definitely a good buy if scanner functionality is not important.
Only drawback is that there is wireless option.",5
I am unable to write this review at the moment because a printer is not even working this particular printer does not come under HPs fitting options that means they will not send somebody from their team to come and setup the printer you have to do it yourself the instructions for setting up the printer and not very complicated they can be done on their own but if there is any issue after setting up HP is not very helpful with it.,1
"I purchased in July 2020. But my warranty is till Feb 2021 which start from 2019 as per HP (OEM) website. Therefore, effectively you are receiving lesser warranty period.",3
"Very cost effective and good b/w print quality...
For color photos print one need to be spend time in selecting settings and paper quality matters alot.
Overall a very good product around ₹6k. Have been using it for last 2 months...",4
Good. Once the paper got stuck. Color printing is damn slow and not that great print. Got it at 4899,4
"It's a good purchase. This printer is great if you are looking for a single function ie printing, printer. Any layman can install it since manuals and first set up tutorial videos are readily available.",5
Value for Money. Good print quality. No ink spill while filling. I personally think it is better than costly catridge based printers.,5
"Really like the product. In case interested in printing only can go for this product as the printing cost is low, quality is good.",5
"It is not up to the mark. Very poor quality printing. Not at all advisable for students. Plz do not purchase it.

Overall it is a waste product. Not worthy.",1
"good picture quality,easy to use",5
"Unable to use it. There was no installation CD in the package

"I had a bit of problem while installing the cartridge, but I got through somehow... The print quality is great and I am happy with the purchase. No pages were included with the printer so I had to purchase it from local stationery shop, for printer testing.",5

"No Rubust Enough, Gets Little hang during the print of more than 10 pages. Don't know about other brands but it is quite slow when we have to print more than 20 pages in one command.

"There was no outer Amazon branded carton used and the product was directly shipped in its original packing of Hewlett Packard. Printer was received in ok condition and is working as described. We got it for 7499. There is no other inktank from any other reputed house in this range. It works well but still love our Canon Pixima G2000. Device deserves a 5 star but we still feel that it's not very well built like few other models we are using. There is no issue with the functioning of printer. We printed almost 100 pages continuously (both colour and black n white) in one hour and it passed the test with excellent marks.

Those who are buying an inktank type for the first time should definitely go for it without any doubt.",5

"Didn't expect cannon to dispatch items without quality checks!
The colour head was not working properly from day 1.
Tried all software based ink flushing techniques, the ink totally flushed out and the colour stopped working there on..
Ordered new head- Rs 3500/-
Within 2 days, the led blinking indications started coming.decorded the code online and found it's an error which only service centre people can do. The ink drain was full.
After a week, the printer is not powering on itself!!
Service charge + replacement of printer board..Rs 5000/-
Warranty not applicable on these sections..
Had a great Cannon experience..",2
"I opted to buy this printer over Epson or Brother or any other company becuase of 2 reason. 1. Price (same features model with wireless costed 3k more for Epson) and 2. this Supports Borderless printing from 4x6 size upto A4 size. meaning you don't need to cut of edges after printing as her wont be any borders, The Utility software along with the package is quite good. i used it to scan and print wirelessly and it worked like a charm. wireless connection is very stable. i bought this for 8500 for Great Indian Sale. it comes with 2 extra black and white ink bottles so its 18k black and prints out of the box! so if you compare it with printing cost outside it straightaway negates the printer costs. overall a great buy! printed some color photos in glossy papers and it was fairly good. exceeded my expectations.
NB: about seller and Amzon service. i have had a problem delivery of printer since they where flooded with deliveries during great indian sale, which never used to happen with amazon. but they sorted out everything quickly and made sure i receive it. So Kudos to Amazon Service.. Cheers!",5
"The printer was easy to set up and use the Wifi direct paired to my phone. The app needs to be installed which isnt the best in UI but does the job.
One odd thing i found (check pics) is that color inks werent upto the top arrow mark like the black ink. I'm not sure why bcoz i emptied the entire bottle into the tank. The color prints have not come out bright and they look a bit dull. Was expecting better print quality on white 75gsm paper. Black prints are quite good.

Update:
The photo print quality on 200gsm kodak 6x4 is quite good. Higher quality paper would also give good results. The speed of printing is impressive and no washout or anything observed. After printing 4 pics, the ink level is the same.",4
"Chose canon over others due to its mega reputation and Classy size & shape.Its all-in-one ability supersedes all contemporary brands.

Here are my few observations of the product :

1.) Its an ink tank printer that comes with separate ink tanks to be filled with ink red , yellow , blue & black .Its always considered to be more economical for per page printing and should be chosen if you have bulk work on a routine basis.

In these ink tank printers, it is also required to take prints on a minimum weekly basis or prolonged non-usage may lead to drying of heads .

2.) The construction of the printer is very elegant and solid and the ink tanks are absorbed in the regular chassis of the printer unlike HP brand, however it is my personal preference.

Solid doesn't mean you can afford to drop it , it means the plastic used for construction feels very premium and rigid.

3.) Regarding functionality - It can scan and print documents very fast .Page size supported is from 4.0""x 6.0"" photo paper to A4 ,Letter ,Legal , A5 , B5 .

I purchased glossy kodak photo papers 280 GSM & paperone A4 100 GSM papers and the print quality was excellent.

For pictures , it takes few minutes but its worth the wait .If you choose the right paper the photos are bound to be very good ,However at few places i found the shade of green slightly dark in print than in actual photo that was scanned.

Resolution is good for both photos and documents.

Printing makes slight noise but is tolerable , its not like neighbour or even other room person will be disturbed.

4.) Got it with additional warranty for onsite repair for next 2 years.

5.) I bought it first then realized i don't have that much work to use it on daily basis so i would ask my readers to buy only if you have routine works or make use of shops.",5
"I am writing this review on this printer after using it for over a year. In this year, I printed about 2000+ pages both color and black&white. So my review is based on observations on them.

=== Print Quality ===
This is definitely the brightest point with this printer. I used Epson ink tank printer earlier and were not satisfied with the results of it. But this Canon printer makes the cut. I am amazed to see the results of the printing both color and B&W. I printed many photos on photo papers and the results were better than the inkjet printers.

=== Ink Longevity ===
This is another biggest selling point of this printer. The printer came with 4 ink bottles - Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow. After printing over 2000 pages so far (photos and documents) I still see 50% of the ink left.

=== Ease of Use ===
I can connect this to my wifi router and get started in 5 minutes. All I need is to read the instructions carefully. And voila, all my devices - Computer, Laptop, Mobile and iPad - can print without any hassles. They can detect the printer and starts printing just in minute.

=== Paper Feeding ===
In my more than one year experience with this printer, I never faced a single paper jam. If at all something happens, check paper feeder if any small objects stuck accidentally.

=== Scanner ===
Not used much but overall quality was ok. If you want crystal clear scans, this is not for you.

=== Copier ===
Its just a click of button. Keep your document inside the scanner and click on blabk or color button. Your document copy is ready.

=== Issues ===
So far I came across only one issue. The printer orange light starts blinking and the messages shows that the ink cleaner bed was overflown and needs a service. But I followed the instructions on Youtube videos, cleaned the ink cleaning bed and cartridges for 4 to 5 times and then the printer came back to normal. But this took over 4 hours to understand and solve the issue.

=== Advice ===
1. Do not perform system cleaning too many times. This will cause overflowing of tank on ink cleaner bed and malfunction your primter.
2. Do not use cheap paper, use paper such as JK Sparkle etc.
3. Do not print photo prints on normal paper, use photo paper or thick paper.
4. Make sure to print few papers at least once a week with all colors. This will reduce color logging inside the tubes.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this printer and the quality of prints it gives you.

Update 11/11/19
I faced one more issue after long time. The printer unable to feed the paper and I couldn't find any object inside the feed. After two days of struggling I came up with an idea of reverse feeding the paper from inside the printer, i.e. open the top box to see printer inside and switch off and onthe printer. While stopping, it reverses spinning wheel and load paper manually to it just in time. Voila, it started.",5
"The printer head has failed after about 1 year due to ink caking. While I can agree that ink caking can happen with less frequent use, I would prefer a model where issues due to ink caking/ drying can be resolved with servicing rather than having to replace the entire printer head - cost about Rs.4000+18%GST!",1
"Printer stopped working in exactly 2 months. Is throwing errors. Calling tech support for 2 weeks and no one seems to be bothered. Canon Support specializes in lying through their teeth and making false commitments of arranging a technician visit in 24 hours, which never happens.",1
"Very Expensive Ink from Canon, Printer already stopped working within 6 months
It never worked properly since day one, Had to follow all troubleshooting before every print
If used with any other Ink from Amazon then the printer stops working with Error Code: 5B00",1
"The printer is smooth and the printing quality is nice.
Don't find any difficulty with installation (Followed the installation steps from youtube)
There are 2 issues:
1. The printing speed via WIFI/SELPHY APP is very slow, my wifi connectivity is good. Seems the issue persists with printer data receiver.
2. While installation/Initial Head setup, printer has consumed more ink from YELLOW tank. Almost 1/4 of the ink was gone during installation. But afterwards the ink usage looks normal..",4
"After using the product for a few days one day when I turned it on to do a print the error light and the power were flashing in alternation. usually when I turn on the printer it makes some noise. the head moves back and forth, and it sets things up for a print. This time there was no sound and only the lights flashing. upon checking it showed up as error B202. which requires you to call cannon and ask for a repairs. I was surprised to see this. the printer is just a few days old.

I tried turning it on and off a few times but it didn't work. then I pulled the plug, reinserted the plug and powered it on. and finally this time it made it noises and started setting itself up. I could use the printer for the rest of the day with out trouble.

but then the next day they happened again..

and then the day after this happened again.

I'm quite upset with this product. remaining all functions and print quality is great for office use. but if the printer doesn't work then nothing else matters. id like to return this product but unfortunately I've crossed the return window.

Im not sure what to do but to contact cannon now.",1
"I bought the product at a steal value, which is good.

Although I was aware that there is no LCD screen to guide me thorough the menus, my geekiness will support me, I was sure.

Installation with my computer via WiFi router was pretty easy. Did a few tries to locate the printer on my network and tried the button shortcuts and finally got it connected.

Prints were good. Ink seems to be drained a lot as 3 prints on, I could see about 15 percent drop in the ink levels. Need to ascertain it in the long duration.

Now comes the tricky part. I wanted to connect it to my phone and another phone not on my WiFi router network. I installed the Canon ""Print"" app and it was not detecting my printer.

I tried detecting WiFi direct devices but was not able to see the printer. After a few tries with the button shortcuts, I was able to locate it in the regular WiFi devices. I connected to the WiFi printer and was able to at least connect the phone to the printer directly. Prints and scans were again possible.

Then came the real headache. The printer was not getting detected by the computer now. By some unknown reasons, this printer is not able to connect to both services, WiFi direct (act as hotspot) and regular WiFi (access a hotspot) simultaneously.

My previous WiFi MFD, a 5000 rupee HP was easier to install, easier to understand and connect and had none of the aforementioned WiFi issues!

I called up the Canon customer care (18002083366) on Saturday and raised a service request. service guy will visit my in 24 hours, I was told. Come Tuesday, I still didn't get the service call atleast.

I gave them a call on Tuesday morning and reiterated the issue. They gave me a local service number. After a few hours, I got a call and I had to tell them the whole story again. Second installation is not free, I was told. I said that the first installation was done by myself. They agreed to come by evening.

Evening they gave excuses that they were caught up with other customers and don't even have the courtesy to lift my phone. I'm still waiting. Will update after they actual arrive. I just hope the service rep has better skills than myself.

I'm pretty sure it's not an issue which can be sorted out onsite. There might be shop servicing needed. I should have gone with Amazon return as I'm still within that period. But I'm being a gentleman, for now.

Update : Gentleman's patience broke. I got a replacement. Problem persists another way.
I realised my 12k Canon printer can only act as either a wifi-direct printer or can access an external WiFi router, but cannot do both, like my 5k HP printer.
The technicians reply made it clear. Sir, canon doesn't have any models in the sub-15k range which can be accessed by laptops vide wifi router and at the same time by accessed by phones vide wifi Direct! Thumbs down.

The printer however served its purpose of printing well in standard and best modes. Draft mode had lines showing up on an otherwise splendid photo.

Another irritating problem with this device is the scanning application. Competitors need to learn from HP. Their scanning apps were so user friendly. This one in yet to find easy ways to scan proud or documents readily with my required settings by default. Not at all user friendly. Instead it pops up like some irritating ads we get online!

Overall, this is an ok device for the rate. The only saving grace are the ciss, which for now works great and the decent print quality for standard and best modes. So far so good.",3
"1) Print quality is good. 4.5/5
2) But it is too noisy. 1/5
3) Software need to be more user-friendly. 3/5
Setup is easy: 4.5/5
4) Windows app and MAC OS apps are different a bit. MAC version can be improved.
5) Scan quality is not at getting best. Widows app has better resolution options to get better quality Scan.: 3.5/5
6) Copy works good, for home use with limited copy requirements: 4/5
7) Over all easy setting up of printer, including ink and other parts. A person with limited knowledge can install it with ease, without expert support. Printer help doc can be improved though. 4/5",4
"The delivery was excellent and reached on the next day. The contents of the packing includes, 3 black ink bottles, 3 color ink bottles (1 of each color), printer, manual with CD. Everything needed, and the installation was quite simple, apart from getting it connected to the WiFi. You will have to insert the CD and follow the process, to get it connected to the WiFi, which could be a little tricky.

Once the installation is complete, it is a very easy to connect to it if the device is on the same network. I haven't tried WiFi direct, so can't review about it.

Speaking about the print quality, it is excellent. Keep in mind the quality of the paper, the quality of the source image and the App you use of printing makes a world of differences. I tried printing pictures on a Kodak Glossy paper using my phone and cannon printer app, the quality was not as much as I expected. Was a little disappointed, but when I used GIMP ( a free photo editing app ) on windows and selected the right size of the paper. The print quality was awesome.

Document printing and Scanning is perfect, you can print through any app, even using mobile the quality is awesome.

Overall a perfect product of printing at cheap rate and great quality.",5
"Print colur looking different with compare to epson color printer. Too much noice while printing, and very difficult to connect wifi with laptop. too much of noice coming when take a print out.",3
This is the best thing ever bought on Amazon. The print quality is good and it's very easy to install and use. It is printed about 3000 copies and yet it still printing.I recommend this to all the people who are looking for an economy printing solution. And not only printing it also is very quick in scanning and xerox.so I would like to give 9.9 out of 10 to this.don't think much if you want to buy this simply this .I take the guarantee,5
"This is not a good printer.

First, it has issues with MAC. Installation is painful.

Then it has a special app that you need to use on mobile phone.

Then it just flat out doesn't work with Linux.

Then setting up wifi printing is painful.

Just walk away pal.

And oh, darker images have parallel lines through out the page.
And also, it cannot duplex print from Mac or Linux or Android (not sure about Windows). I think its hardware cannot support.
And also, scanner generates potato quality scans.

Just bad! Money loss.",1
"Got it on sale, so paid much lesser than the original price.

Pros:
1. Ink tank printers are money savers in the long run and work for longer as well.
2. Premium body finish and look
3. WiFi connectivity is the best thing you can go for, its future proof. If its linked on your router, you can print documents from any corner of the room via any device without having to go the printer. Even desktops dont need a cable to connect cause it prints via the local network so you can place the printer anywhere and use it flawlessly.
4. You get additional black ink bottles which is a plus point.
5. Lower maintenance needed than other printers.
6. Borderless printing is great.
7. Atleast 2 prints within a week is important to ensure the printer works at its full potential. Also, if printing is not possible, atleast switch on the printer once in 3 days to allow it to self clean itself. These practices will ensure your printer wont get any problems.
8. Free installation provided by Canon which you should definitely avail.
9. Refills are way cheaper than cartridges.

Cons:
1. Installation isn't very straightforward so even if you are a genius at figuring things out, I suggest you call the Canon service centre for a free installation setup. They are well versed with it so and its free so dont mess it up by doing it yourself.
2. Print quality is, okaayyyy. Nothing WOW like. Haven't print photos yet so cant talk about that. But regular printing is lighter, as if its trying to save ink. Or maybe my setting is off, cant really say.
3. Scans are really bright, high definition but sometimes light colours come off as white in an image due to bright illumination. Can be rectified via settings in the Scan utility interface.
4. First print is slow. You have to wait for the printer to do its stuff before you print something. After that, the prints are quicker.
5. Pretty noisy when the printer head undergoes adjustment before and after printing. Also during its self clean operation.
6. Vertical paper inlet doesn't allow you to stick it against a wall so you'll need more space at the back.
7. Print alignment occasionally gets angled but its kinda rare.

Verdict :
Although there are a few cons, the pros beat them anyday. If you're looking for a basic home printer or small office/shop printer where you can save money in the long run and still have a decent working product, then go for it. Plus Canons service is pretty fast and efficient so you can always avail their facilities if any problems arise.",4
I was confused between HP / EPSON / Cannon models and based on various research went with Cannon G3000 finally.I had an HP one earlier and never remember using it more than one week without troubles. So HP was out during the initial stage itself. I did not configured the wireless and was happy with USB printing but it looks like it is dhcp enabled and connected to my home wifi automatically. I realized only when I started getting additional printer option on my OS. Used for scanning/ printing / copying many times in the last one moth and it do the job very easily. Normally for any product I go with company where that product is their primary business. Looks like that policy was helpful in this purchase as well. Thanks for reading.,4
"It cost me INR 13K for this printer, but realized it was a waste of money just 1 month into owning it. It's wireless connectivity is a hit or miss most of the time and the printer frequently shows that it's Offline even though the Wifi LED on the printer indicates a good connection. Then we've to reboot it 2-3 times to make it work. Even when it shows Ready, it frequently hangs with the error 'Port is in use', whatever that means! Sometimes even when it's Ready and Connected, it doesn't print and just does nothing as if it's not receiving any signal !! Print quality is also sub-standard for an Ink-Tank printer. It does not even support Automatic Document Feed for 2-sided printing. Nor does it offer any AirPrint support for printing from Apple devices. Total waste of money !!",1
"G3000 is a nice product.

Its an ink-tank printer, that is, Inkjet with a tank to store the printing inks.

Please note it doesn't support duplex printing. Duplex printing is automatic printing of both sides of the paper. G3000 is more of a manual duplex. You will have to pull out the paper after one side printing and then put in back into the printer to have it printed on the other side of the printer.

Print quality is good. Please take 75 GSM papers or above ...If you use lesser GSM papers, it will feel like the printing is not good. Actually a lot depends on the paper type, as far as printing qualities are concerned.
GSM stands for GRAMS PER SQUARE METER. It depicts the thickness and therefore the quality of the paper. Try buying 75 or above GSM papers from local market. The prices in Amazon are kind of at the higher sides.

It support WI-FI connectivity , both over a Wifi router and wifi direct. If you have a router then try using it over the router , otherwise you will have to switch networks a lot between your router network and printer's network.

The installation of the device is a little techie. If you are not comfortable let the support team carry out the installation. The installation is free.

Scanner is pretty good too.

The printer can be calibrated easily from the laptop or mobile application.

Lastly, try to use the printer atleast twice a week. otherwise caking might occur.
Overall its a good printer to use.",5
"I have been using it for about 5 months now and never faced any issue. It is easy to install (installed it myself) and use. Just read the instructions that come with the printer. I bought it mainly to get rid of the printer cable due to limited space at home. So the printer sits in its appointed place and I can take print from anywhere. Prints from mobile using Canon App. I have never faced any wifi connectivity related issue while using it with mobile phone or laptop. The printer is meant for home use and I use for school projects, printing a few photos and other small odd printing/photocopy jobs at home, and the print quality is suitable for the purpose. Don't expect very high quality professional printing. Would have given the printer 4 stars, but I am giving it additional 1 star as I got it for under Rs. 9000 during Amazon promotion sale.",5
"Inks drying problem
If you don’t use regularly, ink will dry in the pipes and print are not with all colours or blank sometimes
I have to deep clean many times through windows maintenance tool.

Overall otherwise no problem.",1
"I purchased this printer on Amazon on 12 Feb 19. As you can see from the picture, I have already landed it for repair at an authorised Canon service centre thrice since then, first time while it was still under warranty and later after expiry of warranty. For the third complaint, which is still appearing as ""Open"", the service centre has conveyed to me that the printer is beyond repair, and since there is no buy back available at my location, the only option I am left with is to throw it away and buy a new one. This is a printer from a reputed brand (Canon) purchased from a reputed platform (Amazon). I am appalled, to say the least. I strongly recommend purchase of electronics and appliances from stores and not from Amazon, and I advise everyone to stay away from Canon products, which become e-hazard sooner than you buy them.",1
"The print quality is good and best i think for the price range,the built quality is also good,however to install wireless it took me some time,also to change the wireless user name and password had to download canon selphy app, the user manual is pathetic, i had to decipher some how to video made on youtube that was in thai language......but once you are done you are set ....thanks to the seller for the two extra black ink bottles.",4
"1 year update
Easy to use
Do not forget to cleanse all the tubes through system cleanser time to time..
It's been almost 14 months I have been using it rigorously..
It works great, though there have been minor problems of page congestions at rare times, but then you have troubleshooters for everything. There're YouTube for help as well, for every other situation.
Refilled the colours once as well...
Trust me there's no better printer+scanner+photocopying gadget at this range; even beyond this range for personal and office use.
One of the best printers I have used!",5
"The printer looks terrific and since I have used the earlier model in my office I can say that the ink tank lasts a long time bringing down the cost of printing. Tech support was great, arrived within 24 hours of call and installed the printer. The wi-fi function is very convenient and its working well (though there is a time lag between print command and printing - but I guess that's to be expected). The first page print takes a little time but there-after its fine. Over-all, very satisfied with the printer till now. I just hope that the ink doesn't dry up or the nozzles don't get clogged due to infrequent use.",5
"Received product from Amazon on time, but the support from canon was a bad experience
Engineer at the first seeing the printer mentioned this is not a good printer and you must have not bought this from Amazon that this and all. later he never was ready to explain anything and just set up everything on his own, when asked to explain the process if something goes wrong / how to connect to mobile... etc., he was never ready to answer and just told any problem you must call customer care and only we can do the setup... he did not even explain how to connect to wifi, mobile. Just did all by his own and left... Totally a bad experience from Canon. I must have gone to HP or another printer...",4
"It says its Mac and iOS compatible but I tried my best it won’t connect to either of the apple devices. I downloaded the Canon PRINT app on iPhone and also all drivers on my MacBook from Canon site.
It’s amazing that Canon doesn’t try it connecting it to Mac before selling it ans labelling it Mac compatible.
I just couldn’t connect wirelessly with iPhone or Macbook Even I when I followed all instructions to book the alert light comes up again and again.

I don’t know how it performs with windows but if you have a Mac system just keep away from it.
Connecting to a Mac is complex and cumbersome and there is a big IF it would connect at all.
Internet is full of frustrated people trying to
Connect this printer to a Mac system.
If you have a Mac system or an iOS device to use with this printer just don’t buy it.",1
"When the box arrived, I doubted the contents inside as it was just a big box taped only along it's length, with a gap on two sides. But upon opening, everything was found neatly sealed and in order. This is a totally value for money printer, as it comes with two extra black ink bottles. Scheduling of installation was easy. I called up Canon toll free number, obtained the contact of the service center, and called them up to schedule the installation. The service engineer arrived the next day and did the needful. The complete process took about half an hour. He asked if I wanted to install through the router, but I opted for simple installation, wherein I could print directly from my smartphone and by wiring the printer to my laptop. Print quality is excellent for both color and black and white. Got this one for a great price of 11690. I had gone to stores and checked out prices elsewhere, but at all other places the price difference was 2k or more. Got the best price on Amazon and went for it. This printer is excellent for home use and small businesses. I have not checked how many copies it gives with single cartridges, but it should easily give thousands of copies easily. Will give it's money's worth with the cartridges provided. The number of printed pages claimed for a single cartridge is for 7% print area. It is advised to take a few prints every month to avoid keeping the printer too idle.",5
"An utter waste of money for a wifi printer.
No matter how many times you troubleshoot it, the wifi printing always gets stuck, whether i try to connect through a router or directly, the printing gets stuck in the muddle and then i have to print all the pages one by one manually.

Print quality is just fine.
The printer wire is too short, so now i""ve to stand up next to this printer with my laptop in one hand to print through usb, and stand like and idiot for an long time ( when the pages are large and it takes more time to print per page than others). If you are going to buy it for wifi convenience, then forget about it.",1

Let me say categorically it is a very nice mid level printer and at 9K (Lightening Deal) quiet a steal.

Please feel free to go ahead if you are a techie and enjoy using photo shop,GIMP or other image editors.

This printer is not for newbies
Also they have given 2 Xtraa blank ink refills with the box,

I am very happy with it's build quality as well and have faced no issue s in printing over WiFi(LAN). Or via my Android Pie phone

In short go for it if you love to print lots of photos or are interested in small office or WFH business.

Good Luck will post some content printed with G3K soon.

Happy Independence Day 2019.",4
"Stuck b/w choosing HP/Epson and Canon, I went with the Canon G3000 - this is just day 1 review. The main reason for leaving out HP was - made in PRC. Epson ( made in Philippines) lost out due to overall build quality which is found was many notches below Canon's ( prints may be slightly better than canon - marginally only). Canon G3000 - MADE IN Vietnam - super easy self install which took about 20 min all in all. Already taken about 100 pages of print and the quality is just above average - not awesome, but that works as I mainly use this for some basic office printing and majorly for children's study materials. There may be some electronic parts in this which may have come from PRC but the main thing for me was a non PRC build and this one had it. I would suggest anyone looking at 150+ prints a month to go for this. Overall rating at 4 as its a very new product for me and may think about bumping it higher based on further usage........",4
"I've been looking for a reasonably priced multifunction colour printer scanner copier. I must have gone through 50-60 choices before settling on the Canon Pixma G3000. I went through a lot of reviews and i'm glad I selected this one. The print quality is fantastic. Not only is the normal black and white print good but the colour printing is absolutely fantastic. I've already printed so many of photos (I used Kodak photo paper to print photos) and they have come out fantastic. Brilliant colour. The scan quality could be a bit better but I'm not complaining as it does its job well. Also, I checked on the ink refill cost and its much more economical as we simply need to pour the ink in from a bottle as opposed to changing the entire cartridge. Another plus point is that you can connect this printer via wifi so you can print from your laptop/tablet/phone directly to the printer sitting clear across the room and not fuss with attaching usb cable. All in all a great printer. If you're looking for a multifunction colour printer please go ahead and buy this without a doubt. Installation is also very easy. You can either install software from the disk provided or go to the URL in the instruction manual and download from there (if your laptop doesn't have a CD drive then this is beneficial). Go for it!",5
"I'll start with compatiblity issue. I have a Mac as well as Windows desktop so its compatible with Mac no issue there.
Installation is not at all difficult, its best if you download the software first from the Cannon site.Follow the instructions given in the Manuel, its very easy to understand.For WiFi signal use the USB cord provided for quick connectivity.You don't need to watch any You tube videos for installation.
Basic function of a good Printer for me is to give quality printing which I found with this printer.I have not used any glossy paper but with ordinary A4 size paper printing quality is very good.Till now no issues,Im pretty satisfied with the product",5
"I have canon, epson, and hp printers.
I have been using all the brands but canon disappointed me very much.

First this printer starts giving issue within a year I have two one for personal one for office use.

As soon as the warranty expires canon customer service guys are the most horrible fraudulent people i have come across.

They will blame the ink is duplicate ( i bought it from amazon with registered dealer ). Or we have to replace this part and that without even looking. I took a cloth and cleaned the head and everything was working fine.
For any small things which can be solved over phone they we will visit and charge you service fees.

I have a hp and epson printers which are working fine since 4 yrs lilttle issue after two years but thats fine",1
"The printer looks good aesthetically. Very good quality plastics used. Connecting to the printer is very easy, thanks to wifi and wifi direct built into it. Print quality is very good an 8/10. Scan quality is good 8/10. The scanner does not support the legal size. I will update the review on the ink usage. I just took about 4 prints and you can already see the ink usage. The Magenta color ink quantity was already 50% less out of the box for which I received compensation from Amazon. Manual duplex print option in the settings.

B/W prints - 8/10
Color Prints - 8.5/10
Scan - 8.5/10

That's all folks!",4
"Canon G3000
Pros: It well built. It prints well. It has lots of ink to store and it is cheap to operate.
Cons:
Setting up the WiFi was a headache. Finally managed it. The biggest drawback is either it is connected to wifi through router or each device independently. You cannot have both options at the same time. The second concern is there is no duplex printing so back to back printing has to be manual. The printer does take some long time to print and is little noisy too. The Canon Selphy app is fine but not very user-friendly in selecting the document and making the print setting changes.
I have not called for the technician for the installation but it did take 2 days to set right my WiFi router connectivity. As I said I used it with direct connection until then, but once wifi router is connected this option is lost.

Overall a recommend buy at this price just for the sake of cheap operating costs for this printer and print quality is definitely good if not the best at this price point.",4
"I have ordered it a few months before, and it's not giving proper printing.. it is in guarantee period so, I want to replace it with a new printer",1
"Its been around 2 week I am using this printer. And I must say the document comes with it help you to install it easily with your own.
Wireless connectivity is very good. Easy to connect with multiple device like I have connected with Phone and Laptop both.
Color Print: Quality was good. In starting for few prints (first 10 print) would use lots of color and it look like it will finish early. But wait if we understand initially it use color to fill the tube that's why took lots of color in first few page. After that it work like charm
If you are using glossy paper then make sure after print put the paper aside atleast for 24 hour, to settle down the colors. Otherwise if you use your figures or anything it spread the color unevenly and damage your print.

Limitation:
1. Auto duplex printing is not available
2. ADF feature not available.

Overall I would say for home usage you can completely buy it. It worth it.",4
"Ordered this item in Amazon sale and got it for 8999/-. The item was delivered on time and installation is done after couple of follow ups.

Printing quality is not up to the mark, the prints are coming in very very faded manner even though you select the bold font.

Photo printing is also not up to the mark and definitely not suggestible for the people who wish take the photo prints

Its really hard to set this up to print via cloud and even after one week also I was not able to set this up. This is really a complicated device to set up for cloud.

Over all this is not a great choice!!!!!",3
"Few points of my experience can make your mind. Been using it since an year and its great in print quality and advanced features. But....

Pros -
1. Great color prints...
2. Low cost printing...
3. You can give print out directly from your mobile at just a touch/click via wifi. Just install Canon print app in your smartphone

Cons -
1. During lockdown , i didn't used it as it was kept in my office which costed me 3400 Rupees for head change. Reason - you'll have to print atleast a page daily without any gap. I contacted service support and they informed me now. Earlier call centre employees told me about printing atleast once in 7 days. So if u have less usage , laser printers will be better.
2. Keeps sounding frequently without any reason many a times like as if you have given a print
3. Slower printing speed compared to laser printers...
4. Customer support is ok but i feel angry they didn't told me earlier when i asked them clearly. Service executive who came to install it was a kind of very rude person. Didn't expected it from Canon like multinational brand.

Believe me Ink tank printers (this one) is far better than cheap inkjet printers but do keep it in mind about Cons above. Choose wisely between Inktank and laserjet printers according to your usage. If u need high quality, low printing cost and advanced wireless printer at very affordable price , order it right now. Its at great discount on amazon and usually is always at great prices during every great indian festival sale.
Easy to install in windows 7 or higher. For XP you will need service pack 3.Mobile app is world class...!",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Worst Printer ever seen.Purchased in june 20 and got the error of no print issues in 3 months,called service center and they came on time , they did some deep cleaning and again started working.Saw that after deep cleaning,my 50 Percent ink reduced due to deep cleaning done by executive.Again found such issues and huge weird sound while print. Now having huge sound in scanning as well. AFTER a few days again facing bad quality printing, executive came but no proper resolution and again done deap cleaning and ink reduced.Also it took only 400 pages print and my 25% black in remain and 50% color print while printed very few 100 while canon claim 6k black and 7k colour pages which is far away..do not buy cannon and go to other make..",1
"Bought it yesterday. First review
Unbelievably complex and volatile machine.
Since the time I have it, I spend more time setting it up than printing anything. The app and connectivity is a joke and a great example of making things unnecessarily complex. Already regret buying cannon
Print quality is ok, but just difficult to get there",1
"It's very easy to install. Though mannuals provided are not that useful, can easily install.

Pros
1. Model is very compact. Requires less space to place it.
2.print quality is excellent
3.scan works perfect.

Cons
1. Mannualy have to reverse the sheet for double side print.
2.with the help of there app , can't print double side.",5
"The initial setup of the printer is such a painful process. Whatever steps were provided in brochure doesn't work and added to that Canon's contact us page doesn't open. My view of Canon has completely changed. I am waiting for seller to get back with my issue and if not, will proceed with a product return and opt for better printer product",1
"Good print quality. Print speed is not great, but acceptable. Build quality is not that good. The LEDs near the buttons wobbles when touched and plastic quality is not that good. Setup was easy to do. You don't really need to wait for canon's installation. I tried with 280 gsm photo paper and images are good even in borderless mode. Printing a full image on an A4 photo paper will take a lot of time. But photo printing speed on 6x4 paper is OK. Black and white copying and printing is quick enough for home or small office use. Apps are OK to use. But you can't do high quality scans from mobile app. You need the PC software to adjust scan quality. That's the only limitation I noticed on the software side. Ink usage is very less. I couldn't see any noticeable drop in ink level even after printing 100 pages. It's a good deal for the money as I bought it during the great Indian festival. Not sure if it's worth the price it's selling for without the discounts. I can't comment on the durability now. But I'll update the review if something goes wrong.

Amazon delivered an already opened box. the original tape was removed and it was repacked. But the inside of the product looks all new and I was able to register it on canon's website and warranty was shown till December 2020. So it appears to be an unused product. It could be a product that is returned by someone after opening the box and not setting it up. It works perfectly and there are no defects. But still I expected better packing. There was absolutely no packing at all and the printer was visible if you lift the side of the lids. The lid wasn't even taped properly. The rating I have given is for the product model, not for amazon or the seller.",4
"Bought in May 2020.
So far the print quality has looked average.
I realised it doesnt have paper storage - its a good feature to have.
Its supports double sided print but manually. So you have to put the paper again to make it peint on the other side. Another good feature to have.
Installation was ok with the help of youtube videos.
Wifi setup was a pain but i got through it.
Nevertheless, i hope it stays good for a few years.",4
"This printer helped immensely during the lock-down days. Lot of school/office project work could be done. It was very easy to install, installed it on my own. Print quality is good at this price. Got it for 12K. People might have got it for less earlier but during the lock-down and no offers, this was what I could get.

While playing, my kid accidentally threw some tiny plastic toy in the input paper tray so it was causing the paper to be jammed and I couldn't get it out. Installed cannon support app on mobile and registered for a technician to visit. He visited immediately the next day and sorted out the issue. This is during the lock-down/restricted days. So very happy with the support.
Only one issue with the printer is the color ink gets consumed relatively quickly. Black ink is very robust, I have printed many pages but still shows a lot of ink is available.
Overall happy with the purchase.",5
"i finally decided to go back to an inkjet after a decade - picked this on a whim as a replacement for an old b/w laser (which in turn was a replacement for an inkjet which terribly expensive cartridges)
Setting this up wasn’t particularly easy

Setup - 3/5: The physical setup of installing the cartridges and network connectivity took a while although I believe Canon does offer a doorstep installation service (which I did not use)
The software installation on a Mac was quite easy for the printer setup although setting up the scanner for wireless scans did take a while

Do note that this does not support airprint natively (although there is an easy workaround if you have any linux machine on your network)

Cost of prints - 5/5: the tank is a beast, i have taken quite a few full color high quality prints but do not see any visibile drop in the levels

Quality of print: 4.5/5 - Text prints and general graphics are great regardless of choice of paper
However I was initially disappointed when i took photo prints on a generic brand glossy paper - the colors had a yellow cast and looked dull and different from what I see on a monitor’

However once my order of a kodak 280gsm glossy paper came in, i realized the issue was with the paper.
With the higher grade photo paper, the color rendition is practically the same as the monitor

all in all, a great buy - i just hope it lasts",5
"Great product with good scans and little short of good for printing.
Please do buy a cover for the printer as it helps protect the printing heads from dust.
Just follow the instructions in the manual and it is a breeze to set it up.

I personally never called the tech support so I wouldn't be able to comment on how good they are.

Setting up the Wi-Fi printing ability with a router might be a task because every time your phone or laptop disconnects from the wifi network the printer also becomes unavailable.

Preferably set it up independently.",4
"got it on June 01, 2020.
but no one from canon has come to install it. Canon care say that they will send someone to install, but they do not know when.
So buy it, only if u know how to install.
Very poor service by Canon.",1
"Good product and value for money overall. I’ve read some reviews that the colour ink doesn’t last the number of pages advertised- and this may be true of you are taking high DPI colour prints (like photos). For daily colour prints I’d advise switching to a lower resolution. I’ve taken about 40-50 colour prints so far and the colour inks have gone down by an average of a quarter tank and the black tank has hardly gone down.

Installation is nowhere as simple as a laser printer but if you follow the instructions pamphlet it shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes. The biggest problem I faced was setting up the wifi network for the printer - had to install an app on my phone and had to fiddle A LOT before I got the wifi functionality to work. Once installed it works like a charm.

I’ve been a laser-only user for the past decade so the monochrome print quality is a bit disappointing (compared to a laser printer) and this printer is noisier than comparable HP models.",4
"Canon Pixma G3000 Review after using printer for 2 weeks to print approximately 50 pages

1) Easy to install by following printed instructions supplied with product.
2) Easy to setup drivers / softwares using CD accompanying product. Drivers / Softwares available on Canon website as well to downtand install.
3) Easy to search wi-fi configuration setup in the manual and follow setup instructions to the word to setup wireless printer access seamlessly.
4) Printer has its own Wi-Fi network for direct mobile to printer connection. Internet access is disabled on this channel.
5) Printer can be setup easily on Google cloud to access from anywhere through any device. This allows to print from mobile without disconnecting your normal wi-fi and while staying connected to internet.
6) Print quality is very good for normal text and images. Very crisp and clear reproduction of text in black and white mode. This is my most basic need so I am happy with this product.
7) Image print quality varies with paper quality used for printing image. Colour image printed on normal 75 gsm A4 size plain paper is satisfactory.
8) 3 black ink cartridges & one cartridge each for C,P&Y supplied with produt.
9) Compact is size and produces much less noise during text printing compared to image printing.

Missing - automatic duplex printing at this price range.

Thank you.",5
Best printer. A little heavy but the print quality is good. 1st time refilling is some diffi2but after that its ok.totally satisfied with this all in one printer.,5
"Printer is not able to dispense the magenta color. Had to call the service center for get it done. Raised a complaint, let's see how do they do. Black and white prints are good. But very challenging to install. Hp is not this way, it is plug and play.",4
"So far I like the printer. It seems to be user serviceable. 1. There is two user installable/replaceable printer head. One for Color and one for Black. 2. The ink tanks are easy to fill. No need to worry about spilling the ink when flipping upside down. Just don't squeeze until the nose is in the hole of the tank.
I bought this printer because I wanted to have one where I could replace the ink myself. I am so tired of paying through the nose for ink cartridges! And this printer has very easy to fill ink tanks, does both black and white and color prints, and has easy to figure out settings. The prints are crisp and clean, no streaks or other problems. I have not printed any photos, only documents, but they are all great.

I think the reason it works so well is possibly because it doesn't have all those other bells and whistles. But whatever the reason is, I am extremely happy with it. I hope it lasts me for many years! And the way it runs, I would guess it will.

I did have a problem with initialization. The tanks are a bit more complicated than cartridges. More problematic, though, is after filling the tanks, you must trigger the initializtion procedure. The manual just says it takes six minutes but never says how to tell if it completes successfully. After connecting to computer it took an hour for me to realize something was wrong and another hour to find their error codes. The canon website is huge with dead ends and loops. I suggest registering and using the MyProducts page to start. This quickly locates manuals, videos, trouble shooting, and an on line tech chat. Once I found this, the problem was quickly resolved with a replacement. I also suggest looking at the support videos that show setup. I give 5 stars because this printer has a well thought out design and works good, canon provided excellent support, and buying ink by the bottle is very satisfying.",5
"We have to call Canon for free installation or any assistance, Amazon might not be providing it. It requires few drivers to be installed, which we can get it from Canon website and set up or installation is also easy as per document or user manual given. Install mobile app like Canon Selphy or inkjet and Canon printer services to use print services from mobile. And always use power on/off button on the printer before switching it off with switch board buttons.",4
"My first canon ink tank. Saranwrap packing looked jaded from travel. Installation even after you tube videos was abhimanyus chakravyuha as the critical 6 min initialization step was glossed over and missed in the visual assault of over illustrated treasure hunt instruction maps. Eventually ink flowed. Printer seemed noisier than claimed 46 db at initialization. With the carriage making a thud noise like getting down a step under a load. Have to watch out if it is always. Wifi printout via app seems to be an issue returning with no communication with the printer. Check network etc. black ink only filled 3/4. Didnt pay much attention as there were two more free bottles. otherwise b/w photo print is good. Colors on photo paper 3+. Wont wake & print from iphone app even when on same wireless, as mg3670. Will update with thud noise.",4
"Installation of the product is difficult. No proper instruction is provided along with the printer. But the instruction on the website and pdf file format is good and useful. Print quality is fine have not tried with photo paper yet. On a normal print paper, the color print out is legible and nice.

One thing that is missing is auto-reverse printing. After charging so much (for the money paid) they could have included reverse printing option. Currently one has to do manually, no auto-reverse printing. Otherwise, go for this printer and worth selecting the same.",4
After sales support. Not compatible to all the routers. Connectivity issue keeps popping. The tech support team of canon will say router has an issue. And when you change the router the same issue keeps coming. Again the team will examine and say router has an issue. Canon tech support team will never admit that product has an issue. So if you are bold enough to deal with the new sense please buy it,1
"This printer was fantastic. But within 1.5 years it just stopped printing one fine morning. Printer head showed problem. Deep cleaned multiple times as instructed in canon troubleshooting site. Contacted Canon for out of warranty paid service. A person came the very next day, had no clue. Opened it up and now it doesn't even turn on. Provided me an estimate of 8K for repair which I declined. This is like a piece of junk and not at all expected from Canon",1
"Product delivered on 17th, have installed on 20th...not even a single printout came out. Every time there is a page loading error. Tried for two days still haven't got a single printout. Called customer care, they registered a complaint on Friday, service executive came and opened every part of the printer to check. It was completly disheartening to see a new device torned out. He examined and have3n found anything. After that he called someone in his office and told the status and then confirmed that there seems to be a sensor issue which needs to be replaced. I mean seriously...not even a single page came put and sensors are gone. I said ok, do as u want. Still awaiting the resolution... bad experience",1

"Canon Pixma 3000,print quality is excellent ,mobile printing by Redmi 4 good quality only thing is that it prints a small photograph size,not very easy to install ,I had asked the installation through Khandwa customer care who came within 24hrs after the request was sent ,despite hot summers in Khargone he came by bus to the village changing two buses and installed the printer,but it needs a better version of Windows to install on desktop but my version is if 2013,Easy to use by push of buttons.Ink supplement in good quantity 2extra bottles of black .Manufactured in Vietnam with MRP of Rs 15455/-but after the full discount was made value for money by Amazon and the final value was Rs 9261/- only. A big thanks to Amazon.in and the installation engineer",5
"Please refer the screen shot, product got delivered with half yellow ink. Other two inks are also below expected level ( some other customer has mentioned the same issue in previous reviews). Although its Amazon fulfilled, I am struggling to get it replaced. If you chose, contact seller it says contact Canon.. when calling Canon they say we don't entertain items sold online... Then contacted Amazon again, they say customer has to send the item back on his own as seller has not provided Amazon pickup for this order. So its a full mess. Regarding print quality, its average.. little dull..WiFi print is quite good ..",3
"I bought this for 14,300 rs approx. I got the delivery within 4 hours .

Talking about the printer
1) It comes with 3 black Ink bottles of 135ml and each of YMC colour bottles of 70ml.
2) The installation is pretty easy.
3) Build quality is sturdy.
4) Print Quality is excellent *note it depends upon the print settings and paper quality. Use good quality paper.
5)WIFI printing works seamlessly , there is also cloud print and other features.

No cons as of such.",5
While installing the printer I noticed that the ink levels for each colour is different while the package size of each bottle is the same.,1
"I am a canon lover. I use canon product but never reach out to the customer care so wasn’t aware that their customer care is 3 rd class. It’s not easy to install at all. I was using HP inkjet for long time as I got a gift from my previous office but I have ordered this one for my father’s business. I am well aware of printer installation and how to use it.

"Great print quality, it’s been a few days since I have started using n I am satisfied with the printer.. just one drawback- wish it had the air print feature. Currently if u want to give a print out using your phon, you need to save the files to cloud space, then go to canon app and give the print command. Wish I could directly give the command from my photo gallery..",5
"A nice decent product, useful and easy to use.
It did take some help to set up WiFi but once done it's super easy to operate the printer.
Print quality is good, haven't yet tried on photo paper but color documents have good prints. One can scan and copy too from the mobile app and directly save the scanned documents on mobile, which I feel is an added advantage. Print speed isn't that slow either, I would certainly recommend this product. Only thing I am not sure is whether the printer will deliver 7000 colour pages with the ink that is given with it .....time will tell. But in all a good purchase....even for parents who need prints for school projects.....",4
I bought this from Amazon and within one I faced issues three times . After warranty period again it’s got damage when I visited service centre they inform board got damage and need 3000 for changing. Once they change the board then only they can find out another problems. By frank they cannot recctify this and we form me if you need you can return the same . Hardly I take 500 prints only..always go for Epson,1

INITIAL REVIEW:
Installation is not very easy..but anyone can..just follow the procedure properly.. Google can help also..
Print quality is good... Both color & bw...
Even I printed my Passport & stamp size photos in glossy photopaper and it is very good...
Ink is Ok.. Ink Usage is also seems ok.. Can tell more after using months...
Scan quality is also good.. But one thing.. You cant preview before scan.. Only can see after..
Overall good printer for home and small office use... As per my initial review...",5
Product is very good. Came with proper packaging. Works very well. Print quality is good. Connecting first time to Android and iPhone takes time . But after connection is completed works flawlessly. Prints wirelessly without requirement of router. Direct printing is good via op5.,4
"I've used the printer for almost a month now.
Quality is good, print colors and scañ is good too.
Only issue is the info that came with the printer, yellow ink bottle was half empty..
Also, per page color printing cost the 50 times higher than what's mentioned",4
Apple users. DONT BUY THIS PROUCT. AIRPRINT DOESNT WORK. BADLY STUCK,1
"Update: broke down within 10 months of light use. Cannot recommend it anymore.

For the price, this is a fantastic printer.

+ You get decent photo quality, good enough for home use and craft work.
+ Document printing is also excellent and well suited for school activities.
+ The ink refills are reasonably priced. The printer comes with a full set and an extra black ink refill.
+ Manual duplex works well, which is a great help in saving paper.
+ Draft mode prints documents rapidly and they are very readable even with the lighter printing.
- The scanning quality could have been better. Photo scans lack finer details though document scans are fine. It doesn’t pick up colour gradations as well as we would have liked.

Really happy with the purchase even though scanning quality could be better. Knocked off a star for scan quality.",1
"Major issues and a horrible product
1. Print quality is not great.
2. Colour print quality is absolutely horrible.
3. Colour head has issues and printing with gridlines from day 1. On glossy paper it is visibly very clearly.
4. Plug is also loose that connects to the printer.
5. It is very very slow in printing.

They are not cancelling orders. Return also they are asking so many questions.

Reviews all seem to be paid reviews. Please DO NOT BUY this product.

I had HP printer basic one, the print quality was much better in that.",1
"This cannon pixma G3000 printer is just WOW ,consumes ink very wisely ,I recently print more than 300 colour documents with a plain paper setting and it's just charm ink is almost almost at same level though ink level decreases around 3mm suddenly when initially charges dry print heads but afterwards it's WOW machine ,print quality is super crisp whether it's colour or B/W ........ i connect it with my android phone and i am shocked it connects in a blink of a second, Go for it friends you won't regret I bet 🌹",5
"1. Used it for about 5 days now
2. Installation little tricky but manageable
3. Sturdy
4. Photo print on regular paper is no good
5. Photo print on kodak 280 gsm ultra premium is simply brilliant, just superb. However, must use hi quality images for printing and not low pixel mobile phone pics
6. Scan n copy functuons are fast n easy with a single click
7. Wifi connectivity is super once setup. No need for any modem or router
8. Mobile app is ok.

9...Now after a few more days, i find that even the pics printed on odinary paper seem to have improved.",5
"Afte using a month found few thin

1 Printing speed is very poor.

2. If.are printing on a sticky sheet then there is lot of trouble , like ink issue paper jam etc.

3 Phone printing is too slow.

4 . So over all not a good printer as expected.",3
"Very disappointed in the beginning when I received a used printer by this dealer.

But thanks to Amazon for quick replacement after raising a complaint
After limited use, my score out of 5 would be,
Built Quality: 4.5
Installation and setup: 5
App interface: 4.5
Print quality: 4.5
Scan quality:4.5
Printer noise level: 4
Wireless and USB connectivity: 5
Over all rating: 4.5

This is the best printer for Home use, Kids Project and small businesses.
I purchased this printer mainly for, 1. kids homework
2. Scan and print office documents, photographs, sketches and paintings in multiple sizes up to A4

I will more feedback after using few months",4
The best printer in the range.. Brilliant quality and the ink black or color seems to lats a lifetime.. Great app as well for the PC with very helpful types.. I set it up myself without an engineer and it works like a charm... One of the best buys I have made ever.. Just but this one with closed eyes... It's an MFP as well... Low on cost in terms of ongoing maintenence and refills... This will save loads of money in the longer run..,5
"We been using this for 2 weeks almost. Connectivity is a very big problem. The wifi is never smooth. Every time it needs to be kind of reset. Very disappointed as this looks to be not so well tested product. I think I made mistake to choose this.
Update: revising rating from 3 star to 5 star. The real issue in connectivity was faulty router which caused printer to not work with Wifi. When I changed my old router with new device printer started working as expected. So as of now I don't see any issue and happy with the product so far. The ink seems consumed more but will revise the review in case ink is the issue. Will update further in the interest of potential buyers.",5
"I took a day to install the printer. The Ink went to half its range. Installation and connecting to wifi was too hectic. I was about the return the printer back.

Once It started working, I was amazed. I took photo printing in photo sheet. The quality was very good in a photo sheet. If you want to take a photo print try with photo sheet else you will loose lot of colour ink in a ordinary paper.

Photo printing, colour printing, xerox, scan all of those I do over the wifi using my phone.

Overall awesome experience with a first time wifi printer.",5
"Good printer and very ink efficient. The down side is that it’s not an air printer and doesn’t work with Apple phones. I would have expected this feature as a basic at this price point. My earlier printer was HP and was low cost but it had the feature. Similarly, the PRINT app that supports this printer also has a poor UI. I wish Cannon did something to improve the app.",4
"Following the instructions in the manual the Set up worked flawlessly with WiFi and prints and scans in Linux as well without any hassle once set up in CUPS. Initially I had to set up the printer networking configuration using the Canon app in iPad and once the printer is set up on the network, CUPS automatically detects it as a network printer if connected on the same WiFi network. In iPad disappointed that it does not have AirPrint support but printing works with the canon selphy app. The print quality is decent enough though I feel the black is not dark enough. Print speed is decent enough. I have yet to check the scan quality though scanning seems reasonably fast.

Will update this review after long term usage to report on issues faced if any.",5
"If you are thinking of a wireless printer this is the one to go to.... the printer is very compact and had a very even shape design which makes it fit well on any tables or stools that you would like to place it on.. did a self installation and it is super easy... there are very good video guides provided by canon and I recommend using them while installing...
Please be vigilant about which model you are buying as not all models support Mac... this information information is not very clearly visible as well..",5
"Difficult to install, definitely wait for engineer for the installation. Connecting with wifi not a easy task, troubleshooting comes often, printing waiting time is too much, I witnessed very strange thing and I believe nobody talked about in Amazon comments section, canon app doesn't support word or Excel file to get a print though your mobile phone (android/iOS) but yes same can be printed from the laptop. Customer care service is pathetic they even don't know which application to be downloaded for print they are useless and not able to give a solution at all totally waste of time. I think made a mistake and purchased canon ink toner, I think HP printers will be a better call, I have experienced HP printers in the past with better features, seemless wifi, customer experience is good. Not Happy with my decision. Its your hardmoney take a cautious call while purchasing.",2
"Amazing printer for Mac book owners.
It’s very easy to use and at the same time very economical too. The colour prints are of superb quality. Having this home is a blessing as a lot of time is saved in transferring your data to other devices. Eventually you save time and money both. Best product. Loved it totally ❤️",5
Really amazing printer. Fast and reliable printing. Good quality scanning. You can even select different dpi for scanning. Installing is very easy just follow the steps and you are done. Deserves five star for performance but giving 4 because there is problem in loading paper as you have to make sure that the paper is on top of paper inlet slot. Overall a very good printer.,4
"This is Canon's basic ink tank printer. Very basic but enough for home and small office needs. Was delivered in one day from Amazon. Called Canon and the executive arrived within 4 hours. Opened the box and set up the printer all very professional. Only issue was he did not know how to install for Mac OS. Was struggling a bit but then with my help it got installed. No problem in printing so far, scan all very cool with WiFi. Go for it.",5
"Colour Prints are little faint,first ink set is free,wifi works with app,password is on the lable near cable connection,working fine if , cloged or stops printing,do the suggested pc process of automatically cleaning head and then test print,ink tank will save money,and don't buy the chip printers they have a lot of drying cartridge issues and also costly cartridges it's good for normal home use.",4
The quality of printing is decent enough. The printing speed is quite slow but manageable. Photos can also be printed. Print Quality of the photos are good enough. Installation to connect to WiFi is a bit complicated. Rest it's decent printer to have. Would recommend this printer.,5
"First of all, kudos to Amazon for on-time delivery of product. Placed the order on Saturday and received it the very next day despite it being a regular delivery order. I was a bit hesitant at first while placing the order given the ordeal a few of the buyers had faced here. The seller was Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. But, thankfully, everything was in place when I received the package; all the seals were in place. All the bottles were packed. I got the GST invoice too. So, overall a nice purchase experience.
Coming to the product, I was in 2 minds whether to go for G3000 or G3012. But since GST credit wasn't available, I had to go for this one. I wonder why they can't give a GST invoice on the other one. Setting up the printer was a breeze. Just make sure that you go through the installation manuals first. A little more of text and not just images in the manuals would have been much more helpful. There's a short animated video regarding the installation procedure by Canon on Youtube as well. That was really helpful. After going through the manual and the video, the setup took barely 15 minutes. I see a few reviews telling that the printer consumed a little ink even before taking a single printout. Well, that's so because at the time of setup, the printer sucks a bit of ink to fill the pipes going to the print head. The per print ink consumption is going to be really low post the installation.
I tried my hand at interfacing the printer through direct wi-fi to my Android smartphone first. It got connected without any fuss. Haven't tried connecting it through router yet. After having both the devices paired, I got a nice colored document printed first. It took around 8-10 seconds and print quality was great. Next I printed a document in grey-scale. The output was great and it took under 5 seconds to have the document printed. Next, I scanned a document to my smartphone and it disappoint me this time either. Will post an update once I try it with glossy photo paper.
So all in all, it was a great buying experience and I am completely happy with the purchase.",5
"Ordered Pixma G3000 by going through all reviews available in Amazon. Reached quickly.
Unpacked and installed without any help from Technical team. User manual on installation was really helpful.
Did the first print, and wow!!, that was great.
One small suggestion is the app for Canon pixma didn't install perfect in my Mac Big Sur.
Scanning can be done only via Mobile. But so far so good.",5
"City Bangalore
using almost 15months I have noticed
1.if you are regularl user use evey week or or gap of 4 to 5days or paper will jam but very easy technique to remove the paper jam urself check with the technician who visits you
2.keep away from dust and cockroaches
3.tech support is very good they will visit you withn 24hrs any problems they will rectify very good.
4 I have used 1500pages and ink level has just gone may be 15 to 10 % very good wifi works great
5 colour printing very good clearity
After switching on don't give print immidiatley wait for printer to respond it will take about 1min to settle down u will hear the noices after noices are stop then give print
10. this my user review I might be wrong this what I have found using this printer",5
"Too early to tell but my initial experience has been good so far. Will post more after few months.
I am casual home user and Its my first printer. Since i preferref thermal head so i narrowed down to canon and hp , went with canon due to paper size support and of course extra black ink :) . I am a geek so installing this printer was super easy ( step by step documentation would have been helpful for many, will post a youtube video). I also connected it using wired, direct wireless and with my router (using this last option now and i can print from any device connected with my router. To connct press wiressless button for 5 seconds then B + wiress button, now its trady to pair with router, so press pair/wps button on router and done!! Use canon print service with default apps/function on mobile/pc ). Everything super easy. I preferred using other print apps so didnt use selphy app. Even used google cloud print ( this would any be out of business by 31st december) , one drive and ij cloud print and . Works perfectly. If you are not a geek and a simple home user I would recommend to always buy this. In general go for AIO (All in one) wireless inktank printer which supports upto 270 gsm paper. I am not a photo enthusiast so cant tell much about photo quality, seemed good enough to me. Tried 270 GSM paper, no issues ( its major plus points over HP 410). If you are ready to spend 12-13K rs buy it without much thinking. A LCD display would have been definately helpful for troubleshooting but not a show stopper ( you can always check error codes in web server as well).

Avg customer care, Ink and print head seems cheaper than other companies.

Printer in this class are costly (this one is cheapest in the class when compared to other companies like epson, brother and same as HP 410). Given that these printers are simply a 4K - 5K wired inkjet AIO printers with inbuilt CISS kit and a low class print server, should not have been more than 8000-10000 rs.",4
"Fine wireless printer to print from phone and laptop. Does colour, black and white printing scanning well also print quality is good. Note manual leaflet needs to be read properly for proper setup and use. Comes with 3 of black and 1 each of colour ink, usb/power cable too is included.",5
"1 . Excellent printer which let's you print enjoying the comfort of your cot .. the wifi connectivity feature is a true bliss .
2. The B&W as well as the colour print quality is superb.
3. Easy to install all info available on YouTube and User Manual .
4. My recommendation .. plz go for a wifi printer it is surely worth the extra buck.",5
It's good printer. Have been using it for a month now for occasional printing. Print quality is good. Haven't tried photo printing yet. But normal colour printing is good. Only downside was the initial installation which was quite confusing for a first time guy. But once set up it works smoothly. WiFi printing via mobile app is very very handy. I recommend this printer for home usage.,5
"Dont buy..... Because it is works very slowly. And if u need more copy for scanned document, every time u must scan untill required no of copy obtain.... The wifi setup also difficult to connect to smartphone..not user friendly.. So i think this printer was complete waste of money...",1
"THIS IS BEST AND SUCCESSFUL PRINTER OF CANON WITH WIFI FACILITY. EASY TO FILL INK TANK AND USE. I USE FOR ALSO PVC CARD PRINTING AND PHOTO PRINTING. RESULT IS SUPER AND NO ONE PRINTER AS THIS IN THIS TIME. I STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, IF YOU WANT TO A BEST ALL IN ONE PRINTER AND ALSO LOW COST PRINTING, THEN MUST BUY CANON G3000.",5
"Good print quality and a better option than a printer with a cartridge that needs to keep being replaced.
The wireless connectivity is great and easy to set up and you'll love it once you install the canon apps on your phone.
Makes printing from a phone a breeze.
Recommend to get the cover for the printer as well since you shouldn't get dust in the scanner.
Good product and great value for money.",5
"I have been using this printer for last 1 month and it's working great. Due to COVID-19 I did not get proper installation, I installed myself it's easy and also I got some help from the person who was supposed to install over the phone. But after installation it's very easy to use. And the wifi feature is very useful as I have no computer but I am able to give all my prints from my Android phone without connecting any cable very easily. This printer is also very ink efficient so saves money if you have use it regularly.

Go for it.",5
"Super quality prints , canon print app is very useful to get prints over wifi. With all option. Scan copy n print with in it.

The CD ROM provided with dedicated editing software for making calendar collage greetings templates. It is a value for money printer.
3 Ink bottle of CMY n 3 bottle of black received in box. So it's 6000×3 black n white prints And 7000 color with provided stuff .",5
"Very worst product and customer care, call was transferred to 3 executive it took nearly 15 mins, finally the last person seems to be head of customer care without listening to my query he cuts the call, the worst customer care ever by Amazon, let's come to the product now product was used somewhere else and it was repacked to me, after installation not even a single page was printed so far absolutely worst product....only waste of time and money.",1
"Excellent printer, it took little time to install specially the wifi printing. After installation it is working smoothly. I am using it for printing documents and photos from iphone and from windows laptop and MacBook too.
Go for it one of the best available printer in India!👍🏻",5
After using for 3 months I can say Printer is a pain when you actually need it. We have to keep resetting its wifi it disappears from its app by itself. After doing all the circus and getting it to work it will print few pages and suddenly stops pro ting and throwing messages like the printer is busy. I will not recommend this printer to anyone,2
"Using it from atleast month and half,
Print Quality:- Good as expected from canon, printing speed is nice on plain A4 size paper at standard quality setting.
Economy:- Got three bottel of Black ink 100 ml each along with 3 colour bottles 70 ml each, though company claim 7000 black and 8000 color prints per set of ink but it not to be seems to possible. As per my experience it will print almost 2000 pages per sets at standard setting but if u r planning to print photos on photo paper at higher quality then colour tank got suck very fast althougt it still very very economical than cartage printer.
Installation:- Very simple and straight forward just go through some youtube videos, dont relay on user manual iys just good for nothing.
Conclusion:- Printer is overall good, look nice. As a inkjet inktank printer you have to take some precautions like Protect it from Dust is must and keep printing in every 2 to 3 days.
And please go for wifi version it is lot more convenient like you can place it anywhere u want and print from almost anything that has wifi.
धन्यवाद",4
Product came box came in damaged condition. But the printer works very well,4
I like the printer as it does all that I need..pics are nice you might need to use a better photo app software for better picture in glossy paper. But overall 5 star rating .I installed printer and it took 15 mins including cartridge alignment and charging .,5
"Ordered this product, Amazon delivered earlier than slated, with all precautions, given the pandemic situation. Quarantined the box and was skeptical how I would do the installation without the support of a company representative.
Cut open the box and was amazed at the neat and clean packing. Installation was a breeze. Decided to use patience as the key and reserved two hours on Sunday evening to install in 'no hurry mode'. Followed the instructions as given the 2 booklets (1 for hardware installation and 2 for software/driver installation). Just adhered strictly to the instructions substantiated clearly with schematics. Took 30-45 minutes to patiently install and was ready. Lift and ensure you lift the printer lid to the assembly is firmly locked before you undertake the hardware installations. Finding the power outlet was a visual challenge and gave myself a good laugh after I saw the instructions where the power outlet was located.
Gently peel off the stickers where applicable and also placing the cartridges gently is the key. Gently emptying the ink into the well marked ink tanks. Take extra care in being gentle to open/close the caps to ink tanks and the lids. And firmly close the lid completing the hardware installation.
Now for the software installation - surprised to find a CD-ROM, but went straight to the Canon website and downloaded the drivers. On Win10 and also on the iPhone, setup was a breeze. .On Win7, I have a small challenge (may be related to the Win7 upgrade). Getting to print a test page was quite easy. I used the JK Copier 70GSM paper and it worked pretty well.
The entire printer and its assembly looks great from design and manufacturing - the Japanese way is very evident.
The only option that I still need to figure out is a way to see if there is a 'Draft' mode further use the inks in an eco-friendly mode.

Overall, very happy and proud to have purchased this....and the price of ink refills will be more economical.",5
I am using it since last 2 months. Works perfect. Not sure if the ink would last for 6000+ pages as advertised. I see already 1/4th ink used for few 100 pages. Photo print quality on glossy paper is not that great. Also no calls from Canon customer support for installation. Self installation is not easy with the given printed instruction. I did it watching some YouTube videos but it took 2-3 hours for complete setup.,4
"Good Printer at this price. Useful for home usage.
3 Black ink bottles and 1 set(3 bottle) of colour ink bottles is more than sufficient for home use.
Photo print is not of great quality but we should remember that at this price we cannot expect too much.
Very much satisfied for buying this printer.
Wifi connectivity is too quick to print. Go for it and for sure best value deal.",5
"I ordered it for my regular use for taking colored and b/w A4 prints for my sewing purpose. The wifi works really amazing.

Installation is easy.
The color tanks are easy to fill. Connection with wifi us super easy. Go to product website and a complete guide is given to install step by step.

Ink Tank:
3 colored and 1 b/w tanks are given empty. Ink bottles come along with the printer which is easy to fill into the empty tanks.

Print Quality:
I have take b/w and colored and it's nice.

Best for home use.",5
"Product delivery happened as per scheduled.
But the product received was a defective one, printer not working. So booked technical appointment and the technical visited and inspected as per schedule. Technical recommended to return the item. Totally dissatisfied with defective product delivery.
After returning the product, it took 10 days for refunding and also 2 times forced to call customer care
Dissatisfied with refund process",1
Pathetic service. I would rather say there is no customer support. They have a whatsapp bot which only ask you issue without any solution.. I would never recommended cannon product to anyone. Giving 1 rating as that's the only option but they deserve 0..,1
"Very nice printer... Printer quality is awesome and you can print your own photos - no need to go to print studios. The engineering of the printer is ultimate.

it takes a little while to install and configure the wireless, though. Yes the tank ink reduces quite some the first time because of the ink flow into the pipes, but you shouldn't get worried.

It's only been few weeks... Need to check the cost of print, etc.",5
"Paid 12K for a Canon printer, it failed within 13 months of purchase! Service agent came, first he said it is problem with the printer heads, asked 3000/- to replace both b&w and color heads. He replaced and the printer still didn't work. Then he says a chip needs to be replaced, it would cost 5000/-!!!! Better I would buy a new printer. Had an HP printer before and worked for over 8 years without problem. Wasted 12000/- on this junk printer that I have to throw away.",1
"This product is good for only basic usage. The print quality is not at all good. Color print is too bad. Keeping in mind the inkjet functionalities, I guess this will be same for maximum of the inkjet printer. Printing speed is not so fast.

Wifi functionality makes it easy to print from anywhere. Even cloud printing is possible.
Overall good for basic use. For office not recommended.",3
"Its build quality lives up to its price. It's quite fast in both printing and scanning however if done by PC not by phone ( scanning is a bit slow if done with a phone ) . It is wireless so you can print anything with your phone or iPad. It also so have extra neat features which is like a cherry on top.
Recommendation: Buy a cover for it in order to protect it from dust or debris . Trust me it's super important .",5
"Came with Black and color inks, which is very good. Setup takes a while and can be a bit difficult first time. Have been using on wifi mode, it'sa bit slow in this mode though in middle of the signal coverage, so you might experience pause between printing. Print quality is good is not excellent. For the price it's a good one for daily rough use, and it's quite noisy, but compact and great looks.",3
"The print quality is good. But there are some other issues with the printer -
- Setting it up is difficult
- does not support auto duplex printing or manual duplex in Mac.
- Makes lots of noise.
- No Airprint support
- No LCD dispaly

Fortunately Amazon accepted a return on this one , so returned it and went for the new 3020 with much better features.",3
"This printer is excellent for home use in terms of its cost.Printing through wifi ease the effort of transferring the data from mobile to Computer.

While connecting with wifi through android based mobile, the password is Device sl.no. which is printed at the back. One should know, since after a lot of permutations & combinations I was came to know the wifi password.

It is not mentioned anywhere. It's somewhat tricky.

Installation of cartridges in slot is also tricky.

Rest all is excellent in term s of Value for Money.",5
It was a excellent and print delivery by Amazon and but the printer was delivered on Sunday 6th October and as per Amazon free installation is given by canon and we have contacted canon to make a time for installing on 7th October and till now no person from the service team has called or came to install the printer. Poor service from canon side is informed here for your reference.. request you to please contact the canon to help the customer needs,1
"Printer works fine and colour lasts very longer than ink-jet printers. As per purchase terms, it is mentioned as free installation service shall be provided at site/home, but they will provide only telephonic guidelines. Better to search you-tube for installation procedure rather than to depend on company service.",4
"Still can't figure out how to connect it to wireless router, print quality is awesome. Well if you are tech savvy you can easily install by reading the instructions. Some things are not easy to find like how to start WiFi direct and all. I have tested it with plain paper and glossy paper. Plain paper might feel slightly wet if you are using photocopier page. Glossy paper gives quite bright Colors. It also scan well high quality output with scanning. Though it is bit hard to handle different functions though value for money! Got 2 extra bottles of black ink. Thanks to Amazon and seller for worthy deal.",4
"This model is exceptional value for money. Great delivery service from Amazon. They have also included 2 extra bottles of black ink in addition to the bottles provided for the first topup. Setup is easy - there are videos online which guide you through the setup. Wi-fi setup is easy to do on the laptop and on the mobile (using the app). Only gripe is that the scanning software doesnt come bundled and it is quite expensive if you go for Canon's readIris software. Overall, a good buy as this printer is feature-packed and pricing is pretty good compared to the competitors.",5
"After using HP printers for almost two decades I decided to give a try to Canon and now repenting on my decision.
1. The hardware installation is too lengthy and cumbersome.
2. It took ages to to install software and getting the machine activated. The platform will ask you to install all sorts of apps and open too many windows. 3. I bought this machine because of wifi conntivity, unfortunately the wifi is still not working. 4. The worst part is customer care, no one have responded back abd would ask you to rectify your issue by flowing some links.
I have all the reasons to go back to HP.",1
"I am writing this review after using it for a few months. Prior to this, I was using an inkjet printer which was a pain in the neck considering its overall cost of printing.

On the contrary, this product is extremely cost-effective and out performs any other printer in this segment.

I strongly recommend this product.",5
"The worst printer i have ever used,
Print quality is very bad
Paper feeder issue
Plz don’t buy this printer, better to go for HP",1
"Firstly, the delivery was given on the next day of the order. It just great to get it delivered so fast.
Secondly, the printer is awesome and simple to use.
The initial setup will take up some time but once done it quick.
The wireless connection is nice, takes time to understand for setting up, but once done you can print directly from any of your devices like Laptops, Android mobiles or iOS mobiles. Its simple.
Setting up of wireless connection instructions are not provided in the manual and you would need help of Google there.",5
Needs some time before you connect to your devices like ipad.. Read carefully manual and some online demos before starting and after that you can have infinite copies of photos if you have photo paper and colour printouts. Earlier I had catridge printer but tht used to give me trouble to fill ink and replace the catrifges often. Just used it for a month till now and liked the wireless connectivity as I can take printouts og photos also from my ipad without connecting wires.,5
"Easy to install. Just follow the instruction manual. There are two manuals. One for setting up print heads, add ink in tank and then deleting up power. Another manual is for how to setup and configure with PC. The only difficult and tricky part is to set wireless mode with modem or without modem.

Print quality is excellent.",5
"The wifi printer is good,the trial prints both color and black & white were good.
Installation with CD drive faster, but wifi mode installation will depend on internet connectivity & its speed.
Tech support was really good. Technician Suvel Aga was on time and really good, he patiently carried out installation,explained all are queries, demonstrated how to print,scan etc..happy with tech support",4
"Excellent colour printer. Photo prints on glossy paper is of high quality. Once wifi network is setup initially, printer works follessly forever. Scanning & printing can be done through laptop and mobile ( through app).
For basic printing and scanning install cannon print app on mobile. For advanced printing, just install Easy photo print client on pc or app on mobile and play with different types of photo template like board or borderless printing, passport photo printing etc.",5
I had problem with my Printer after a year randomly switches to maintenance mode can't use the printer for printing at that moment so scheduled for HP on site support team to check the issue. two guys arrived and printed some test pages told me all is good with the printer and they don't see and issue. If problem persist they will have to replace the mother board and that will cost me more than actual price I purchased the printer. Interestingly I was charged Rs750/- so just press button on the printer and it was just for 5mins.,2
"Good printer for its value, after a month of somewhat heavy usage I'm very satisfied. Though sometimes the colour printouts aren't sharp, but other than standard A4 paper I haven't tried it on anything else so the results might vary. The black text printouts are all very sharp. Copies and scans are excellent. I'm using it with my Mac running Catalina, and did not encounter any problems, except for WiFi printing which seems to loose connection frequently, again I haven't tried this with Windows, so I'm not sure.",5
Overall it is a good printer. Claimed print count is good. It has to be seen what will be the reality. Print speed is good once the printer is up and running. Scan and print speed could be better. Scan tools provided with the printer is not that great. Copy function is good but takes time and does not have option to take multiple copies. Wifi strength is not that great. Initial setup was a bit painful,4
"Printer arrived on time with good packaging.

I was comparing it with HP 410 and HP 419 but finally decided to go for Canon as this is not made in China :-).

Printer installation is easy. In case you need to configure printer with wireless router, download the software on PC/Laptop and configure the printer via USB cable, that's lot easier than WPS way.

Once configured, printer hardly takes one minute to power up and ready for the printing. Also printing from laptop/mobile over home wifi is quick, didn't face any issue in lase two days since installation. Printed around 25-30 pages and printer seems quite good. Hope it last long.",5
Amazing product. I felt it bit over configured for home use before COVID. However during COVID time it has helped me and my family a lot. It is really useful. Ink last for long time. Easy refill and not expensive as inkjet printers. Worth buying it if you have school or college going children.,5
"I precisely followed the installation video provided on Amazon but the printer failed to load ink. Finally after support from local cannon representative on phone followed by a visit the following day it started working. Some important information which was provided by local cannon support need to be added to the video to make it more helpful.
The print quality is good and WiFi feature is excellent.",4
"Really very much good experience.. print quality super as expected...

4stars coz of print speed.. but High quality makes speed slow..
Black and white print is fast but it scan each time if we give same page multiple orders...
Earlier i used hp ink tank but that design is good for rats.

Thanx to canon that it has 70% less space for them.. just need to put something in output tray to get rid of rats...

Will prefer more to a printer which will have less space for rats...",4
"As soon as my daughter's online class was started, I was looking for a inktank printer for printing her class notes. I am already having an Epson inkjet printer, but Ink cartridges compatible to this printer are not available in market now. Cartridges were also too costly and they get dried quickly. So, after searching a lot for a good inktank printer I have purchased this one and am happy with my decision. Print quality is good and build quality is too.",5
"When you have kids who like to get prints for projects, worksheets, activity, this printer offers a cost effective solution. Refilling is easy. Canon provided 2 extra black in bottles. WiFi feature was a must for me as I wanted to print from multiple laptops & desktop.",5
"Mother board of new printer did not work..got it replaced from canon
Print quality not so good
Speed is very slow
Does not match to quality standards",3
"This is a good printer. It serve the purpose of small businessmen.
1. I am annoyed that it make too much noise before printing.
2. In the description is written that it will print upto 30 pages in a minute but it is not correct information provided by apprio amazon. It can print maximum 10 pages in 1 minute
3. It take too much time auto taking commond before printing.
4. Ink price is little high, try to reduce like Epson.....
Otherwise it is good printer available on no cost emi",3
Took the printer and used it for over a month. Wifi and Wifi-Direct are both working great. No lag or loss of signal. Print quality is great. Setting up and installation is super easy (we can follow the video on canon website for step by step setup). Download the software (part of setup steps) and install - drivers and software will get downloaded with 1-click. Mobile app is also very good and we can connect to the printer through wifi and get the print. I am very happy with the printer and the quality.,5
"Reviewing purchased Cannon G3000

Print out quality of color prints is super pathetic

Color photo prints are very dull

Start up sucks up so much colour inks of all three colours that the tank is almost half empty, even before you take your first color print !

Over all, a complete NO to go ahead for this one ...",2
I expected a small printer but it is some what bigger than they illustrate and the printer gives best quality printing than the laser printer and it is easy to setup initially I don't know anything about the product installation but they give a nice explanation how to do installation that's a added advantage. It looks pretty good and there are many other good also but it's enough here.,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Very bad product by canon. All paper are going to wrong side and damage. Print quality is very bad. Not accuracy in printing. I am disappointed. Very bad experience with this printer. Please do not by this printer. I have called many time to service center but not anyone response.",1
"Scanning quality of photos were lesser than expected and only 3 to 4 color prints can be taken which is also a disappointment. No display, but that didn't seem like a problem when I can do whatever I want in my PC. Working fine when connecting phone and laptop through my router and WiFi direct. If u r a Mac user searching for a small office/home printer around 13k, this is ur best bet.",4
"This is a well made and easy to use product. The print quality is excellent and it prints each page pretty fast. The installation is a little more complicated than the inkjet type printer, so it is essential that you follow the manual when installing or use the YouTube videos.",5
This product delivery was good but i am seing the color is not prominent and it disconnects very often . A doc of 45 page took me around 2 hrs as it was disconnecting repeatedly and if paper is exhausted the printer is starting from page 1 it is not giving option to resume the print. Canon service is monopolistic and is not timely one. Within 6 months of purchase 3 times techinician has visited us already so can think of the quality of the product as well.,4
"The printer is very usefull for home purpose. Print quality is very good. It has scan, photocopy option and print. It has wifi option which works very well. First instalation was difficult for me bcoz i had no idea but we can take help from the company itself.The built quality is sturdy.I am very satisfied with the purchase. Ink is a bit costly.",5
"After one month usage,my review..
First read instructions carefully and watch YouTube videos and do installation.. Or simply call canon helpline for installation during working hrs.. If u do mistakes in that it may damage your printer very badly.. download canon selphy app in phone. Keep wifi router and printer in close vicinity for better speed. Once everything is set its a wonderful printer. Daily 30mins switch on the printer for head movements.. Print one black and one colour every three days for making your printer in good condition..",4
"yes, super easy to install ... just that follow the installation brochure to every word and it will install it seamlessly for you. Thereafter, just plug and play for all your devices. After I installed my printer, i could conveniently install the printer for my mobile and laptops.",5
"Print quality, both color as well as b&w is very good. Printer speed for b&w is pretty fast though it is but slow for color print. It should be more than sufficient for home usage. WiFi connection is additional advantage. Printer design also looks good unlike Epson printer.",5
"Printer is good. Easy to set up without tech support. We haven't had to call tech support sice we bought it. Happy with print quality. Was very useful during Covid times. We have printed multiple color copies ans photos but the ink level is still high. Definitely worth to have for home and small business purposes.
One small is that wifi has to be reenabled multiple times. It doesn't connect fast enough and stay connected.",4
Print quality is pretty ordinary and not of high resolution. Installation can be done by buyer without need of customer support by following the printed installation manual which comes with the package. WiFi is kind of ok. Need to deactivate data service on mobile if printing directly from mobile without any router. .. one good part is that it can continuously print for 10-12 hours a day without much trouble. Onsite support during warranty is available and generally available within 24 hours.,3
"Very easy to install. WIFI capability is a great advantage. We can also print directly from a mobile. I have tried printing on plain paper, photo paper and sticker papers - print quality is excellent. How many prints I will get s yet to be seen. Bottom line great ink tank printer.",5
"If you stop using it for couple of weeks you don't get all the colour printed. Canon utility app never able to fix this issue itself. So, if you're someone who don't print very often or in every two/three days, I'd recommend not to buy Ink tank printer from Canon. I also have difficulties in selecting grayscale or colour while printing from mac.",1
"Worth product for home, any normal wifi printer will go out of ink and the cartridge cost will make it even more costly. But this printer goes on running, 6000 pages color and 7k × 3 that makes 210000 page printout with 1 set of cartridge provided by company itself. Only thing is that during initial install the pipes will be filled with ink so u will find slightly less page print but at this cost and efficiency it's a worth buy product. Print quality is great",5
"Hello friends, this is the initial review. I received on 12th August. What a speedy delivery by Amazon. Immediately I called the Canon customer care for installation. Thanks canaon for your intime installation.
I noticed ink is 1/4th done for 6 prints.
Need to check in the days to come.

I appreciate for ease in setup and getting photo and documents prints.",4
This has to be the WORST printer I have ever used. It's real name should be paper jam. It does not print more than 5 pages in a row and the whole thing jams and sticks. Have had it for about 3 months and the experience has been a nightmare. I spend more time ordering paper than anything else. I had thought making such an investment will support my work but instead I am not stuck with a really expensive printer that jams and sticks and DOES NOT PRINT in peace!! I should have gone with my gut and bought HP.,1
"Firstly, for 2 sided prints, the paper has to be manually reversed, and worse is that the printer keeps showing errors when trying to print the reverse side (error light blinks and printer stalls). This error occurs during 1 sided prints also though the frequency is lower. The print quality is borderline average (just about). Also, since there is no LCD display (why I can't fathom) it is impossible to debug in case of network connectivity issues.
Would strongly recommend buying another printer, or in case you are set upon this one, I can sell it to you for really cheap so I can change the printer.",2
Very happy with the quality of the print and efficient ink utilization. Black ink toner is not even half even after printing more than 2000 pages. Good part is the a couple of black ink toner bottles were part of original package. Best part is being wi-fi printing even from the phone or tab as well. Definitely recommend for home usage.,5
"The best printer at this price point. No issues at all till date. I was planning to go for PIXMA G3012 because of the built-in display on the top of the printer but the stock was out, so I bought PIXMA G3000 instead. After few days I realized the display was of no use because everything was to be done on the phone or laptop.
The print quality is good. (4.5/5)
Installing is very easy. (5/5)
The printer looks good. (5/5)
Connectivity is good. (5/5)
Best for HOME and OFFICE USE.
GO for it...",5
"The printer is very compact, a good fit for home use. The good this is even it is compact is has all the features, like printer, scanner and copier. The print quality is excellent. Installation does not take more than 30 mins, very easy to install. I can't say much about after sales service because I had been using this product from last 1 month and did not find any need for service.
Over all a very good product.",5
"Printing speed is quite good, printing quality is also normal. Wifi direct is something that catches the eye. Print from a mobile phone or a laptop without a router or cable, that makes it different from others. Printing is also economical. So no second thoughts if you are planning to buy an ink tank for home or office. I have used many ink tanks but this printer has really an outstanding performance.",5
"After watching lots of YouTube reviews about inktank printers like Epson, HP, brother and canon igo for canon Pixma g3000.
#After using 4days this review is posted
1) print quality both b&w and colour is good
2) installation process done by myself. with the help of YouTube channels
3) WiFi signals is excellent
The printer is used with only canon print app which works very good
After used of 3 months colour Xerox is not working properly. Colours are mismatches",3
"Worst service by canon, I am calling canon care from last 3 days still no one visited for installation/demo. And it's very difficult to connect to wifi even by following all the steps given in there manual(online demo also not usefull at all). Better to go for HP or Epson printers.",1
"Easy , just press and hold the wifi button and the power button blinks. Search and connect from phone using password at the back of the printer. Open selphy app and its done. You'll be addicted to printing mundane stuff.
Print quality is not bad and not great either. Its just acceptable.",5
This is the worst printer I have ever used in the last twenty years. The ink assembly pipe clogged up in a month and colour print stopped working. Canon believes in forgetting the customer once you buy the product. Please stay away from this company. You would be better off with a HP product or Brother. The extended service warranty is a scame. Use your hard earned money wisely,1
"No one from Canon attended to install the printer despite informing them on 1/10/19 itself over 1800 208 3366. Package eventhough delivered before time, this is taking a long time. Job card ticket no: CSP/20191001/1570204",5
"Old product or refurbished with scratches on it delivered. And parts of it are shaking like anything, no proper packing, directly sent without any bubble packing, printer not working properly",1
It is has very good print quality although installing it was the most brother some part and i only got black refill of inka colour one's very only one each no refills. But overall the print has great color print and as give nice scanning comparison with the price.,4
"Pixma G3000 is really a handy printer for home and office uses.
I used it for a week, I didn't find printing noises so annoying.

However after reading term duplex print only I bought this one.and disappointed to know it's duplex manual ( It's no duplex at all).
Other functions run as expected.",4
"It's a nice sturdy product. The packaging by canon is awesome. The printer was well insulated from all sides and although they had warned that ink from bottles may spill, the way it was double packed, there is almost no chance of spillage until one opens the bottle. This is an early review of the product. I will leave further feedback after a few weeks. The following are the pros of the printer.
1. Quick prints, both b/w and color.
2. Can connect vai a router ( for multiple devices) or directly using WiFi for a single device like smart phone or pc.
3. If u read the instructions chart given and follow step by step the installation is very easy, but you must have atleast some prior experience in handling a printer.
4. Optimum ink is provided in the bottles, such that not a single drop is wasted.
5. Once installed and initiated ( takes about six minutes) the printer prints fast enough each time, and we don't have to wait for the ink to fill in the print head each time( this was my misconception before buying the device)
I still have to try borderless photo printing to see the color print quality.
6. It came with two extra black ink bottles apart from the required set of ink. That itself is savings of about a 1000/- RS.
Cons:
1. It is heavy
2. I wanted a legal size scanner bed but this has only A4 size. Considering the footprint of the printer a larger scanner could easily have been integrated.
All in all a great product and I do not have any complaints from it yet.",5
"1. No information on yr of manufacturing while you purchase, the inventory was 10 month old stock which I could see post delivery.
2. Wanted help for wireless set up with iPhone from Tech support however never received the call back which they assured the same day.
3. Printer works ok",3
Looking at price can be considered as a good option as other company offers higher price with similar specifications. B/W print quality is well but colour photo is not as per expectation. 12-16 numbers of straight ( light lines) lines appears in colour print out . Service guy admit this issue and he has accepted this thing in writing in his installation report . Out of 5 I will give it 3.5 .,3
"Undoubtedly I love this printer Canon PiXma G3000 wireless printer..
Built quality is far better than EPSON L series.
Looks better as well.
Print quality is satisfactory. Plain Black n white is same in all these types of printers..
My concern was about quality of photo print.. I am fully satisfied with the result.. you can get a good quality photo print only if you know the process from where it needs to be print.. scan quality is average.. copying is most hassle free ..one key job..
Highly recommended",5
Within one year I have serviced for more than 8 time. I have purchased on 5th May but the warranty is being shown expired. Even the invoice of the product is not available along with the order or email or on your app. Pathetic service and pathetic product felt cheated.,1
"The product is very average one..wireless printing is a pain..Wireless printing, documents from phone is pain..takes 5 mts to read and print one page.
Print quality is just average..strictly for home use only..",2
"very good printer. could print so many printouts but still I could see ink is hardly reducing..
Photo print on glossy paper is also very good. Could easily connect/print from wifi.
But print from wifi would take some time to print but ok for home purpose.",4
It is an awesome product it works very well with the phone and the laptops on Wi-Fi connections. It is absolutely worth the money. And the best part is it is very compact in comparison to the other brand of Wi-Fi printers and the ink cartridges all inbuilt with no prone to external damages,5
"There is nothing to dislike about the product yet. Someone stated that the Installation would be very difficult. Yet I found it to be very easy once I followed the installation manual that came with the package.
As for the print quality its really difficult to believe that I am actually taking a print from an inkjet printer. It was as good as a Laserjet printer. So overall its a superb product. Now just need to check its Wifi ability.",5
Good product have been using it for more than 2 months. Print quality isngood for basic home and school project. It's wireless so can keep it anybwhere and take printouts from any device. Was not too easy to install but I followed the instructions on diy videos through you tube which helped me. The ink tanks seem to last longer and cheaper for replacement,5
Printer does not have any protection against mouse. A mouse cut some wires of my printer and it got unrepairable. All the component damaged as per service center and total repairing cost exceed 8000 rs,2
"Canon G3000 this printer is amazing ❤️ and print quality is super and using the canon printer app it always easy to use your printer and its print on A4 , photo paper , glossy paper is amazing ❤️🤩I have tested it.
Best printer for home use for sure 👍",5
"Printer installation and maintenance. It's costly to buy and costly to operate.
This printer gives bad quality of colour print as the printing head seldom gets choked with dry ink. Only option is to daily print (even if you don't want) or print head cleaning which wastes considerable amount of ink. Not preferred at all, I will not buy this again. Rather would be happy with any cartridge based simple printer",1
"I am not sure if this can be used for Commercial purpose but does on-par domestic home printing.
Have tried on regular A4 and glossy A4 photo paper, got best printing of the photos.
Gave 4 star just for one complaint:Paper Jam
I use 80 GSM A4 sheet , still some times paper jams.
apart from it, this is definitely the best printer on the market",4
"Have been using it for a 10 days now , the Canon Support Team was quick to come and set it up in 3 days after booking the slot. Overall product looks fine and it is not fast as the new line of printers. Scanning a simple text document takes upto 30 sec. Printing B/W doc takes upto 15-20 secs. But the pain is in the color printing , it took almost a minute and half to print my son's birth certificate.

Hope this issue gets resolved in advanced versions of this model.",3
"Please donot buy onsitego warranty with this product because these guys do not have any knowledge about anything, whenever you will ask any question to them they will simply route to the Brand.

Best we should buy plan from Brand, at least they will answer all your questions",3
"The product came on time and it is okay and prints good but the only issue I have is it show printer is offline sometimes when connected through WiFi
The scan quality could improve , I have been using the printer for a month now and ink is still at just below full capacity. Overall a good product but I think there is room for improvement 😊",4
"I liked the print quality, it was a bit difficult to install, as i was trying to install and print from mobile directly without the router. Later after connecting through router it was very good. But it will be bit slow while printing photo through wi-fi. i should test via connecting the USB cable.",5
Canon service is awesome. Installation Engineer came next day after i booked for installation. Installed it well and explained all the features. Print quality is good. No issues so far. Printing speed is little slow. May be in inkjet printer it would be like that. All n' all a very good printer. Purchased in 8999/- on prime day sale.,5
"Just received the product. It looks as if used before. no printer heads, empty ink bottles, ink tank 3/4th filled, smudged ink inside the printer, dusty inside and outside, package damaged, someone's PAN copy in the scanner area, not satisfied with the item and package.",1
"It is really good product. This is my review after using this product for one month.
Pros: 1. It is easy to install with cable. Wireless
2. All resources like CD ,USB cable are available.
3. Additionally, You Tube video is also available for guidance.
Cons: 1. Little Expensive
2. Wireless is little tricky.",5
The printer is good. The tech person also came within 4-6 hour to install the printer and helped us with all our queries. The software is not as good though but it will do the needful. Print quality is also decent.,4
"One of simplest and most cost effective brand. It is simple and non heavy drivers very easy to use. But without any display becomes tough sometimes to re connect to network. I bought one for office and one for home use. Both connect with same installed driver. Buy without doubt. I print after 15-20 days then also no prob
Only it don’t have brightness adjustment in copy",5
couldnt get through installation helpline number given in description. The printer is lying since one week on the table and not even a single print taken. It is terrible to install. There is no official video from Canon for set up and installation. Crazy amount of loops for trouble shoot. Free installation promise not fulfilled. Terrible experience.,1
"Initially I struggled to install the and operate the system..the help through phone by their service engnr also didnt help. But at last with the help of the service boy it all made easy...a good printer..print quality, scan quality are good..review after one month..",4
"One star less for documentation.
It took lots of time to do wireless setup on this printer, no where in the setup instructions it is mentioned that printer only support 2.4ghz internet.
Make sure you are connected to 2.4ghz network, this printer doesn’t support 5ghz network.

Otherwise printer is good",4
"I have been a Canon printer user for the past 10+ years. I bought the Canon Pixma G3000 printer recently. Very easy to install, sufficient ink supplied, print speed is good and print quality is great. Very happy with my purchase.",5
"Print is good but here r the some small issues
1) Wifi print is too slow
2) USB data cable is too small Inshort it just 3 ft
3) installing software for wifi is so difficult but little tricky for 1st timer
4) u need to have the bigger data cable to connect the cpu which is most uncomfortable thing to connect.
5) usb connected prints r awesome & fast
6) over all it’s good printer but 2 way print is bit confusing...still don’t know how to print both sides automatically...",4
"The quality of print is good as well as printing speed is quite remarkable. Canon as a brand has evolved a lot in different fields and as for photography sphere, their name always prevails. An integral part of it is photo printing and it nails this well. Only issue with this printer is wifi printing which is quite cumbersome. Hope it resolved soon via software updates.",4
"@Cannon G3000
Summarizing all I can say that it is
•Easy to install
•Easy to take Print via mobile simply by connecting through wifi
•scanned documents can print as perfect copy
•Can manage duplex manually

# Most irritating things
•Prints by mobile is not that good
•Level of ink drastically goes down after printing 38 b/w and 8 colour pages
• Too much noise (as the inner parts are striking each other)
•Technician support is always recommended for new user

But satisfied,as my work in done in few minutes .",2
"The product was delivered on time. No issues.
I am using a mac, and I faced installation issues. I was getting error messages. I had to delete the entire thing and redo it again.
WiFi based setup is little complicated. Need basic understanding of technology.",4
"There is some serious fault with the device. If the device is on, and a switch to DG happens, the power flickers for the entire house.",1
I connected my printer to wifi then I lost my internet access. What is the use of wifi with no internet access? All the documents are in the cloud but I can't print them without the internet. I have to download the document to my local phone then connect to the printer for wireless printing. This is not at all a wireless print option. This is misguiding and not worth to go with a wireless option.,2
"Hi.
I purchased it for my child online studies during pandemic. So it was used at home for studies purpose by my wife and child.
I had got a defective product. The problem was, on all prints there use to be lines, as times went lines increased. Child noticed it and told me.parent. and I calld the canon helpline they are telling me it's out of warranty and I had to Pay for all. I had got a defective product.
I'm really UNSATISFIED with it.",2
I am totally satisfied with the product. I got what I purchased. So far good experience. Only the setup required lil online assistance cd provided for driver installation. These days most laptops don't have cd drivers. I was able to connect via phone but file management after scan on phone is tricky.,4
"Difficult to connect to wifi router. Right now I'm using with Android mobile, able to connect through wifi Direct.

I was trying to connect to wifi router but no luck.
My old hp printer was working with wifi router.

can't connect the canon printer with my mac book also as I have only type c port's. cable given with printer is normal usb, so no use of cable for me.",3
"Good printer. Prints sharp texts like Laser Printer, hence no need to buy Laser printer if anyone buys this. Nice scanner generates high resolution images. Copy printing quality not 100% accurate but 90% accurate because scanner stick glows very bright white light and maybe it's common with every printers but the company should update their processing program to fix this. Canon mobile app do not have many features so use computer. So 4 Star rating.",4
It would have been good for there to be clear instructions that this printer is not AirPrint ready (ie any phone/mobile device can print to the printer without the need to install the Canon print app) and that it cannot do Duplex printing (ie print on both sides of the paper automatically).,3
"It is a great printer for home use. The setup was quiet easy but wifi setup is very hard.
If you want printer and save ,I definitely recommend it .
Great printer with good scanner
Good print quality.
Easy to setup for usb
Hogh speed printer which can print 14 pages per minute black and 9 pages per minute for colors
Cons
Wifi setup is hard
Great printer of setuup done by canon service center",4
Printer was good printing quality also good Connection is also easy all r ok. But study after 2 months printer has not working. I get blank paper. We mast use printer daily. Minimum 1 print we want to take daily I get that problem because of it,4
"Print Quality :
Black and white : Excellent
Color: Excellent on Photopaper
Color printout is Not so good on Plain paper!!

Black n white xerox very good and does in very less time!!
Color xerox takes time!!

Wifi connection is awesome!!

Overall go for this printer!!",4
"Packaging was poor,it came with the canon box only,no amazon seals,but just cello tape,printer had some marks on it.,appeared to be a demo piece.But inside was neat i.e with no inks inside the tubes and reservoir.",2
"Print quality is really good especially the quality of photo print. It was easy to install i did it myself after watching the video, working perfectly ok. The wifi Print connection setting is also easy to understand. Complete information is given.",5
I doesn't connect to the Wi-Fi router. You have to access it through AP mode. That mean you've to disconnect from the main wifi. And print quality is also not satisfactory.,2
Good printer without display. Wifi setting is complicated in this printer. Satisfied with the printing quality & two extra black ink bottles. For scanning no button on the printer. Overall a good printer.,4
"The packaging was bad. The product came to me with the packaging open. There were scratches.

The printer is good and i got two extra black ink bottles which will last for about18K prints. Print quality is reasonable good. No complaints on the printer side.",3
"Packaging material is a little on the cheaper side, this being a premium product (g3000), a wee bit improvement on the packaging materials just to match it's product standard would be great.",4
"After unboxing step by step proper installation and finally I try to scan document first time , it's not responding even not printing to Wi-Fi indicator is only flash Wi-Fi is not working , I install device driver on my laptop and tried to scan or print some documents but I face some error codes about scanner or trying to print some documents error also show printer is doing another job, job is queue
Very bad about that",1
Great quality product. Easy installation. Ease of wireless connection from laptop and smartphone. Best part is the ink tank is installed within the body of the printer. Looks smart.,4
Printer is good but self installation is little bit difficult. the service provider mobile number was not reachable when i called for installation. Wi-fi set up process seems also not easy. but if you follow line by line procedure then it will be okay. i am not much satisfied with the colour print for pictures on glossy paper.,4
"Received the package in good condition but while start the printer it shows some error and one of the light is continuously blinking, contacted the technical team of Amazon they said printer has some problem and to wait for one day for return

Now waiting for return",1
"This is printer is good from cost point of view of ink and per page cost is also low but product is not user friendly in terms of installation specially wifi configuration and tool for scanning a document or photo is also very poorly designed, it some times work and some time don't, started showing error ""can not communication with scanner"" and I have to restart again. HP printers have much user friendly app for scanner.",3
Have been using it for all purposes and it has been a gem of a product very easy to use and versatile also the low cost of maintenance and printing a must have for every home which has a need for regular printing and Xerox's.,5
The canon engineer came and installed the cartridge and filled the colors . But the printer didn't start. It has some problems internally. Sending it back to seller for refund . Don't mind the stars as I haven't used it. Will update for refund status .,2
"Everything is fine except canon guy telling us, ""Sir, print one page every week else ink will dry"". Wasn't that the purpose to buy this :P
Bot for 9100 in July 2019 in sale.",4
Excellent printer with superb features. Softwares are too good. The phone companion app is also good. Print output is fabulous. Overall a masterpiece and worth the price.,5
"There is a lag in product... Printing and Scanning... Sometimes it gives error...

Quality is black print is good but Color is just ok

Overall ok..",3
Never buy this product. This will stop working exactly after warranty period expires. I'm totally disappointed that suddenly it stop working and nobody could able to repair it. Print quality is good but this is absolutely worst product. This made a bad impression on me about Canon. Even other companies gives warranty period of 3 years while Canon give only for 1 years.,1
THE INSTALLATION PROCESS TAKES SOME TIME. THE SCANNER SOFTWARE IS VERY POOR. I HAD TO GET A THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE TO MAKE PROPER USE OF THE SCANNER . I HAD USED AN HP ALL IN ONE PRINTER EARLIER. ITS SOFTWARE WAS MORE USER FRIENDLY.,3
"Not able to do setup: neither through USB nor wifi. I really dont know. While setting up, my laptop is not able to detect the printer neither through wifi nor through USB. Now if i want to return the product, i cannot do so as the option is over as its been 7 days after the delivery",2
Installation is fairly easy. Additional black colour is a bonus. Takes a bit of time to print but it is not a deal breaker. Need to review again after a few months to comment on durability.,4
"Though the print quality is good and it uses less ink, if you use the machine occasionally, every time it preps the ink for a minute or 2 before it actually starts printing.
Also, the installation took me an hour to complete. I had to refer YouTube videos to complete the installation as the manual instructions were not sufficient enough.",4
"The Canon Pixma G3000 is easy to install and operate. I found it very suitable to my needs. A little bit noisy and slow, but overall good. The cost per page is quite low, which makes it the best and most affordable choice in the long run.",5
Printer is Ok. Takes good amount of time to start print once print button is clicked. But main problem is Wifi set up. I still couldn't set up printer on my Wifi ( I am using TP link Deco M4). Instructions mentioned wouldn't help.,3
"in this price range it is really superb..
easy to install and wifi connectivity is awesome.

best for home use. photo printing is good.

must recommended",5
With my PC....yes it’s All Easy ......but UNFORTUNATELY it doesn’t respond to my iPhone - I m told it’s not compatible with IPhone & there is no AirPrint app for it too :-(,4
"Brand new printer. Installation intructions totally inadequate. Diagnostic and error messages are useless. When one of the ink tank component did not seat correctly, the error message was misleading. Had to call tech support

Now I changed WiFi password at home network. There is no easy way to reconnect.

I connect it to using USB.. printer is not detected... I printed about 50 pages so far and it's not usable as I cannot even connect it. Cheaper printers from Samsung I had which are 1/3 the price were far better",2
"Good quality printer .easy to install .No issues so far.
Update
It's almost 2 months now .works great. Use it once every week for around 10 pages printout .The ink levels right now is still very close to top.",5
"Bad product.. Dont buy canon..

The board got complaint within the warranty period.. Hot it replaced.. Again after 2 months, the same board got complaint.. Now out of waranty...

The boards are having life of just 2 months and the canon people are reacting like that is normal..

Bulshit product.. Dont buy...",1
This is good product. But very very complicated to operate thru mobile app. Printer is extremely noisy as well. However overall I am satisfied with the product. Esp in lockdown times,4
"Average printing, not so friendly. To print from mobile, you need to download application, printing should be done from the application only. User friendliness HP is better.",3
"Canon G3000 doesn't support windows 8 platform.
Unable to install.

Canon on-call engineer was also unable to install the product.
Canon engineer tried different ways but he could install.
He guided me to change windows 8 OS .
Then only canon software will work

Things to note: wi-fy feature of this canon G3000 will only work if you have Wi-Fi modem.",2
"Pathetic product.. I have received a faulty product and when I tried to take help from Amazon, I have been redirected to canon. Also I don't know why is the replacement period locked for 10 days alone. Can that not be considered for genuine situation?",1
"Hi all, if you are looking at USB based connection, then it is ok. If you are trying to set this up on WiFi (shared network printer) - Good luck! Canon documentation is way out of date, and doesnt work.",3
Had ordered it for my office. For a ink tank printer the print quality is decent. The installation was quick & easy and very well facilitated by the Canon team for free. Its easy to use and compatible with Macbook. Got two extra bottles of black ink. Good Value for Money.,4
Thanks to amazon for such wonderful printer in reasonable price. Received it yesterday and same day installation by cannon representative. With the help of wifi it is Easy to use. Print quality is too good. Printing photo is wonderful. Till now no problem... happy with printer at such low price of rs 8999.,5
"I like the fact that you can print and scan from any device directly connected or connected on the same network wired or wirelessly. What I don't like is that if you switch networks, you have to do it all over again-like uninstalling and installing everything.",4
"This product is worst, I purchased this product 15 days before Now I am facing problem with wifi and internet connection, I called conon customer service department they asking for money for service engineer visit still my product under guarantee and warranty, very bad experience,",1
On 9th September I purchased a Canon Pixima G3000 printer. Several times I tried to connect it by wifi but the printer is not displaying. I think there is some problem with the wifi.,2
"The mobile app is little tricky to connect with printer.
The scanner app on desktop is not easy to use. You need to fiddle a lot to get proper resolution.
Printer is easy to assemble and good for home use.",4
"Easy to install with the instructions fold in. However, the print quality is weak. Moreover, even after pressing black and white button for print, color prints come. Also, the setting with mobile or wireless is difficult.",4
"Good quality print, scan, and copy
This printer has refillable ink-tank. So you can monitor ink level and refill the tank easily yourself.
I feel print speed is slow. Wireless setup process is very complex. If you follow the instructions carefully with patience then able to do. Otherwise, refer any YouTube video for wireless setup",4
Good print quality...Have printed around 20 8 × 10 photos and the ink level did not reduced much...Seems economic...Works great over wifi and cloud as well..,5
Canon is mentioning on product 6000 B/W and 7000 Color page but they are not defin whether it is print or xerox . I am using it and I am facing problem of consumption of Ink. For 500 xeroxing it takes whole Black ink tank and it is not affordable. So dont buy this printer.,1
In this price range very good printer. Installation is easy. Black and white printing is fast. Colour print takes a little time. Photo printing is also good compared to the printer price. Printing via wifi takes a little more time.,5
"It's an ultimate product for print/copy/scan.Economy of ink consumption and hassle-free printing through usb/wifi is it's unique quality.It is really owner's pride and neighbour's envy. My kids are at cloud nine, as they are getting instant photos of their funny activities and thumbs-up from teachers for their colorful project work and homework. Kudos to Canon for such a wonderful product and of course to Amazon for making it available to customer in time and at Rock bottom price.",5
"Now that I have been able to get the printer running. Love the output and speed.
However, the support is lousy and the numbers mentioned just doesn't seem to work.",4
"Printer is of good quality and easy to install.
Though I installed the printer and completed the setup. Onsite support person visited and explained every detail of the printer.",5
Prints a lot of pages with one full ink tank. The Samsung customer service technician team is also very helpful. They helped me with an issue I had with scanning and it was very quick. Definitely recommend.,5
"printer reached on time....good quality printer....but the electric cord connecting the printer with electric plug is very loose...causing problems while taking the printouts. Don't know whether it is a manufacturing defect or while packing the printer some other wire is replaced with original wire....
I need help from amazon people regarding this.",4
Worst printer. Unable to detect wifi. Canon service guy came and told mother board is not working and it has to be replace and it would take 10 to 15 days time. Really are you kidding me it’s a brand new printer how can you say mother board is not working. I have been using Canon camera and it’s really good that’s why I preferred canon printer rather than other brand.,1
Poor quality color print on normal 80 gsm white paper. Is it normally like this or is the printer faulty? Please advice. My friends are saying I should have gone for epson inktanks.,1
"The printer is not working and then i made the booking with Canon service team to install the printer. But unfortunately the printer having technical issues and service team will update us the next actions

This is my first experience that i bought the new product which is not working properly
I hope fast action will be taking by Canon and Amazon team",1
Excellent printer with beautiful and crisp prints. Being the wifi printer it's so easy to operate from anywhere if there is proper wifi connection.,5
"Giving lot of issues within 2 months, now in usable lot of error codes. Not at all user friendly. Installation and daily usage is very complicated especially scanning. Ok for printing. If u have lot of scanning to be done then would suggest to go for HP.",1
"I have connected it to my android phone and using it for 3 days. But i have not been able to connect it to my PC yet. I called up the customer care number and customer care executive helped me to connect it with my android phone. It's working well so far with my phone on wi-fi connection. Overall it is a nice purchase, and i will rate it not more that 4 stars.",4
I bought this in June and initially 1 month very happy with the product but now not at all happy with print quality and support from Canon. I called them to fix that print is not coming properly they asked me to do some steps over phone and half of the ink was empty and issue still persists.,3
"Awesome product all in one you get many balck ink boxes to be specific three which adds a really good value for money prints are too good scan is good . Wifi capabilities are awesome too good
One point installation is difficult but can be done by reading manual carefully
Highly recommend this product",5
Printer is fast and easy to install if you are a bit familiar to tech setting up of the devices. Print quality is a bit low quality on office paper when compared to professional quality. However prints on Photo paper are excellent.,5
"I brought this printer around 3 months back and now it is not printing black and white. When I lifted the printer cover to look at the issue, I can see an air bubble in the tiny tube that supplies the black ink from tank to the head. Don’t understand how it can happen as my ink tank is still very full.
Probably a flaw of design or a defective piece.",2
"it works well and i am really happy to buy this.....NO PRINT ISSUES .....take out print as much as you can ....low cost printing.....got 2 extra black refill....i am tension free for at least 1.5 years......""AMAZON CHOICE"" is really appreciable",5
"# Good Wifi feature
# Prints can be given using your mobiles
# No colour smudging and fading.
# Very bulky and not portable unless you have a car and also looks delicate
# It is a bit noisy.",5
"Yaa it does what expected.
Normal issues in inkjet like paper getting stuck or sucking more papers at a time heavy noise.
If you give more no of pages to print surely it will get stuck in between.
So ten pages at a time.",5
"Slow speed, Linux drivers hard to find, Average print quality. Wireless sometimes doesn't work. No auto-duplex.

Pros: Ink tank, no cartridges! The more you print the cheaper it gets. Scanner, copier. Compact.",3
"We received this product yesterday easy to install but no WiFi connect and no copy option, and no print just one copy..so I think to return go to new one Epson..",3
Not getting support from Canon in getting printer free installation as it is mentioned on Amazon that contact Canon service for installation. Toll number is referring a WhatsApp number which is Artificial interface. This is unfortunate on part of Canon and Amazon. Amazon must look into customer satisfaction also post delivery of costly items which needs expert support.,1
"Liked the ease to install and use. It looks and feels good. Prints excellent quality for texts. Image printing quality is okay, but not great. Another issue is that it needs head cleaning (deep) often which wastes costly Canon ink. The printer is not compatible with other cheaper inks.",4
Im a hobby photographer and I wanted a printer for lot of photo prints to take at home. This one is just perfect for the purpose. Color Studio quality prints at home.,5
"The printing speed and quality is excellent. Scanner is great and easy to make photocopies.
A very good product. Have not asked for tech support, so cannot comment on that.",5
"Not that great print quality , expect average from this as I have used other printers too, I can say this. Cost per copy is economic.",4
"Very good printer and excellent service by canon.
But the packaging by seller was not good.extra care should be taken before dispatching the product.",5
"Good Quality Printing at Affordable Price.
Installation steps were a bit confusing though able to go through - and print successfully.
Support Team should be more helpful -",5
"Bought this product a week back. This is what I've been able to conclude so far. B&W printing is good. Colour printing is below average. Installation is complex and time consuming.
Edit 1: After 15 days of usage. Pages are getting stuck. If you're printing 10 pages at least 1 will get ruined.",4
Product is good... But no installation support.. the toll free number is not working... Installed the printer with the help of YouTube. Installation is very easy.. For connecting to mobile and laptop is not so easy.. as manual in this box is useless.. but once connected with mobile through WiFi ...it is very simple... I find only 1 video on YouTube after searching for 2 days... And it's work fine for me... But overall it is good... All the photos are printed on normal a4 white paper...,4
"Easy installation(didn't face any issues installing on MAC as well). Good quality print. Initial cost is high compared to other kind of printers. But it seems cheaper in the long run. I have used just for a few days, so can't comment on tech support yet. Rest it's working superb!!!",4
Printer quality excellent. Took some time to figure out how to connect it to my smart phone for the first time. It was not so straight forward as the manual doesn't help. Had to search a lot online before I could get it started. Print quality very good though,5
Amazing printer. Easy to install. Intially unable to connect it with phone. It should be written in the manual how to change the mode of WiFi from router to direct. Ultimately solved the problem after watching YouTube video.,5
"The Cannon G3000 is perfect who is looking for printing in Bulk - more than 200 pages a month. Extremely cost effective compared to Inkjet printers.

The Cannon customer support is very quick and send an executive with 3 hours of raising a request.",5
"Print quality is very good.
I am giving 1 star because it is very difficult to install wifi in this printer.
Watched many videos, canon tutorials about how to change wifi password in the process wasted 3 hours doing it.",1
"Satisfied with the product. Good quality print ,copy and scan. Better to take the help of company persons to install as synchronization takes time. Ease of printing due to wireless facility. Equipment is little bit of noisy and have higher vivration while working. Anyway, this doesn't affect much. Overall a good product.",5
Good Service from Customer Care to install the printer. Quality of Print is very good. Huge discounts from Amazon made it worthy & no other online Shopping sites are offering such a huge discounts. Grab it when you can ! Don't miss it.,5
"Print quality is very good.
Scanning is also up to the mark.
Satisfied with the product.
Nice product from Canon",5
When i ordered i got defective product carriage unit is not working and later installation engineer gave some sheet as a proof of defective product and when i called Amazon customer they have immediately responded and gave replacement and the replaced product is working absolutely fine. Thanks Amazon 😊,4
The product is really good I used it for 3months now I wasn't feel any hard to use free easy and comfortable. Quality is good I really recommend this product easy to install the printer and print quality is very good,5
"Very bad customer service. Number mentioned for installation doesn't work, endless waiting and then call gets disconnected. WhatsApp based customer service has pre defined question and answers and hardly any helpful. It's been more than a day since the printer has arrived but don't know when it will get installed...",1
Never recommend anyone to purchase any product from Canon that too via Amazon. Both organisation in terms of customer handling are worst and worst. Canon is highly unprofessional and least bothered about customer. Even they mentioned go and return back to Amazon we don't even dame care.,2
"Awesome printer. Ink tank is simply amazing and the print quality and speed is excellent.
Easy insallation. If required there are lot of YouTube videos. Delivery is delayed by a day, but that’s fine",5
"Best for home, office, students for home study..go for it.",5
"The black coloured print is not even visible , it’s a pain to set it up , the air print doesn’t work well on IOS device",1
"Prince quality with installation is awesome. Wifi printing with multiple page selection and quality selection is added attraction.
The only thing which i realized is poor is print speed lilltle bit slow and for copy you have to puch buttoms again and again as no of pages to copy is not available there.",4
Tech support is pathetic ...it has been 10 days the piece seems defective and there has been no sign of action from the company's end.Mail mail only seems to be their favourite game sadly in this day n age.,1
"Dont but at all, waste of money.
Takes long time to connect and print",1
"Good printer easy to install. Got extra black ink bottles for refills. Scanning and printing is top quality. Definitely worth the price.
You save more on this printing rather then buying catriges which cost more!",5
"If this could been with double side printing then it could have been the best printer for home. even though it has latest future of WIFI printing from mobile, but not have dual side print will waste of paper.",3
Very difficult to install. Literally struggling to install and fix the wifi connectivity.,1
"Big drawback, this product doesn't have airprint facility & it has not been mentioned anywhere in the product details/description. Color photo print is average & not as per mark. Product is only good if you want to print B/W pages. Frequent disconnections with net & takes considerable time to warm up",3
"For a premium printer like this, it is a shame that this doesn't connect to my home wifi router (this is a basic requirement). I bought this printer because it mentioned that it supported WIFI. It looks like it only has its own WIFI (which is not Internet enabled). The product brochure is misleading.",1
"worth a purchase..
print quality is good
but im concerned about ink.
on the first install the ink level dropped so quickly and quit much but after that i printed like 20 photos on A4 size gsm 180 paper and ink level didn't drop much i guess it was first time that it took much ink.
scan quality is more than average .
it gives good output with good paper.",5
Good Budget Printer especially when kids are likely to stay home till vaccine of Covid-19 comes... lots of activity sheets would be needed.. and this printer offers great help..,4
Writing this review after 3 months of owning this printer. I use it at home for mostly printing documents. This printer is well suited for that. I also tried printing some photographs but they turned out very grainy. So not ideal for photo printing.,5
"Nyc printing quality, can print awesome pictures on Glossy photo papers, and supports fast wifi printing without compromising on quality
An all in one device !",5
"This is frustating...even after 7 days of delivery and raising a service request with canin and multiple followup no one turned up for installation.
Guys strongly recommend do not buy this. Worst service and Amazon won't help in installations.",1
It's very difficult to get it connected to wifi and to other devices. It doesn't print from apple products. It doesn't support all format of docs provided in the description.,2
Printer picks up paper from paper tray in inclined manner or misaligned way.. And paper gets torted and scrambled from sides.. .. There is some defect in new printer itself.. Not happy. .. Had to return the product..,2
"The printer has a huge problem of picking the sheets while printing. It doesn’t take more than 2 sheets at a time. Very inconvenient to use. If we need to print more than two pages, then we have to put the pages every time. Not recommended.",1
Very disappointing product. I have this for around two years. Many technical issues. Doesn’t pull paper cleanly most of the times. Periodic WiFi issues. Now colors are not working despite filling tank. Didn’t expect atrocious quality from canon.,1
I don't write long reviews. This is the best Budget printer for the family. Covers almost all the requirements.,5
I love this printer. Printing quality best. look is good and material is best. wifi connectivity sometime missing but overall i m very satisfied.,5
"The printer stopped working within 1 month of purchase. The canon service center is telling me that the part is in shipment since last 1 week.
Moreover when the printer worked for a few days the colour quality was not good. Don't think it was a good idea to buy this one.",1
"Print quality is extremely poor.
Fresh print taken in colour looked like an old faded copy of a print out from years ago. Would still have been ok, if the B/W prints were good, but they were not at all clear.",1
This is not a duplex model. Beware in product description it was mentioned as duplex,3
"Make alot of wierd sound before print.
Aftr installation, green light will blink, hold stop key for 5 sec. So that ink will start flowing to the tubes. No where it mentioned. Found in one youtube video. Hope it wil be useful.
Use 80+ GSM. 70 and 75 gave poor result",4
Pathetic printer. Its takes ages to print through wifi and even with wired printing it is useless. Total waste of money. If the company is giving it for free also then don't take it. It will just ruin you day everytime you use it.,1
"Awesome product .
class from cannon
I loved it. buyed for home use only
almost zero maintanace.",5
"After one month use -
printer installation is easy
This print quality is good.scanner is also average.
The installation CD come with the printer not is out of order/out dated software.
I face the problem to install software.
Overall use after one month printer is good ......",4
Print quality is good not professional style good but it is decent. Colour printouts came out to be slightly faded.,5
Writing the review after 6 months use I didnt come across any issues so far its all good. I felt this js good buy,5
"Fine print quality. Easy installation. I myself installed it. No problem. WiFi signal great. No problem. Good for home use and small business, office etc. You can print, scan, xerox. Bought it in easy installment. Nice one go for it",5
"everything with this printer is just awesome, be it the aimple setup, print quality, network connectivity and mobile app. Very economic printer with multifunctions for hime and small office.",5
"Excellent delivery, fast, on time. Product is very good in quality as canon described, packing is good and clear to see what is inside. Overall good experience.",5
"The ink dries up quickly and the head needs to be changed, The cost of head replacement is Rs 3800 for which you can easily buy an normal cartridge based printer. I earlier had a HP printer which i used for over 6 years without any issue. Will not suggest Cannon, as maintenance cost is very high.",2
Canon is trusted brand! Printer printing quality is gud. Easy to install and wifi signal r gud... plus point is that 2 black extra inks free with this printer,5
This Canon Pixma G3000 printer is best in this price range. And good for home and small office use. I like this.,5
"It's good printer. Print quality is good after some 100 prints, can be useful for personal and office work",5
Good product till now. Bought 4 months ago.. Go for it. Print quality is good. Connects with phone after turning off the phn data. Long lasting ink. Hopefully I will be refilling them easily. Printer + scanner+ Xerox,5
"Good printer, though old model. Not supported by many new apps. But an excellent choice for the budget",5
"Good Product for Home use..and for small office..
First print will take some time as the ink loading need time..,
Good WiFi and scanner..
Simple and easy product..
No.. issues found working smoothly.
Nice android app..,",4
Pathetic service by cannon in doon. Have been waiting for guy for 10 days now for demo. Please don't buy it from Amazon.,1
First impression are quite good. Installation is quite easy but setting it up on mobile was little difficult. Print quality good and speed is also decent. You get 2 blank ink bottles absolutely free which is really good. Will update this review after a month or so.,5
"Printer stop working with in one month. Technical support is pathetic, no one attended issue so far.",4
"no airprint support or wireless print support without canon app, useless in todays world.
hp is better in this aspect , it supports wireless printing directly without opening the canon app.
waste of money. do not buy this printer.",1
Amazing product.. Excellent a. D economical print quality.... Very easy to use and install.. Overall I am fully satisfied.. Thanks AMAZON....,5
"Quality of 4""x6"" photos and the general documents is awesome.
Only concern is the number of prints that whether it will meet its promise of 7000 color prints but it won't be less than 2000-2500 prints along with so many photographs which is more than enough for me !!!",5
"I wish to thank Amazon, for timely Dilivery, and that too making sure it reaches me safe and in good condition as far as the package is concerned, the Printer it self is awesome. Easy to install and I feel I got a good deal due to the Prime day deal. So over all very happy and Thank you.",5

I recieved cannon printer and installed by cannon service engineer it's working good and quality also good. Happy with this product great deal......,5
great value for money. good for school kids. meets all needs of a family very happy so far.,5
Canon customer support sucks. They were suppose to come and install the printer as I was facing problems paring it up with the wifi. They give a time and don’t show up. Expect people to wait forever. I’m returning the product.,1
First few months everything was great and now pink color is not printing.. few weeks ago black color had the same issue.. sometimes error occurred..I feel like I'm wasting my time with this printer and I can't trust on this printer don't know when it will stop working..,1
"Product is compact, installation was smooth, just that it make a grunting noise while setting up the prints. I ask canon to consider manufacturing printers wid diff colours like blue, etc dat r more vibrant!",5
"The printer does not has a display screen thats why its hard to get some of this things work at start, later you get used to it.",4
"This is great product with all in one product. Printing quantity is very good. Speed of printing is good appx 10-15sec per page from WiFi.
Installation is bit tidious for WiFi. Canon call service is better than home visit of engineer.

Overall better product and fits my needs.",5
"It's very excellent.!!!
Quality of print is very good.
Easy to install.
Only drawback is...no installation service.",5
"Print quality decent, speed is good, printing from mobile should have been direct though rather than through the app",4
Good,5
I received the printer today morning but what about the installation? It was mentioned in your advertisement that free installation will be done by brand. But no one has contacted me so far neither do I see any option where I can initiate the request for installation.,2
"This is the worst product I have ever purchased on Amazone.
Hardly this printer prints 5-7 pages, after that it is not working.

Hard to Install and pathetic product.",1
"The wireless feature has been a blessing, As there are multiple users.
The print quality is decent but not so impressive. Speed is also ok. I liked the installation process. It was super easy.
However, I do think that it's overpriced.",4
Been using it with mac for about 3 months....printer works excellent and print quality is excellent and I love the scanning options...canon has done an awesome job....if your planning to buy a printer under this budget...I would definitely recommend you this printer,5
"Well, just go for it, I initially had doubts regarding the quality and maintenance of inktank printers and whether laser printer will better, but this one proves to be best for moderate use.
Seemingly there is no problem of drying up of ink as sometimes I haven't used it for a week but it printed perfectly even after.",5
"Print quality is ok. But the print speed is very slow. Need to take print everyday, else print nozzle gets clogged. Requirement for any inkjet printer.",4
The Print Quality is Really Great for Pictures on a Glossy Paper. Overall its worth the Price.,5
Easy to install and use. Printing cost is less and photo print quality is good. Good for home and office use if you are planning to have moderate usage. It is little slow in printing and also makes noise while printing.,4
"NO TENSION AFTER INSTALLATION, ITS GIVES AMAZING OUTPUT RATHER ITS PRINTING OR CONNECTIVITY. WE CAN USE IT BY LOCAL USB CABLE, ITS OWN WI-FI, OR ALSO ON WI-FI NETWORK. IT ALSO USE FULL FOR COLUD PRINTING. IT SUPPORT 5-6 TYPE OF PAPER LIKE GLOSSY, SEMI-GLOSS, BOND, MATTE, PLAIN",5
Wireless feature is great. Can give print from anywhere in the house. .. Very easy to install.. The instructions are mentioned in the manual very comprehensively... Print quality is also good.. Overall a great buy at this price.,5
Bit tricky to install but with online videos its easy. Extra 2 black bottles free. Came in original box. Good purchase,5
Have been using for couple of months. Print quality is decent. No. Of copies will be high. Using for some time and black ink hasnt reduced significantly. Color ink i dont belive will gokd give very good yield,4

"I purchased this printer in August 2018, Its worth buying. I have been using it since August 2018 and its working very fine, WiFi connectivity is very good. Print quality is very very good ans print speed is also very good. I did not face any problem till date. I recommend this product.",5
"Photo print quality is below average, cannon application don't shrink image as per paper size",4
We've received a defective product. Scanner was not working and because of this the whole unit stopped working. We had to raise the issue with Canon. They got it fixed but we were not able to use the printer for first 20 days because of delay due to lockdown.,4
"Loved the printer, initial setup was a little tedious but following the documentation helped. Print quality (haven't tried photos) is very good. WiFi printing once setup is easy to use. Since this is an ink tank print costs are nominal.. Very good this far..",5

Excellent Printer...None to second..Go for it... Clarify ultimate and cost effective printer... Amazing Printer...printed almost 350 pages colour prints and ink consumption is very minimal...can take print using mobile directly through wifi..,5
"Stopped working after two months, no warranty .
As I purchased after the lockdown ends and went to my hometown after two months when I came back to my rented house, the printer stopped working. All the hardesrned money have been wasted.
I would suggest buying offline.",1

But keep in mind ink absorber gets full just after ink tank gets empty and printer becomes useless.",2
"One of the best decisions of my life was to buy this printer
Print quality is really good
Wireless connection is really convenient
Only con is print speed is a bit slow",5
No complains about the product... Using for more than 2 months... Without any hindrance... Quality of print is very good... Though cannot comment on photo print... Haven't taken any that sort of but all over great value for money,5
"This is not a network printer. The reference to Wi-Fi is misleading.
Also I have been waiting for the last 5 days to get the printer installed. No response from the tech team despite many calls to the customer care. Pathetic service.",1

This product got delivered well before time. I had made a request for an early delivery.. Thanks to Mr.Amit and Mr.Khalid( Amazon Managers). They both made sure that I got the delivery early. I'm really impressed by Amazon's team work. The printer has been a quick and easy set up. Print quality is good. Go for it!,5
"Best printer till this day. No problems where there. Good quality prints. I will suggest ink print like this than cartridge printer, if u are not at all concerned about speed of printing. Mobile software should be much more developed.",5
easy to install. i used net to dwnld printer drivers etc.( unable to install from given cd.)very user friendly.yet to check the printing capacity.nice one.,5
Really good printer worth the extra money compared to Epson and hp. No one can beat the quality of canon!!,5
"Canon customer care number is switched off

If a seller is selling other brands products, least they can do is either send somebody from their side or coordinate with canon directly to send somebody",1

"I am Writing this review after printing Almost 2000 pages-

Setup -
Setup was easy just go to YouTube and see the setup video. And also follow the instructions provided with the printer.

Printing (Major Concern)-
Printing was easy on WiFi and USB both. (I only use WiFi connection to print)
Print quality is good in color and black and white both
⚠ Initially ""Print head"" uses some color ink (about 15- 18%) to charge the head so initial page yield is less.but after that you get the almost same page yield as said.
Didn't faced any issue till now (No paper jamming , color bleeding, incorrect color output etc etc) Printer is running normally.

You will get 2 extra black ink bottle (Total 3 black ink) so for a regular home user it will be sufficient for at-least 15 months

It doesn't have duplex printing but printing on both side is very easy (Just follow the instructions)
The Only thing I will mention as a Con is the Noise , It makes decent amount of Noise while printing but i think all the inkjet printers do that

Overall its a Very Good budget printer.
Got at very Attractive deal during Great Indian Sale @ 8499 (after all cash back and discount)
Canon Customer support is also good.
In my opinion Its best in its price Range",5
Good product totally value for paid,5
I use fully glossy paper but photo print quality is not good. It is useful for normal use but not good for photo print on photo paper.,4

It been over 6 months i'm using this printer at my home.
It is being an experience to get it working and use.

Lets talk about the positive side -

1. Auto Power Off, but comes online moment you fire your print
2. Print quality is excellent (while i was very wary before buying this printer)
3. A silent printer
4. Per page cost ever on full color is in paisa
5. Its a wireless enabled printer (2.4Ghz) supported
6. The cost of inks bottle are very reasonably priced.
7. It can take print from mobile devices such as Android / iOS with Cannon Application installed via Wi-Fi Network
8. Very detailed troubleshooting driver and application

Lets talk about negative -
1. Buy this printer if you are a techi
2. Whoever wrote the printer manual was very techi and hence lots of steps
3. It will throw error 5200 / 6000 and ask you to take it service center ..
4. You will need lot of patience and glass of beer to do troubleshooting ..

Finally, It's worth the pain :)

Enjoy !!

Excellent performance,5
Good product at right price,5
"I received the product within the time span provided by amazon.The packaging was good.Installation procedure is provided on the canon website in a step by step manner.I got it up and running in around 30 minutes.The wireless printing and scanning works brilliantly with my laptop.For mobile devices, canon app needs to be installed.I also tried out cloud printing which does work but i do not use it frequently.I have been using it for more than a month now and am quiet satisfied with it.The quality of prints is good and the printing speed is decent.I do not have to worry about replacing the cartridges or in this case to fill in the ink anytime soon.Scan quality is also good.For an ink tank printer the size is very compact which i like.The main drawbacks would be that the printer is a bit noisy and the built quality is not very robust.Nothing that affects the performance of the printer though.The printer came with 6 ink bottles,Two black and one each of blue red and yellow.The picture of the print that I have posted is on a 6 inch by 4 inch photo paper with high quality settings.The price point is also good compared to other ink tank printers.All in all I am satisfied with the product and service by amazon.I would like to give a 4.5 rating but unfortunately that is not an option.",4
"I have been trying to install the printer for the entire day and seem to have done everything right. Even have looked at all the videos to confirm, but still I am unable to print and the green light keeps blinking. Have registered a request on Cannon website, but there is no confirmation by SMS or email. My earlier Rs 1,500 HP printer was brilliant for home usage, please do not buy a higher cost product and get saddled with complicated installations & glitches thereafter.",1
"The delivery was very on-time!
Just have a hand on the Printer and feels it serves its duty best. The instructions are bit confusing in the manual though managed it without any error.
The driver download in the manual didn't worked for me, so downloaded from another link. Setting it to my local WiFi router was very easy. Now I can print and scan wireless!
My Ratings :
1) Delivery : 5/5
2) Product Build : 4.5/5
3) Print Quality (on plain paper) : 4.9 / 5
4) Setting up : 4/5
5) Installing in Win 10 and Android : 4.5/5
[**UPDATE**] Hmm.. I found a small issue in the border-less printing. it always print with a small border at the bottom side. Not sure it can be fixed.",4
"It is a bit of work configuring the first time, but a breeze when it starts to work. Wifi works smoothly on windows and Android devices. A bit of a bother on the Mac. Forced to connect using the USB. Not sure of the problem. Since it's working fine with USB, didn't bother much to trouble shoot. Prints are good. Seeing the ink tanks can be an issue, as you feel it's getting over 😁. Don't think that's the case. I had used an HP in the past and was a pain getting a print out of it. Compared to that, this is quite hassle free.

Note 1:the instruction that comes with the printer is too complex. Follow the ones on the YouTube.",5
"Till now 1000+ photos printed in 6x4 size. Only issue with this printer is it leaves dotted mark on glossy photo paper. So matte, satin & luster papers are fine for this printer.",4
"Printer gave paper jam error after 1 month. Funny thing was there was no paper that was jammed. Complained to Canon who on quoting the serial number said that there was already a complaint logged on that serial number by someone else???
Is Amazon selling duplicate / refurbished products?
Anyways Canon said that they would send an engineer and I shouldn't worry.
Considering that my previous printer from HP lasted 10 years without any issues, this is quite a poor experience.",1
Got it delivered in three working days. Setting up is slightly involved. It's better to follow the videos provided at canon website than using the manual provided. Print quality is good. WiFi works well. Recommended.,4
"INSTALLATION IS QUICK. LOCAL SERVICE PERSON WAS HELPFUL.
PRINTER COULD NOT BE ATTACHED WITH WIFI.
I TRIED 3 TIMES TODAY ON 180018033366 THEY COULD NOT CONNECT TECHNICAL PERSON FOR ASSISTANCE. POOR HELPLINE SERVICES ONE HAVE TO KEEP WAITING A LONG TO CONNECT THE LINE AND AFTER WASTING 15 TO 20 MNTS NO HELP.
SHOULD IMPROVE THERE AFTER SALES SERVICES OTHERWISE NO USE OF PRODUCT. IF ONE DONT GET FULL USE OF PRODUCT THEN WHY ONE SHOULD PAY EXTRA AMOUNT FOR IT.",3
"Worth for money

After using 20 days I am very satisfied with the quality and features

* wireless printing is bit slow
* scanning tray is bit weak
*getting more noise than other printers

Color printing quality is not exclent

Awesome seller, he has replaced my first printer with new one because of issues

Amazon delevery is very very very worst, as I went to local warehouse to take delivery.

How to clime warranty and how to take extended warranty for my printer",5
Excellent when it comes to saving money on cartridges but worthless as wifi printer unless you are sitting next to your router with the printer. A little weaker signal doesn't work. Yet good save on ink.,3
"First Amazon product delivery on time with well packed with OTP option for secure delivery to right person. Impressed with process. I purchased product in Amazon Prime sale and they might have many orders same day but they have timely delivery.

Regarding product. It's very good printer as I am technical person so I have installed my self via help of Youtube Video.
In Pack I got 3 Black bottle (3 Color + 3 Black bottle = 6 Bottle) 6000x3 = 18000 B/W page you can print & Colors 7000 page. it's lot of page looks like you can open photo copy shop :).",5
"- Good print and scan quality.
- One star less for the cumbersome wifi setup and usability.
Also connectivity fails at time. Primary reason for purchasing this printer was for wireless printing.
- Lack of on-device display is a downside for printer worth around 15K.",4
"Great value for money, manual color settings adjustment is required for crisp color printing and image data lossless setting must be enabled",5
"My biggest mistake was going for looks and not the real deal....I went for this printer because it looks compact and ink tanks are inside. Another reason why I bought this printer was border-less printing feature. But.....after 20 days when I started scanning documents I realized how pathetic this printer is....I tried scanning a basic document with white background, and text in between and signature and stamp at bottom, and this printer simply isn't able to pick up the correct color. In document mode, the background color is white as per my requirement but the blue stamp and signature just fails to be picked up. ...I tried every freakin setting, tried photo mode for scanning, it picks up the stamp and signature but the background becomes bluish/greyish. And then when I print it, the printed document is of different shade compared to the original. In other modes, sometimes the details are there but the blue signature and stamp is scanned and printed as black. The same document I tried scanning with my nephew's Epson L355, and it so easily pickups all details while also keeping the background clean and white as it should be for an official document(also the size is small) Not just this I tried printing the scanned file from Epson printer on both Epson and my canon printer(same quality paper), and my canon print it so dull even with high quality ON. This printer is only good looks and nothing else...I dont know what is the problem, maybe a defective piece or over image processing which is spoiling the result but either way canon can't even do basic job properly. There are so many unnecessary stupid settings and softwares but none can do the job properly....and by the way i am geek so its not like i messed up the settings",2
Excellent printer. For installation Canon Engineer came and fixed it ( I sought support from Canon toll-free help desk). Print can be from laptop via wired and WiFi. Also from iphone and Android phones using WiFi/ WiFi direct. Received 3 color and 3 black ink bottles. Suggest to keep the printer near WiFi router for fast printing. Using 75 gsm plane paper.,5
"Why does printer not take the paper to print?
I bought this product just 5 months ago and now printer does not take the paper to give the desired result.
I am unable to contact customer care and to find the service center. The product is still under warranty.",3
"Its taken me a while and am still not able to connect this to wifi. Wireless printing via wifi is more secure that the second method they also show. Wish I had bought another printer

Update 2: was finally able to connect. Once it's connected, it works very well. The print quality is good. Files scanned can be directly saved on phone.",4
About the delivery it's really quick printer itself is good only initial setup n installation is not very easy took time but after that works like charm. If u r at quiet place u will find it noisy.,4
"Good printer at this price.
Very useful for everyday use.quality of printing is just awesome.go for it before it is gone.
Wifi printing is superb u can print with your mobile phone.
Good thing is the ink tank is inside the printer so there is a less change of damage to ink tank.
You will have a mark upto which level to the ink is to be poured.Good functionality at this price",5
Good product. Value for money . Got it at no cost emi .Easy to install. Wifi direct connectitvy is a bit difficult if u have wireless lan around. Beetter to connect through wirless lan..,4
Good printer... I have been using it for quite some time and I hardly use it once in a while... still the ink doesn't get blocked.... I suggest all home users must go with ink tank printers... The print quality is also satisfactory..,4
"It is a good product. However unable to do a setup via wireless router connection mode on my Android phone. Only works in direct setup mode.

Also paper jamming is happening right from day 1 ... not sure how to put the paper in.

Quality of prints is awesome though :)",3
I returned HP GT 5820 as this one was 10 cm smaller in width. I could set the printer up in 20 mins. Additional advantage is that it comes with two extra black ink bottles in the box.,5
"Just as advertised...
Easy initialization & setup
Wireless setup was a smooth ride.. now of the normal hassles associated with other network printer
Prints fast in normal mode and colour print is good.",5
"Took me awhile to configure the printer to work flawlessly with win10 but, once it was done, it's a very nice printer. Noisy but, thats canon inkjets.",5
performance found to be excellent as of now..... good product supplied as per expectations,5
It is a good product. Scan and Photo printing functions are great but i have personally not liked the print speed. Canon print interface and software are pretty easy to install and use and are a great utility. The printer also makes a lot of noise but overall a good buy.,3
"Good Printer - Delivered on time. Set-up was not too difficult. Ran into a minor issue, but was solved when I called up Canon Support.
Wireless Printing is a breeze. (Not sure why many reviewers have had trouble setting up the wireless printing facility). I am an absolute novice when dealing with any device, but had no issues.",4
"Print quality is very good but I think colour print is vary from Mobile to Computer
Colour print is better than Computer on Mobile phone ( By SELPHY App)",4
Very good and reliable,5
Having a lot of problem connecting it to Wi fi .. in fact still havent figured it out.. would be nice if anyone can help.. youtube support not helping.. Print is good..,3
Excellent printer,5
"WiFi connection is very difficult to connect Cannon service centre people are came and they don't connect , colour ink,black ink 1/2 tank ink discharged they are my time and waste the ink.",5
Excellent printer.. prints photos on glossy paper.. I tried 175 gsm and got it for almost 9k on offer.. so far so good,5
"CanonG3000 printer is excellent, and I suggest everyone to buy,only draw back is consuming large quantity of ink for printing",4
"Good printing, overall value for money. Wifi configuration is little tough. Canon support is pathetic however,but product quality is really good",4
"Print quality nice both on plain paper and photo-paper. Used it now for over 15 days. Printed approx 800 pages, both colour and B&W. No problems faced.No paper jams or double paper pulling. Mobile interface is also very good. Overall very good deal for Rs-8999!!!",5
I received the printer in given time. The setup is easy and the printer and scanner is working fine. The quality of scanning is very good. The printer is silent and the quality is crisp sharp. I have been a user of Epson printers from past so many years but this time i must say canon has come with a good quality product.,5
Faced problem for connecting through wifi. Canon customer care tech support helped me to configure in 5min. Printing quality is also good...,5
Good printer for home or small office.,4
installation process very lazy,3
"Bad service , got defected printer",1
Great Print Quality and printing fast like Epson... Photo Quality is Good... But Ink Drying Time is TOO Long... 70gsm Paper is not suitable for any Colour or Dark Print,3
Super product and excellent packing.,5
"Product good.
Software installation not very easy",4
"Color print is excellent. Easy to WiFi connectivity system. I bought ₹8999.
Best in price. Full of paisa vasul.",5
Very good printer for personal use as well as business.i am fully satisfied with canonG3000.,5
Very poor experience the product never worked after installation seems some duplicate sold on web site,1
After 2 months of usage my printer feeder is not working properly........Rather than this Brother T300 Woks fine for me without any problem at low price.,2
"Packaging not good at all from amazon.
Product is superb. Great value for money.
Efficient ink usage. Great functions. Superb",5
Good product,4
Good Product.,4
Junk printer,1
Don't ever buy Canon product. WORST AFTER SALES SUPPORT. You ll regret buying CANON printer,1
"Product is good but something is wrong in this product.
I wish to replace the same .",4
"Installation and Setup are very lengthy and confusing. Product Engg. could have made it simpler and easier.
Moreover avoid installation/Setup during non-office hrs/days as you will not get any help from Canon CUSTOMER Care.
Canon customer care are good for nothing. These folks are trained in English to utter two words repeatedly ""Sorry"" and ""Apologies"".

Try wireless setup and you will realize what a crap you have bought.

Honestly speaking you have landed up with the worst possible Product and Customer care on this Planet.
I wouldn't recommend this Product to anyone unless you are a loyal Canon customer.",1
For printing billd,5
Very good.,4
We had a epson l365 earlier and were not happy with its print quality and cumbersome wireless options. If you print after a gap of few days epson printer would need a print head cleaning before use to ensure good printing. All these problems are solved with canon g3000.,5
"That I am after prolong use write this review true with honesty as your also face below problems one day.

1. The Printer Eat Ink as a sucker worm such blood of you and in the initial first set up the Bottles in new Printer and go down to Half ink level.
2. The inside Formatter PCB card of Printer contains EEPROM Chip IC no. (416RT 533K ) which service mode blocked if you press buttons frequently and use canon Tool kit Softwares to correct Printer himself. Then after no PCB card available and if available, it cost Rs 2500/-
3. The Ink Absorber cushion pad which put in the back of the printer inside the machine, in just 3 months soak all four inks excessively for each print so much, and finally when it fully soaked all INK full with its capacity then printer gave an error of code 5B00 again to take Canon Service center and cost Rs 1000/-.
4. The Original Botle of Ink of 70 ml each of four-color comes Rs 2100/- which cut your pocket like a thief cut. if you use local bottle the Printer refused to Recognized it and gave an error of INK cartridge and stopped working to Print any page. it also contains ink level restriction attached which prevents to a certain level of iNK reached no Print may print until it fills up with Original bottles.
5. The daily not use of the printer for prints gets dry ink into inside pipes and air comes and then Printer refuses to work and goes in 7 blink error mode called Amber to Green and green to amber and not correct without service station of Canon who charged Rs 1000/- from you.
6. The Parts of Canon Printer not available and when anyone get out of order or stopped the whole Printer now called a Trash BOX.",2
"An excellent all in one printer. Setting up is bit of a hassle but the customer service through call is extremely helpful. The Wifi connectivity is good, but a tad slower compared to direct connection with the USB cable which is super fast.

The quality of print outs are good.",5
"So the canon G series printers are nearly same just have some different features like WiFi. So, if you think that these printers are cost effective then check this below.

1. Ink costs: 1880 rs for 4 bottles including black, magenta, yellow etc.

2. Print heads: color - 2000 rs, black - 1200 rs

3. 75 GSM paper: 0.48 rs per page, so printer warranty is 15000 pages so 15000 A4 pages will cost 7200rs.

Consider the two situations now.

1. When the printer is new - you get print heads + ink bottles, but have to buy A4 papers, so say you buy 15000 pages for 7200rs. At this time printing cost is only 0.48 rs, seems good to you.

2. Now consider the second situation - when printer heads wear down, ink gets emptied. Now buy ink with printer heads which will cost you 5080rs plus 15000 sheets which will cost 7200rs as told. Here total is 12280rs. In 12280rs you are getting both black and color prints combined. This comes out to be 1.2rs per print which is nowhere near the canon claimed figures which are in paise. 8 paise for black and 21 paise for color.

If you're buying this for printing photos then this will cost you even more as photo paper is expensive. May be 5rs or more per photo excluding ink expenses.

So, buy if these figures seem reasonable to you. 1.2rs per page color/bw is not a big deal but don't fooled by canon claimed prices of 8paise bw and 21paise color as these don't include the paper cost.

Overall it is a good printer at an affordable price but Mac users please stay away as this is not compatible with it.",5
"It does not have AirPrint connectivity for iPhone/ iPad. Even though it is wifi enabled , you cannot print it directly from mobile. You have to install canon app and all prints can only be printed from the app. Saving the file on your mobile is a prerequisite to print the file. So, if you are on a web page and want a print of the document , you cannot print it directly. You will have to save the page on your mobile and open the canon app , access the saved document from the app and the print it. Printing a document is a struggle. So having wifi connectivity does mean you can print at a click of a button.",1
"Well, this is my first review about any product on any website so far.I would rate the printer 4/5.I was using a brother DCP-7065 DN laser printer earlier, switched over to inkjet due to the following reasons;
1)Wanted to switch over to colourful/vivid printouts than printing only on monochrome, basically got bored over b/w :)
2)Better yield .Yet to confirm for canon g3000
3)Wished to switch over to one with wi-fi printing enabled, for that, even my brother 7065-DN also could do the same, but after being connecting the same to the ethernet port of the router.
4)Wanted my desk to be less cluttered with wires.The canon does this job brilliantly, all I have is just a power cable connected always to the mains (it has got an auto wake function)

So Finally the printer was ordered online after having a look at the real printer across various stores at Cochin.The printer arrived after 3 days and the packing was good.Unboxed the product to check for any damages, as i was expecting some due to the reason the printer was bit heavy (8.2 kg).But since the canon packing was good and sufficient, the printer was in good shape.
Took me around 2 hours to install the printer with ink/setup/test print.Would like to mention that the user manual/setup is not very easy as given on the canon website.Have to do some trial & error for fixing up the same.Initial setup for wi-fi took too long , just to figure out what is to be done.

But once setup properly, I found that it a good printer which is VFM.
Pros:
1)Auto wake function, even if your printer is off, it will switch on if you give a print command (provided, it is plugged on to the socket)
2)Fast printouts
3)Good quality scanner
4)Occupy less space on your desk
5)Less clutter on your desk, as it's not having too many wires
6)Less cost per print compared to inkjet printers (yet to be confirmed, will update later after a months usage)

Cons:
1)Too complex to setup
2)No ethernet port provided
3)No auto duplex
4)No ADF
5)No display panel

Also, the price is few hundred bucks less than what you get in stores.I also got 2 additional black ink bottles free.",4
"The setup process is a little tricky & you may have to iterate a few times to get it right. However, once it is setup, it is an excellent wi-fi printer, which you can locate anywhere as per your convenience. Print and scan quality is excellent and the ink should last for a long time. As compared to other inkjet printers, the refill ink bottles for this inktank are available from various decent local brands (in 70 ml, 100 ml, 200 ml packs) at very reasonable rates. Compare this to the extremely expensive inkjet print cartridges which do not even last long. I would highly recommend this printer to anyone who is patient enough to complete the setup. Good value for money.",5
"Good printer , in my case it is working but paper loading is not done properly . Sometimes it is trying to load paper automatically if switch is on.",3
"After lot of deliberation between this and HP410 series printer, finally decided to take a bet on this model. Received some good feedback from my neighbors which also helped. After 10 days of usage I am happy with my decision. Installation was little time consuming since we have to fill ink during installation which has some steps to follow. Printer came with clear instructions so all was ok. Prints are coming out crisp and looks like it is economical also seeing my ink level not dropping so fast. This fits my requirements of printing my kids school assignments regularly. Overall happy with my purchase and hoping that good experience will last long in future.",5
Not good wifi not good,1
Pretty good printer .. :) Ink tank is really useful.. no irritating catridge refill needed,4
"This is my first printer and Reviewing after 1 week use all things are good and nice the best part of this printer is its verry esy to install and Print speed over wifi is verry fast Comparing it from its other Compatiter Over all nice printer but App need to update for Duplex printing . You can see print Quality from the pictures I uploded All pictures are in Photo copy paper Shiva Picture is in keOnn 65 GSM and Other two are in JK Bond 90GSM so i suggest you for photo printing use good quality printer for better print and its also good for printing head's life .
Pros.
1.Fast Printing
2.Esy to Install
3.Decent Print Quality
4.Good Bulid quality
5.Nice Look
6.Compact Desgine
7.Hassel free Connectivity
8.Esy to Oprate

Cons
1.Verry Loud
2.Duplex Printing Option not presnt in Application

Can't say about After sale serivce saty tuned for further update .

SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH ""par kya kare bolna padta hai majbori hai"" 🙁",5
not able to install the product. no support from canon,1
"I dont want to waste more time on this printer so, here it goes

It's so expensive
It's extreeeeemely user unfriendly
It takes ages to boot
It barely supports MAC
IT DOESN'T HAVE DOUBLE SIDED PRINTING
WIFI PRINTING IS A JOKE, FEELS LIKE YOU ARE MAKING A ROCKET.. THAT COMPLICATED

NOW ITS SITS ON MY DESK, MOCKING ME, AS I HATE IT, EACH TIME I SEE IT.",1
"Everything works fine. The problem was in the installation and setup. It was difficult to get the printer connected to the WiFi. And after that, to print from your smartphone you have to use it's app but the app itself is so buggy. I can't print through the app because it can't open PDF files properly. Another app can open PDF files and can print it but android can't find the printer on the Wifi network even if the pc can.",4
"Do not buy.. gives lot of trouble in feeder very often displays false paper jam and remain unusable.

ink resetter costs a lot. If not done properly endup with 5k plus by changing the board.

On the other end the print quality is extra ordinary.",1

"Consumes ink as if it were as cheap as water, waste ink pads require replacement after every 3 months, maybe just go for an inkjet, kyunki ink pr paise utne hi lgne aur chalegi bhi utna hi. Go for Epson printers which i too use and 2 bottles have lasted me 2 years.",1
"Bought it almost 2 and half years back.. excellent buy... very good quality prints.. light on the pocket ..local support is prompt.. have suggested to friends ..they're enjoying it too.. .

Proved as a special blessing during the lockdown... kids used it in ample for their school printouts

A must buy..",5
"It's made my work from home environment a bit easier by providing fast wireless printing and scanning, I dont have to keep my laptop connected to the printer for such needs. Gives clear and crisp prints. Installation is fast and easy. Tech support can't provide details since I haven't faced any issues with the printer.",5
"The product works well within the first year of manufacturer's warranty. After the warranty period, if in case, it requires servicing, forget the printer. After servicing you need to service again and again so that it can work. This is the case with all the inkjet printers. This is my second inkjet printer. It does not get switched on after one month of servicing. if you are not a frequent user of prints, do not buy inkjet printers, you are just loosing your money. Go for a lower end laserjet printer which does not have such problems.",1
"Printer is not taking the paper straight, on giving print command, the paper is getting tilted and not going inside, in spite of all paper settings being correct. I am unable to use the printer. Brand new printer purchased, not working. Replace it immediately. I am thoroughly annoyed. Some ink trace also seen inside. If you do not replace, I will have to accelerate the matter.

Wireless access further enhances the user experiences allowing to print from any where any device.",4
"Really awesome product. It’s value for money. Anyone who’s looking for a printer with budget and long lasting simply go for it.

Honest review.",5
Please don’t buy this product for this prime day deal because they have bumped up the prices ....earlier back June selling at 11k with additional 1750ea cash back from Citibank. Now it’s prime day they are making on this product seeking at 13k not worth,4
"Dont waste your money on canon.

I bought canon and hp 5180 at same time.
1. The print quality of HP is far better.
2. The Software of hp and printing utility of hp is way ahead
3. This Canon broke down twice. Heads had to be replaced. Not a single problem in HP even though it is misused.
Hp over all is far far superior product and technology.",1
"Awesome Product. Low cost, high quality printing, borderless printing, direct WiFi, easy to use, low maintenances. Easy to install this product.",5
Nice product...I m using it in my class..very helpful in daily teaching...nice print quality on A4 paper and photo copy on glossy paper...also wi-fi connectivity is very good feature which can help me to direct print from phone....not need to start pc or laptop each time.,5
"The product is worth the price. Gives Wifi Printing Access, in addition to the document feeder and tray. This more of a small business printer than a home office printer due to the sheer size of the printer. The photo printing works well, not 100% of in store print quality, does the work well enough.",5
"Reviewing After 1 year 3 months . Colour printing is not working . Tried everything but needs service support which is very Poor . Print quality And Printing cost is way too high . Don't buy Canon if u r from Balangir , Go For Epson as it provides ample tech support where as canon won't .",1
"I loved the quiet mode to print and scan at night time. A 50% reduction in printer noise is just wow. Overall, excellent print quality, easy to install, wifi printing and scanning took some time to figure out setting the apps and connecting to printer, once done everything operates flawlessly.",5
"Printer is very good and print quality is also good after all it's canon.
But I faced only one problem that the printing speed is very slow..
As mentioned 8.8ipm or 5ipm I don't think print speed of that much..
For normal draft b/w printing it is 4-6ppm and for color it takes more time which is slow for me.",4
"I'm personally using this printer from last few months and the quality is simply amazing.

Though I have not purchased it on Amazon. I bought direct from Canon.

But As I can see here now the price of the printer is better on Amazon.. :)",5
very very poor product -- does not connect to the wifi -- even though it promises so many additional features,1
"While printing from Android application we do not get options to edit the image or document. Hence zoom and print , crop and print is not possible. There are no editing options in the application.
Also the first print takes considerable time. Rest after 1 week use there is no other functional issues. We can print over wifi from the application which is a advantage.",3

"Print Quality Good, Delivers exactly what it is meant for, very less usage of ink, intial ink gets loaded so it feels like half of the ink is gone, and how it will print 4000 prints as promised, but does print.",5
"Not that good as claimed by others.
Pros:
Ink tank
Cheap ink
Easy installation

Cons:
Print quality is not good, not better than laser printer.
Printing Scanned documents are big hassle. It will stop printer half way through.
Body is very fragile. Very cheap plastic.
Mobile application is useless you cannot print manual duplex from mobile printing.
WiFi sometimes stop working. I called canon they said there is no big deal about it.",2
Does It supports automatic duplex?????.... Please. Suggest me inktank printer. Under 17000( any company)🙏🙏🙏😓😓😓😓,5
Excellent Printer. Economy too. I recommend this. Good Service by Cannon,5
I have bought this printer from shop it's very bad printer it's not working after 5 time repaired by canon canon service very bad they take one month in repair in one time. Printer head and main replaced but not working. Head replace three time in warranty and total print and photocopy only nearby 1500. So don't buy and waste your hard money,1
Printing speed is very poor. You cant get even 5 B&W pages per minute. Everything else is fine. You should go for Epson 3153 instead of this.,1
I would recommend this product who searching for all in one printer. Value for money. Print quality is good. But little bit noisy when printer is taking paper from tray. But that is not an issue. Overall good product,4
Print quality is good. Easy to install and use. Color print is nice. Overall performance is very good.,5
"Heads keep clogging. Cyan is not working at all. Customer service is really terrible. Throwing it away in scrap. Easy to use, but doesn't work properly ever.",1

"I have g2010 it's printing quality very bad. photo Printing quality very bad.............

bad bad bad bad",1
Printer breaks down often. The servicing people cant solve any problem and dont know half of the things about the printer,1
"Loved the idea of the ink refill and how many pages you get out it. However.....

Cons:
- Can not print duplex and with MAC OS you can not even choose to print a manual duplex. Using twice as much paper seems wasteful. I now have to carry 200 pieces of paper instead of 100 when printing reports.
- Can not air print from mobile devices. Must download an app and print thought it. BIG inconvenience if you are trying to print a document from the web.

If both of these issue can be resolved I would rate higher.",2
still no able to install wifi and phone printing. help line number not workig/responding,1
"AFTER 6 MONTHS YOU WOULD REALIZE , NO SERVICE , PAPER STARTS JAMMING , SPARES TOO COSTLY . OVERALL BAD .",1

"Really worth the wait! I got it for about 3,400 lower than the actual MRP. Received the printer in 5 days way before the expected delivery date, was not expecting that!
The printer is amazing, the black and white prints take about 7-8 seconds approx. Colour prints take a bit longer. I have also tried glossy photo paper and used it on ""bordeless mode"" which is amazing.
The best part of the printer is that it occupies hardly any space as compared to other brands. And plus you get 2 extra black ink bottles which ensures you will not run out of black ink!
Overall it's a really good product for the price I got it at!",5
Good print quality . PHOTO printing is also excellent. . ALL in All go for it,5
"The G3000 is just plain Awesome! Canon is the real deal when it comes to satisfying the customer.
The Printer works great with Plain Paper but it Shines when its fed with even a non branded photo paper.
The Ink Tank system is the best Printer System I have seen in a long time.
The best feature is that on an A4 Sheet it can do Borderless Printing.
To top it all up Canon gives 3 Black Ink Bottles free and 1 each of CYM.
The Wi-Fi feature is also a rocking one as since the time I have unboxed the cable to connect it to the PC is still sealed and I am using the full feature set without any problems, even printing from the phone is Fab!!",5
"I bought this printer in that market 13200 one month ago .That printer is overall good reviews are these
Printing is fine good quality average 8to10ppm
Scan is better
Copy is fast
I use my Android mobile connect this all works like copy scan print.
This is a photo prints also quality is good whith right gllosy photo paper.
Cons
Printer tak 5to 7minut starting it when it on time .
Installation time and rifling time is 2hour something it gives 2k to 2.5k black print colour print not sure for any query anybody mail me khajansingh52@gmail.com",4
It's good for printing on normal paper. But on photo paper the images faded away in just 1 week. Such a pain! You can't trust it as ypur momory preserver. In the similar price bracket Hp has a Ink tank model GT5820 and it's print doesn't fade. Choose wisely.,3
Not good printer,1
"After six month mother board has failed.. Worst Service response .. we are not expected from Cannon

Don't Buy ..Waste of money",1
"Horrible printer. Dont buy.
Buy Hp 5820 instead.",1
It is a Herculean task to make this printer ready for printing. The wi -fi system in canon printers is very complicated and almost impossible to install. There is no help from dealer. The cord for connecting to computer is very short. I had to buy a new one from market. The worst is customer installation manual which is inadequate and fails to guide customer.,1
Very bad. Never buy it. Money loss .all product by canon is very bad .service centre is bad.,1
"Canon Pixma G3000 All-in-One Wireless Ink Tank Colour Printer is the perfect solution for all your printing needs at home be it documents or photographs, the Print Quality is amazing and it is true value for money. The tank once filled with the 3 colours and black ink really lasts for a long duration of time and you also get 2 spare black refills. Just download the Canon Pixma App and go printing all your documents or photos without any breakdowns, no headaches of refilling any cartridges, easy to print over wifi, true Value for money.",5
"these inkjet printer is worth the money it prints scan and copy all in one at a great quality and fast i wasted my money buying cheap hp inkjet printer and then that hp printer need to change the cartridges very often and the cartridge was also very expensive but this printer has ink tanks and the efficiency of this canon printer is very very good also connecting this printer to home wifi is also very easy and can print from anywhere if connected to that wifi, the cannon support is best and the installation with demo was provided on time",5
Useful for printing at home. Quality of print is strictly average - not sharp enough.,4
"I had to call customer care for installation,as i failed to do so.During purchase,installation by service engineer should be a part and should auto activate after item delivery.product is now fine.easy to use from mobile.good print and scan quality.",5

"I ordered this for about Rs 11000 in May 2019. It arrived and we had some setup issues but they sent an engineer who fixed it in 2 days. So they have good customer support. Since then we have used colour print outs and done 1000+ pages of print outs but we have had to change the ink just twice. The second ink round just got over. So that's how good the printer is. the quality of print outs are good but speed is concerning as it is not exactly fast. However it does the job if you have a patient manager/assistant on the job. Overall, i am happy with my purchase. I also own a HP laser printer and that is also amazing though it is only black and white. The canon colour printouts are good. I can safely recommend this to the buyer in the market for a stable setup.

Do click like if i helped.",4
"Bad Printer.

1. Canon person took 3 hrs to setup wifi btw Printer and System
2. Color print quality is very BAD
3. Dull black prinout
4. Frequent disconnection of Wifi and stops print
5. Very noisy
6. TRY PRINT WITH YELLOW COLOR BACKGROUND AND BOLD BLACK LETTERS and YOU WILL SEE INK IS SPREADING and when I complained about same then Service Center and Regional head said this is Specification of Printer and doing nothing about that.

BE AWARE OF CANON.

FROM PRINTER TO SERVICE EVERYTHING IS BAD",1

Good nice and beautiful and easy to install very easy,5
Used printer supplied. today canon engineer visit for installation and found that printer is used one.,1
Always problem in this product,4
"Highly annoyed. The seeker thought he would be able to cheat by packaging the product in such a way that he would be able to hide all the defects. It looks rather like a 3-4 year old second hand printer. The lid was broken. The parts looked worn out
There was no cartridge and USB cable in the box. I would rather buy from official HP site. It’s also cheaper over there

This is in addition. It’s been over a week and the return has not been made so my money is stuck so I would recommend you guys not to buy from Amazon. I am one of the unlucky guy whose money is stuck. You could be the next one. I have called Amazon more the 10 times still no update from them.",1
"Do not purchase this product. Waste of money. It is having cartridge issues. Even though I installed SETUP cartridge which came along with the product, it is showing error to install SETUP cartridge.",1
"Works very well! Print quality is good and speed also good. Works like a charm on wireless network via mobile app! Not tested via USB yet.

Arrived on time thanks to amazon logistics!",5
"I don't know why people complaining about the speed of the printer. The printing speed is well upto the mark, even above the mark if it is printing in draft mode. Obviously it is not a laser printer.
Installation is hassle-free. Connection is very stable (have not checked USB connection). Print quality is very good. I have also printed from different devices like mobile, laptop and tablet. Only thing is that for android devices, it is by default changing quality to Normal Mode, not Draft mode.
Regarding cartridge, till date I have printed 20-25 A4 pages including 5-6 colour prints, still the printer is showing the cartridges are full. Will update when the cartridges empties.",5
"This printer is just a way for HP to make you their customer so that you have to buy their expensive cartridges (800 rupees) every week or so. One cartridge is able to print only 25-28 pages which makes the average cost of one page to almost rupees 30/page. This is the worst investment you can make for a printer. Don't get manipulated seeing the cost of the printer as eventual costs of running would be too high to sustain. Also, the return window closes in 7 days so until you realize how useless this printer is, the window will already been closed and you're now stuck with a useless, too-expensive-to-run printer.",1
"Very cheap material used for paper feed tray holder. It was broken on first use to hold papers. The two pieces that hold the paper tray to an angle were already broken. Packaging was not sealed at all.
Interestingly printer was wrapped in a plastic cover making it look completely unused but it is hard to say if it is a refurbished or reused/returned product.
Print Head alignment does not work easily.",3
I had huge connectivity issues and the there is no response from service of Hp . Pathetic . Don’t buy,1
Very good for home use.I am enjoying it well.Refilling shops are very less for this catridge which is the only problem I saw,5
Good print quality but installation process is very mind disturbing because when we want to give print via our mobile and at that time you have to face many problem in installation.,5
Suitable for home printing. Printing done only after connecting to computer. Wireless feature does not work.,3

Randomly thros up an E1 error which is paper eroor. Anytime you try setting A4 as the paper size this error pops up. Unable to use the printer,3
"Don't buy this product. I bought same printer which has manufacturing defect . I raised a incident with HP but there is no resolution yet . HP is very poor in providing services .scanning is not working and to print one page , it takes 10 min . Most important , HP doesn't care after sales",1
Best printer in Market. I will recommend this purchase to everyone. It is worth the value of your investment. Go ahead,5
"Best home printer, very useful, worth to have it. It is a very cost effective product . Print very well",5
Broken printer. Replacement has been such a big hassle that I had to cancel and return. Scanner glass completely shattered om delivery.,1
"Within 2 hrs of purchase i realized and experienced that running cost of 6075 is BOMB. In a rate of if you keep printing 10 pages Blank and white and 5 color daily., cartige will drain out in week. So, maintenance Cost would be 6,000 Rs per month., as good as buying monthly printer.

Other issue:
Makes lots of noice
Printing is not crisp, has shades
Slow printing

Demoed issues to Amazon support and asked if i can get replacement for other models and they said per policy they can replace with 6075 but not other models.
Any selling has to help customers and their satisfaction, but here even if customer is offering more money for better product, Amazon is not willing to exchange.

Honestly, get any printer which running cost is low and print quality is good and fast.",1

 Happy with the advertised features like auto duplexing of prints, printing with mobile, laptop over WiFi using the HP App, scan and copy. The most unique feature that I noticed while using the Printer, is the paper storage tray-box. The papers are stored in a box that is like a small drawer near the base of the printer. It’s like a hidden box and to me, it’s a nice invention to keep the papers tucked neatly and dust free. When it runs out of paper, apart from the notification that you get on the app, a light also starts blinking to remind of paper shortage. Also, the printer makes nice sound (wind chime) when it starts and also when it is turned off. A blue light keeps emanating from the point where the paper comes out after printing the documents and the light looks awesome and cool. In the past few weeks, I have taken over 200 prints and the cartridges are still holding up though the printer has been showing notifications of low ink level for last 10-12 pages. Not sure, if this helps - but you will need to disconnect from WiFi and connect to the printer when requesting print from laptop or mobile or tab. Another cool thing is, you can setup a unique email address of the printer and send a print over the email. I have not tried this feature yet but will do so in sometime. Attached are pictures and video for reference. Thanks
PS: deducted one star for little struggle that I faced during installation as instructions were not clear and had to download updates and trouble shooter to complete the installation.",4
This is the latest model of HP printer launched in 2020 and the design is sleep look Compared to the old model also the led notifications are futuristic. Connects perfectly and the print quality of the paper is Good.. If you see any change is the warranty it might show bit old but when you call or check in the virtual chat it will reflect correct with your serial number. Will post my second review after a month to see if any issues in the future,4
"Looks classy & does the job well. No complaints!

People complaining about the ink getting over quickly should realize that cartridge that came with the printer is a ""starter"" cartridge. The actual HP 682 that we would need to buy once the starter cartridge runs out would last much longer.",5
"The products build quality is superb, installation part is easy, but there are zero controls on the printer itself and all is controlled through an hp app, the color toner gets finished faster than you can imagine... Only 20 color print outs and it's already gone... So printing colored is expensive. Would recommend people to go for ink tank options as this one is having expensive printing.",3
"Jan 05, 2021
So far I've printed only with regular paper and the prints are good. Will update the review about print samples when I get some good paper and print.
Ink - runs out pretty fast. After some 12 to 15 prints the colour ink level is down by 10% so I'm guessing it will give me a total of about 100 prints before cartridge replacement is needed. thats about 7 to 10 bucks per colour print... not bad because any shop prints colour A4 for about Rs. 30 to 50 and this prints much better quality than the small shops that do these prints.
WIFI - this is the most amazing part about the printer. Tried printing via Wifi from iPhone, windows 10 laptops and Desktop, and from Android phone and it works perfectly.
Size and look - its really compact and looks slick! I looked at various ink tank printers and finally decided on this because whats obvious from the numerous reviews out there is that ink tanks are for the bulk printing folks. We will print 2 or 3 prints per week and at 7 to 10 rupees for a print in colour with all the features this printer offers us unparalleled value.
the ink tanks seem to print duller colour prints because that for bulk low cost printing and not for a discerning buyer. So if you are looking for the best prints in a 10K printer then this one is hard to beat!
will upload photos of print soon.
Auto duplex printing is an added advantage and works well too...",5
"Printer is super easy to install. All the functions like copying, scanning, printing can be performed smoothly. Built is strong. Cartridge installation is also very easy. One can easily set up the printer by following installation guidelines on the HP Smart app. And one can also choose advanced settings on the app and it will take the user to the HP website. The user needs to log into the account and there are a lot of options for settings to choose from. Make the most of the app features to utilise the printer to the fullest.",5
"Printer looks premium but it functions erratically. When papers in the tray are less than 15-20, it won't recognize the same and we have to add more papers. Even after adding papers it will show error and than we have to clear the ""paper jam"" by opening the top cover of the printer (though physically there was no paper jam). Moreover 1st page printing takes longer than the expected time.",3
"Best feature is auto-duplex

Wifi works flawlessly

the lighting and sound features make it look premium and cutting edge.

fits really well with the aesthetics of the room.

idk why people are giving it a bad rating. i was reluctant to buy it looking at the ratings, but then i saw some youtube unboxing and bought this with fingers crossed. Im more than happy with my purchase.",5
"It was easy to install. Took just 15mins to complete the process. Print quality and speed looks okay.
They provided only starter ink cartridges so I suggest people to not judge the printing cost per page by using starter cartridge.

Need to check after using originl cartridge for the cost effectiveness.

Overall, I found this printer good. It is the only model with auto duplex (2 sided printing). So I am happy about it.",4
"Very budget friendly yet very economic printer. We get auto duplex printing below 10k price range which is the main point inspired me to purchase this one after reviewing so many printer models from different brands.
One may think that cartridge type inkjet printer may not be economoc when compared to ink tank inkjet printers. Well partially it is true when your printing volume is very high compared to occassional printing.
One thing is that this model comes only on white. Hence, care has to be taken to keep it clean. Setting it up is very very easy. Before everything you have to download hp smart app in your phone. It supports Bluetooth printing also. Hence, turn on the Bluetooth first, open hp smart amd it will detect your printer. Once hp smart detects it it will ask for you to setup wifi connection for your printer. Requirement of laptop is not essential to setup this printer. That is one of the biggest point of buying it. A mobile/tablet/ipad is enough to get things done.",5
"Strictly for home user who wants no headaches and prints occasionally. Very easy to setup using HP smart App. Did not face a single hiccup while setting up or using it till now.

I have taken around 30 prints till now, print quality is very good. Build quality is very good, scan lid could be more sturdy. contemporary design, look and feel. Paper tray is tucked in at the bottom very nicely.

Print speed is Ok, not great and not bad either. Duplex printing is awesome. Scanning with high resolution takes time, but usual day-to-day documents which we want to scan with medium or low resolutions, the speed is decent. It came with starter cartridge, so cant expect it to last long,

If you are using office laptop for work from home, Its better to set it it up first time using your personal Mobile first. Install HP Smart App and set up the printer. Once done try using add printer wizard in office laptop and add it. HP smart app might not get installed in office laptop as most of the time MS App Store is blocked.

Printer maintenance (cartridges) is a not very economical. But for a low usage home user it does not matter would not even notice it. For a low usage Home user who wants all features (Auto Duplex, document feeder, scanner, copier, High quality prints) with great looks, compact design AND is not too pricey this is the best fit.",5
"Worst product from HP. Even though I managed to print 3-4 pages, the printer failed to initialize right from the moment I switched it on. Even HP engineer visited my place that too AFTER 8 DAYs(lodged complaint on 9th Nov 2020 and he came on 18th Nov 2020) of complaining and gave up on it saying we'll issue a DoI and take the product back.",1
"I will mention only one point which is horrible,in this printer according to me,u cannot connect it via USB cable only,it won't work,u cannot connect it with cellphone or laptop directly via wifi.It will connect only with a third party wifi signal to which the laptop or signal is connected.lastly the worst part u cannot connect two devices one after another if u connect second device then the first device won't connect again.Start up is also very slow and takes a lot of time,there is no screen on the printer touch screen panel",2
"Cartridges are outdated (just like filament bulbs in the age of LED bulbs). Check the cost from HP itself:
Cartridge: Rs 5 per page (see below for more)
Ink tank: 18 paise per page
There is no comparison !!

The above cartridge cost as per yield of the HP 682 cartridges ~ 480 pages (Black & White) & ~150 pages (Colour). This is like a petrol car giving 30kmpl in city traffic. It is less than half. If you get 200 pages (black - Rs 792) or 75 pages (color - Rs 972), you are lucky.

HP is fooling people by still selling the cartridge printers. These are best seen in museums.

~*~",1
"I was delivered HP 6075 printer with only one black cartridge installed. The colour was missing. A brand new hp printer does not have cartridge installed, else how will we know if the cartridge inside is genuine not refurbished. Amazon support team is excellent in helping with return. But this kind of experience is bad. Eventually I will be buying offline from one of the malls.",1
The printer does the job as in the description. The reason i chose this model was only because of the auto-duplex feature which saves a lot of time and effoet. No problems whats so ever. Had a complication in setting up the printer for wireless access. The connectivity is not consistent. You need to assign a static ip address to the printer for it to work properly. Apart from the wireless connectivity there are no other complaints I've.,4
"After reading the mixed reviews about print quality ,installation and catridge issue, I was a bit skeptical to buy this printer. But after using the printer for a week now, I can say it is the best choice I have made for my needs of home printing. The printer is very nice, sleek and is light weight. Installation was bit of a struggle as there were no clear instructions and I had to google to figure out the steps after the app is installed on phone. But once it got connected it has been running smoothly. I have used all the functions - printing, scanning and copy and all are working smoothly. I would recommend this printer for people who wants a printer for home i.e for school project/ scanning/ copying few documents. It occupies less place and not very huge as compared to other printers.",4
"Bought this close to 10k rupees. Overall it’s for home purpose only. Print quality is good.
I went to high price just for duplex printing.

Con:
Scanner is just ok. I say it has bad scanning capability. 300ppi scanning is good. 600ppi takes 40 seconds. For 1200 ppi one must die and take rebirth to see it.
Don’t thing scanning is fast like what we see at xerox shop",3
"Installation was smooth and didn't take much time to sort things out and make it working. HP smart app is pretty user friendly that way.
4.2* from 328k reviews does say the app is good enough to do what is expected out of it.
My 5 stars is purely on the value for money it carries with wifi and auto duplex features.",5
"Pro's
The size is very sleek
The light indications for various events and errors
The paper tray has a yellow light indicating the tray is not closed
Duplex printing
Good quality photo prints
Easy to Print using phone
Con's
The cost of ink and prints are bit expensive but that a case for any inkjet",5
"Good print quality and easy to print.
The main disadvantage with the printer is its very hard to install/Setup. Got no installation manual with the printer..and the one available online doesn't help.with the wifi set up. Had to do lot of trial and error methods to make the printer work on wifi.
Also no specific set-up videos on
You Tube for this particular model.",4
"The printer is not as user friendly as claimed. Event after following all the prompted actions, it encountered problems while connecting through HP app on IOS. With much effort, the printer finally started but still did not receive print command from mobiles. Had to connect to PC using USB for printing. So much for dual band direct WIFI feature.

Got early delivery. Thanks to Amazon.
Packaging was good and device is very light weight.
Configuration and setup was very easy.
Tested colour, B/W printing - working fine.
Tested photo copying - working fine.

This works fine with USB cable and WiFi on Windows 10 laptop.
Working good from iPhone mobile too.
Thanks to HP and Amazon.",5

"Good product for home and children use. Print quality is fine. Not like laser printing or professional work, but good for students. Color printing is also good. Wireless printing gives a good overall experience and easyness.",5
"First printer worked perfectly. The second printer is defective, the cartridges that came with it were dry, its a month now and even after repeated calls there is no response from the customer support.
I have had excellent experience with hp products but this last product and after sale support is such a disappointment .",1
"Hello everyone,
Just received the printer. Printing, scanning & copying works fine from mobile & PC. To have auto duplex function, please install the correct driver from the HP website. So far the printer works good. Need to check how many pages it prints per cartridges.",4
"It's printing cost is very high.
It Cartridge cost approx INR 800/=each (Black & Tri Colour).
Company wrote that u can print 480 pages from Black Cartridge and 150 pages from tri colour but it's not true. After 200-250 print app will show u very low on ink.
I will not recommend any one to buy this product.",1
"This is a horrible product, doesn’t detect your mobile or any other device it takes hours to print or scan a single page. It is easier to go to a market and get it the print than priting from this useless machine . I would give a 0 out of 5 star to this. Doesn’t work on a 300 mbps connection. Dont buy!",1
"Setup was a bit time consuming. Google cloud print, Airprint setups are a little tricky. Printer works well. It is opted to use WiFi always.",5
Good product. Works flawless as advertised.,5

Excellent printer for home use. Duplex printing with wireless connectivity makes it very much useful for home use.,5
Very bad experience with Amazon. Printer not working properly. H P declared printer D.O.A. ( Dead on arrival) but Amazon not changed printer. Now I will file complaint in consumer court against Amazon.,1

"The printer was delivered before time. The buttons and panel is not great. Limited functionality on printer. HP smart app and another service plugin is useless. The customer care took 2 hours to install the printer and failed. Took 2 visits from service centre to install. Installation is a nightmare. HP customer care is so ridiculous that i couldn't redeem free headset and offer expired. 1st time cartridges are test cartridges and wont give full number of prints. Technician are not trained. Printer is fine but print quality is below average.

I had an offer voucher on flipkart and a discount during republic day hence bought it. Would be throwing it in dustbin if it bothers me. Hard to find good companies or printer these days. All want to rob you of your money with poor chinese quality products and 3rd grade service",1
"This printer is not at all cost effective. It will give black and white print at cost of 4 rs/page
Already printed ~100 pages and ink is 75% gone though product claims 450 pages per cartridge
The word ink advantage is a misnomer

If you need all purpose printer rather than for printing mostly then only this can be considered
Pros- Duplex printing(both side printing automatically) ; copy; scan; wifi
Cons - high per page printing cost",1
"Customers are mislead about the detials of the HP products. Once you buy the product it does not match with the promises they make or told about the product. Customer Service is pathetic. We simply can not get through it. Even if we get connected, what ever the issue is there they simply say that the service is not available. I have brought Deskjev Plus Inkjet Advance 6075. I swear, please do not buy this printer. It is sheer waste of money. The company does not help you instatllation in person. If purachased by techinically challanged people it will be difficult for the them to connect over wifi etc. The pritnting is damn slow. The printing catridge aslo finishes very quickly. Genenuine request to all. Please do not buy.",1
"HP 682 Setup Tri-color Cartridge working for only 35 to 45 pages. Number of papers, Cost wise this printer is worst. Don't buy this.
For Example:
I bought HP 682 Setup Tri-color Cartridge for 796 rupees.
and it's worked for only 41 pages which is worth of 41x5 rupees = 205 rupees.
Simply was wasted 591 rupees + Electricity + Black Ink

Don't buy this worst product if you are expecting 150+ prints for single colour cartridge.",1
"Really it's a very very good printer hp 6075
And the print speed is very good 👍buy it.
The print quality is also good. Iam happy to buy this printer HP DESKJET 6075",5
Worst ever .just 100 pages ink gone .maintainance at high cost.don't buy it.go for Epson or other printers.waste product in hp,1
"- Print quality is good
- Installation procedure provided is easy to follow. Installation is straightforward
- WiFi printing is good
- Not yet printed from mobile device
- Will try photo print next week",4
Printer is good but ink runs out quickly especially Colour Cartridge ink. The print quality is good.,3
"The product is overall good. Pretty decent for someone who has basic home requirements or small business. It does the job. A couple of things to keep in mind:

1. Colour image print takes a lot of time. In some cases, it takes upto 3 minutes to print a page. This is mostly dependent upon the file size of the photo. Bigger the size, higher the time. At certain times the print quality may not be that impressive as you may expect.

2. For setting up the printer, company has not given a user manual. This may get a little difficult for people who are not highly tech friendly, as bringing up the printer on your local LAN maybe some trouble. A printer on LAN helps you print pages with a lot of convenience.

Other than that I found it quite decent!",4
Printing quality is not good as expected. Disappointed.,2
"Writing this based on 7 days use experience.

Pros
1. Wifi Printer, having scanner, copy and Fax at low price.
2. App based use for convenient print, scan, fax.

Cons
1. Colour print quality is just average.
2. Ink provided along with Printer can last only less than 30 color print.
3. Print speed is very slow over wifi. May be 2 paper in a minute
4. Getting connected to wifi for printing is a pain

Personal thoughts- My use is only 20 page print in a week currently and thus can live with this.
Those expecting quality colour print, or high speed printing or print requirement is too much may search for other option, as ink cost will be too high comparing to getting printing outside.

Yet to print photo paper to assess quality.

More review after new ink installation and few months of use.",3
"1,Can be buy for Minimal uses purpose.
2, scanner and printing is slow but reasonable price
3, Worsted connection with wifi,many time disconnected , again it will take more time bro reconnect
4, Print quality good.
5,I purchased only for ADF scanner. That fullfilled.
6, I bought 3 days before (6/11/2020) so i don't know reliability.
7, cartridge - I taken 10 colour print copy but cartridge ink level shows less than 50% . May be i can take another 6-7 copy only.",3
"It doesn't have a scanner. We purchased a wrong product.
It is a total waste of money.",1
"Actually it's a good product. Printing quality is also nice. But there is problem in connection with HP smart app (Mobile version) via ""Wifi Direct"". Actually it's not even a problem it's just a mistake. I had applied for return and ordered another also. No doubt product is really nice. But now I came to know that it was not even a problem. I watched some videos contacted HP but nothing worked out well. Here's the solution:-
1. First connect to a wifi network ( you can also use hotspot).
2. Setup the app. Login to your HP account.
3. Press Wireless and Resume buttons on printer at the same time for 3 seconds. You will see a small printer and mobile icon on the bottom of the screen (means ""Wifi Direct"" is on).
4. Now disconnect you wifi and connect it with your printer.
These steps are for the setup. Next time just directly connect to the printer. You will not be able to use internet while you are connected with the printer.

I haven't tried it yet. But is 100000% correct. Hope this is helpful...

PS: I sold it for Rs 4100, printing cost was so much I gave me around 400 pages for Rs 2000. I tried to refill the cartridge but I didn't worked. Cartridge got condemned. Think before you buy. Good for less use!",5
"The software is very buggy. Even if paired and connected via WiFi, it does not detect the other 5 in on state even if printer is on. When detected and given print command via mobile it takes ages to transfer a single page document to the printer, and then it prints only half the document wasting the paper.. really frustrated with the printer, wasted almost half day for printing a 1 page document yet no luck..

Edit: Updating review to 1 start as even replacement piece was faulty.",1
Can't access the value because no one from Amazon or HP has contacted for installation. Very poor service. A company person came and dumped it at office. No knowledge hot to connect because it's a technical product. It is not a child's play. Also while ordering extended warranty option was missing now it is reflecting. Very confused whom shall I call for the remedy. Either buy in directly from croma or Hp they provide full solution till installment and extended warranty,1
"1. Suitable for small office and home office
2. Scanner is good.
3. WiFi connectivity is not great
4. HP smart is a cloud based app. If you install HP smart half the drivers do not get installed. Reliability is low.
5. HP support was very helpful in getting the application package/drives/installation for this device. (Alternatively you can look for drives/set up for Hp 4100 family series drives/app and install)
6. Post installation of dedicated app and drives, the device is working beautifully.",4
"I am totally disappointed with it so I replaced it bt after the replacement while the verification they made cancelled so the product could not replaced. I lost my money 😭😢😢😢. And product is not working properly, while printing it takes whole papers and printing will be in the corner of paper.",1
"don't waste your money on this, within 10-15 pages your black cartridge will be over, and within 10 pages your color will also over, then after that, you cannot refill your cartridge, directly you have to purchase a new cartridge with cost 1400+ for 2 cartridges, wireless connectivity also not good, also it is very complicated to use, the best thing I can say about this is DONT PURCHASE IT.",1
"This is not working properly taking multisheet at a time, ink drying quickly even in black, setup is taking long time and not easy to understand,
Quality of the priniting also very bad, it will trouble lot to normal printer user,
Service center of hp is very pathetic not even bother about the customer...",1
"HP DeskJet 4123 Multi-Function Inkjet Printer with ADF
There is absolutely no documentation with the printer. The one-page instruction takes you to a website that is not helpful. It took me a while to get it to work on Windows 10. USB connection didn't work. Can't comment on the quality of printing just yet, but looks pretty average.
Do not buy if you don't know what a printer driver is, where to search for it, download and install it. Ideally, such ""home printers"" should have a plug and play installation.",3
"It's works very slowly , I don't like it ...I ordered it but when I connected it via wifi the name of this device is 4100 I don't understand what is happing here, bit confuse this product is real or fake the blue sticker which was their above it's surface in every product in the review. ...But in my product nothing shown like this..I don't no this product is real or not ?",1
"speed of the print & cost per page print is what the major difference for model to model.
At this price range, its decent one.
Best for home usage(max 100-150 prints per month).

Cons:
* Configuring wifi is not simple(especially while using iPhone/Mac). Company can consider giving manual for the same.",5
"Works as expected. I'm totally satisfied with this printer. It's pretty good for home or personal use. And fully loaded features with ease like wireless printing, scan, copy and a 35 page auto document feeder. But it wolud have been better if the catrideges could have printed a few more pages.",5
Wireless printer with app for phone and email id to print from remote location. Other ways also for remote printing. You dont need any cable to print from phone or pc. Cartridge are cheap and print quality also good. Document feeder is a plus thing for hasel free copying or scanning,5
"When it works, its great. But that is exceedingly rare. Paper just keeps getting jammed over and over again. I am honestly trying everything I can to avoid having to get a print out because of the paper jamming issues. Guess it is more environmentally friendly because you will only get a print out when its the only option",3
"When printing, it prints good but the cartridge finishes up fast though not many print outs taken.

Another issue that the printer is not connected wirelessly... It connects on Wi-Fi once, then if I switch it off and on it again, I have to reconfigure it or use cable for printing.",2
No support from HP at all .. the Customer Care number provide in the site is not reachable.(1800-2000-047),1
"Very satisfied with this printer, copier & scanner. Good part is it comes with ADF.
Best multi function printer in this range.",5
The set up is not easy how ever once done especially the Direct WiFI once set up it becomes a good product.,4
Ordered this for my colleague and he loved the WiFi print option. He kept telling me how great the printer works.,5
"The product was delivered as mentioned. Packaging was good. Installation through the hp app and wifi connection was a little time consuming, however not that hard. The prints are good.",5
It's just been a month I bought this product and have us d it just twice and now getting issues with the connection issue printing issue and sometimes gets error as ink over where in ink is also there is cartridge. Really not happy with the product in just a month.,2
"My criteria was once a page print per week or 15 days also it has xerox and wireless connectivity so m happy
U need to call a technical guy for setup do book in advance wd hp its free
Not tried scanning rest all is good",4
Received the product well in time. Good product in this price range. Print quality is average. Driver is not included in this package. This is creating problem linking with PC. Otherwise it is a good deal.,4
Printer was well packed with safety. Configuration of wifi with HP smart App and Wifi-Direct is easy. i button helps in getting information or you can check YouTube videos also to setup. 805 cartridges are available tricolour and black both.,5
"It's a good Printer from HP, But consuming lot of Ink. If you are using very rarely you can prefer this printer and scanner is also Good. WiFi Tech is great and we can print from phone also through the connected router which is Good to use on the go.",4

"Print quality is avarage, colour printing trough WiFi takes a lot of time and ink to complete. I have given 3 colour print and the output is good but after 3 prints colour fades on paper. I will recommend go for HP 2700 Series, and the document feeder is quiet useless because it damaged the corner of the pages.",4
"No of prints per cartridge is very less. Color cartridge exausts very fast. Each prints costs you more than 10Rs.
Technology wise it is good. You can fire prints via wifi. Setup is bit tricky",2
"Printing or xeroxing output not clear...
After 10pages of printing full dots appear ing....
Paper getting stuck inside very often....
Noise coming around while copying...
Totally not compatible and user friendly...",1
"First of all its wifi is not working properly.
Secondly it's colour isn't that much good as per printing quality.
Thirdly it's not cost efficient.
Fourthly It would cost you around 3 INR to print a single page of sheet.
Lastly it's not a good choice for me.",1

An overall awesome printer. It takes care of most of my daily work. Pretty quick too. And colours accuracy is also very good. A must buy product.,5
Very Good Printer for Home and SOHO. Cartridge yield is also good. Highly recommend as compared to other brands. ..,5

Dual Band WiFi & ADF is something that I find really useful. The look of the printer complement to the interior of my house.,5
"A very excellent product and happy to share it’s review for the others who want to buy. It is very useful, efficient and trustworthy product.",5
Print quality very good. Suggesting to all my friends to buy this. Best purchase till date and worth the money.,5
The product is overall good. Pretty decent for someone who has basic home requirements or small business. Print quality is very good...,5
Good printer for working from home. Easily installed. Good print quality. Worth the price. Definitely recommending it for home use.,5

"Excellent Product. Even in draft-mode also, the print quality is excellent. I am quite impressed with ADF (automatic document feeder) feature. Able to scan and preserve the soft copies of many pages very easily. The HP customer support is very good. I recommend this product.",5
Good product.,5
"It was delivered a few hours before the time given. I have just set it up and using the HP app on my phone to print, scan and copy. You can email and send documents on WhatsApp too. HP app is impressive. Responds to commands quickly.
Packing was impressive. Unpacking not time consuming. Setting up through HP app on my iPhone was smooth. All functions work well. Connected it to Alexa and the voice commands works too. The only thing to note is the gap between claim of speed of printing and actual printing time it takes. If you are using it for personal use and are not in a hurry the printer speed will not annoy you. It's slow, very slow. I believe it prints not more than two pages b/w in 60 seconds.",3
"This printer - HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE 2700 ALL IN ONE printer of HP make was purchased on sale, but it ended up with worst product. The paper jam occurs more frequently, the printer was very very very slow, print on both pages option not available, and the top loading paper mode was giving more trouble. The box was not opened for the first 4 days due to Covid pandemic instructions. The courier boys were first source of spreading covid, and to take utmost care, we have not opened the box containing printer for the first 4 to 5 days till it is completely sanitized. After installation we had faced so much of inconvenience in paper loading. The printer is absolutely non-performing, and malfunctioning. You are requested to immediately take back and give refund or give credit for future purchases. I am a prime member and dont disappoint by claiming any excuses. Simply the product (printer) which was purchased on sale was a dump product and is a totally mal-functioning and worst product. Immediate necessary action may be taken at your end.",1
"Well, the hp 2700 delivered initially had problems with the paper feed. The paper was pulled to one side and got crumpled inside. Amazon team was kind to give replacement within 48 hours. The replacement (same model) was tested and is working fine. Quality control needs to be in place either at HP end and before delivery.",3
"Though the print quality is descent, I could only print 6 color and 24 black prints using the cartridge that came with the printer against the claim of 150color n 450 black prints....",2
"If one is decently tech savvy, but without the knowledge of the inner workings of a printer the online demo of how to install a cartridge is not up to mark. Ideally it should have been a 5 minute job to download and set up the printer, but because this model is not listed on HP website it shows demo for other model and the cartridge installation section doesn't mention that you have to pull the cartridge insertion slot from the side where it is usually stuffed. I spent another 10 minutes wondering where the cartridge insertion slot was as per the web demo only to figure out myself it is tucked to one side and needs to be slid to the center to insert the cartridge.",3
"Great service by Amazon surprise to see the delivery boy early in the morning...great
lots of thanks for delivery person for delivery within 24 hrs and nice product received.

But HP service has a big big issue.",2
"Very good quality printer and scanner. Easy to use, especially with the wireless connection. We are using this a lot
for our work as well as for our kids online school assignments. This is especially helpful because we don't want to go to a cybercafe during pandemic.",5
"I initially hesitated to buy this printer reading the reviews,but as it was an emergency I bough it. It got delivered in 2 days, packing was flawless. The wifi setup is easy enough, It took me less than 15minutes to learn everything about it and print from my phone. The print quality is great and it's fast enough, atleast as fast as they claim, 7pages per minute(colour, std quality) ,best quality printing will take longer time and will be taxing for your cartridge, might not need that for most cases. Please ignore other reviews, You can trust me and have a wonderful experience with this printer. Btw I bought it for 5399 ₹, which is excellent value.",5
"This printer is working super duper. No catalogue is available with this product except the one featuring essential basic things. But it takes you to the website from where you can set up the entire matters. I am a layman of 67 years with not much exposure to the nitty gritty of all these but I could manage the entire set up by myself and the printer was in action in less than one hour. Do not regret in purchasing this. I use it at my home ( no commercial need.)
Satisfied. Worth the money spent.At this time of writing this review I do not know how much prints one can have from the first cartridge I got along with it.",5
"Installation was not easy even for the person whose living is earned by working with all such devices. Before he could show me how to print, curfew & lockdown have kept him away. There's no manual in hard copy to help me. Instead of messages from the printer such as ""no paper"" etc there are symbols & they're placed on top, not facing the user. Crippled as I am, not knowing what is showing on top because I'm sitting in front of the desk, not able to ask someone to tell me what symbol is lighted up, & even if they tell me, having no manual to guide me, the printer is unusable at present.
Online videos are focused on wireless use & using via phone. Nothing else seems to matter.
Because I hadn't found another printer that's not designed similarly, & this was all I could afford, I bought it. Now I'm sorry I did.",2
"The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the first three pages that I printed, the ink smudged across the page. That apart, I am well-satisfied with this product. My usage is not heavy but I generally end up printing between 5-10 pages per week, and this is good enough for my purpose. Linked up well with the android phone also. I don't understand why the latest app was not available in the given HP page, but as soon as I installed the printer app, it blanked out my phone and asked me to install the ""new"" plugin. I mean, where's the point of having two different plugins for the same purpose. Would have been much better to update the main app, rather than force the users to install multiple plugins.",4
"In the past I have used printers of various brands as I do a lot of printing and scanning work. My two year old printer is an Epson ink tank. This is the first time I am using a wireless printer and I am satisfied with the ease of printing and scanning. No more wires required, just connect to the printer wifi and print. The set up was a bit confusing because they have not mentioned much on the printer's manual. The printer's wifi password is also not there on the manual, you will have to print the password from the printer itself. It's a combination of digits. I still have not figured out how to use my home's wifi to print using this printer. There are two ways I use this printer:
1. By connecting usb cable from device to printer. This is wired printing.
2. By connecting to the printer's inbuilt wifi from any device. This is wireless printing.
The third way to print is using your home's wifi which I am not interested. The built quality of the printer is good. However, the color in the cartridge gets used up really quick. I bought this to get print quicky and wirelessly. I still have my Epson ink tank printer for heavy printing. All in all this is a good wireless printer in it's price range.",5
"The printer, scanner and copier, all the functions work very smoothly. You need to give it some time after proper setup so that you can get the best possible speed of printing.
Don't fall for negative reviews. People don't understand how the things work in these printers, hence they assume that it doesn't work properly and give negative reviews. Yes, some of them might be genuine issues but I'm sure that not all of them are problematic.
If you find problem in detection of page (wrong page size shown) then it is just because of that blue stopper marker, slide and fit it to the tightness, with the page width, I assure you the wrong page size problem will no longer be the problem anymore.
Use it wisely to get the longest lifespan and also protect ot from dust to achieve the same...
Thank you...",5
"This is my second printer from HP. First one was 377x series and a best one. Got it for less than 5k. But had a manual hardware damage then I bought this one. Both are pure personal purpose. Highly overpriced with Less capabilities and a complicated one to use!! Very disappointing and regret now. Instaed of this headache , might by one more - but I doubt if it's from hp this time ...",1
Easy to setup and was delivered next day. Additional black cartridge promised as part of the order was missing.. overall decent for home use.,4
". HP support videos are useful to setup the printer with cartridge etc.
printer is easy to setup using hpsmart app on phone. Also once it's setup can be easily accessed from laptop,ipad when all are connected to same wifi.
As of now cannot comment on cost of each print..since our usage is very low and just bought it 2 days ago.",5
This product is not user friendly specially through Wifi and mobile Hp app. When the product is purchased online the company or dealer should arrange for installation of the product through their engineer /staff. We are suffering a lot in the absence of this facility. It has become regular practice not to care for after sale service or follow up personally with customer by email or phone through their idle staff just to ask whether the product is working in good condition? and to the expectation? My product is not working till date. Although the cartridges are costly we must get the output as assured by the company. Since last 10 years I am using Hp printer but this time I am totally upset specially in current pandemic situation.,1
"Agree with another reviewer. The quality is questionable.
The first printer I got had a defective paper feeder. The ink receptacle also had problems. After every print job E would flash on the printer display. HP support was useless.
Fortunately, Amazon agreed to replace (no refund).
The second printer set up and works fine.",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Quality 10/10
Weight - light
Speed per page - color print slow, black print good.
Overall best printer for home usage (300 pages per month) best use.
Wifi dual band, easy installation, HP Android application, Alexa, Google Assistant, LCD display Print, Scan, Copy . All in one best printer.",5
"I have ordered yesterday evening and recieved it today.
User manual doesn't have much details but got installation demo video on YouTube for 2700 series which helps to get printer installed.
Installation is very easy. As of now, printed few b&w and colour pages and happy with the quality of printing.
Will write another review after using it for some more days.",4
I recently purchased HP printer 2788. It has printing issues as it prints only on fourth corner of page while rest remains blank. I called customer care of HP they informed about motherboard issue which is manufacturing defect. I asked them to replace the printer but they didn't agreed and said that someone will visit to fix it or I go myself to center to get it done. This is a really bad approach. My printer is under warranty thereby needs replacement on manufacturing defect. I am requesting Amazon as a seller to help with this and get the warranteed product replaced.,2
"Not detecting A4 size paper, no option to connect to agent on customer care, service centre in gurgaon does not have any provision of complaint registration, they don't know email id for complaint registration and very rude behavior by Ms. Babli who attended my call. She doesn't know anything on how to provide support if customer is facing any issue.",1
HP printer 2778 is great for wireless printing and features for wireless connectivity. Initially i had problems with slow printing issues abot 3.5 mins/page but calling up the HP customer care solved my issues on slow priting. Rest all is fine with this printer.,4
"Both HP & Amzon fooling customer. I started facing issue in product within 1 month of purchase but brand is not able to provide proper warranty services, they dont have any service center nearby my location & asking to visit 200kms away service center which is truly impossible for anyone. When approached Amazon for help, they too not able to help due to policy concerns. In short complete waste of money.",1
"After printing, almost 150 black cartridges are empty and colour after 20 pages (A4). The product description was around a rupee and few paise for black and 2 rupees for colour print. Nut in my experience, it is 5.30 rupee for black and white and 40 rupees for colour printer.

A complete waste of money

Print quality was good, but the installation process was a little time-consuming (registration in the hp smart app and time taken to detect and register the printer).",1
the printer keeps getting stuck as there is some glitch with windows 10. works fine with my pc's running older versions of windows. Just wont work well with pc's running on windows 10.Setting up the printer is simple and fast . just when printing there is a problem onec the first print job is given then you have to manually reset the print spooler service after every job .,3
"Very bad, it doesn't even get connected, worst product and worst support from Amazon as well as hp I have experienced so far",1
"First Printer is made in China. It's language also comes in Chinese. Wifi connectivity is very poor, every time while you give print first pair your device it's taking to much time . In box showing Model No. 2770 but in software it's showing 2700 series, and printer also showing in Wifi 2700.",2
"First time I received the printer was not even starting. Though it was brand new condition.
I ordered replacement and had issues with print quality with stripes and mirror imaging of pictures. Bit shocked with hp quality and unnecessary taking all the troubles. May be I was having bad luck",3
"Product does it job but overpriced during sale. Just a false hype created to sell this model.
Also paper feeder seems defective getting paper size errors.",1
"Not so easy to install but manageable despite the lack of instructions for this model. Wireless works great but since my WiFi password changed I have been using with wire as am too lazy to figure out how to reinstall it. Print quality is great and I don’t use colour just black and white draft prints which give me 350-400 pages from new cartridge. I am happy with that. The ones that come with the printer are for test only and lasted less than 30 prints for me but the cartridge is pretty affordable so I am very happy with this buy. Would recommend as it’s lightweight, easy to use and prints regular pages pretty fast (not colour).",5
"The specifications stated that the printer is compatible to windows 10 and 7 along with some other os. But the printer hp2778 which was supplied to me was not compatible to windows 7 and compatible to windows 10 only. Although at the time of ordering I got it clarified also. Moreover on the package carton also mentioned compatible to windows 10,7. Due to this non conformity I had plenty of trouble in installing the printer. Ultimately I have to get set with a laptop having windows 10 as os hence incurring additional costs and inconvenience.",3
"For home use it is very good printer. With Wifi feature I can shift my printer to any place in my home. I took photo prinout on A4 photo paper and print was very good, but it took lot of colour ink. Overall satisfied with the printer.",5
"This printer is not working properly. Not able to connect to wifi or laptop. Not able to print documents from my laptop. I want to replace it, if possible.",1
The product didn’t work after installation - had to call hp engineer who said that the PCB is not working and they Would repair it instead of replacing the printer,1
"Very good product.Printer is light weight, easy to install n set up. Print quality very good. Got 2 cartridges with it. Compact.
Highly recommended 👍",5
"IF I COULD GIVE LESS THAN 1 STAR I WOULD.
THE PRINTER IS CONSTANTLY THROWING PAPER MISMATCH ERROR. TRIED DIFFERENT SETTINGS BUT TO NO AVAIL. COPY SIZE GETS RESIZED AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN SETTINGS.
I AM FED UP OF THE PRODUCT.",1
"First paper will not get straight,it has lot of error,ink get half exhausted after 4 th colour print. I didn't like the product ..
Not a value for money..",2
Very compact lightweight printer. Wifi is working nicely. Installing HP smart in Laptop is a little tricky but at the end it's working fine.,5
"Vary wrost product, waste of money, cartridge ink finished within 15 days and unable to refill it, refilled but not getting actual colour. Very bad product. Not expected such thirdclass quality for HP",4
"The print quality is so poor and initially the printer doesn’t work well.
I asked for a replacement/ or return and they said it won’t be possible.
I suggest don’t buy printer from this seller.",1
"Wrost thing done in my experience with amazon when i buy this printer it did not work then i send a requested to replace it but they didnot give any reply
Not excepting this from amazon!",1
The paper feed is damaged and not functiining properly. Return window closed as late by 10 minutes. What a bad luck.,1
Good printer.Wireless is very comfortable.Print quality is fine. Setting up wifi printing is a quite tedious task as the software provided are not user friendly . Apart from that Printer is value for money.,5
"everytime i try to scan something its come out like that like really distorted, I hope for replacement lets see
EDIT :- I got my my replacement and its working fine thanks to amazon",3
"Don't buy this

This printer might cost you less but cartridges are too costly.
Buying cartridges are like paying EMI for a costly printer.
So better buy ink tank printers, b'coz it doesn't have cartridges and ink is less expensive compared to hp 682 ink cartridges.",1
Smart looking convenient printer giving proper printouts and scans so far. However the setup is a very complicated issue. You will need proper engineers to align softwares with your PC and get it working,4
"The ink in set of cartridges did only
ten pages printing and the color one
only printed 5 pages. This was not expected from HP which big company
and has large reputation. Company should replace these cartridges free.",2
This is third class printer. I bought for office work. It is not connected mobile wi-fi and only 20 print black and white in new cartiage. It is printing rate per page 20rs above.So I suggest it is not like for office work.,1

This product not good.I want to return the Product.Description wrong mentioned.I am getting only less than 20 prints for color catridge and less than 100 for black catridge.,1
It printer is available at hp store at Rs 6199. It will be better if you buy printer from HP store.,1
"Basically under 7k all printer are same ,only differentiation is wifi ,using high yield inks ,auto duplex and lcd.

This printer have wifi,uses high yield inks and lcd for quick copy function (you can see how many copies are printing) only thing it does not have autoduplex function..I don't use duplex so it doesn't matter much for me.

If you are really looking for auto duplex than canon have couple of printers in 6.9k - 8k range with all function what hp have..hope it helps",5
"Disappointed with the speed ofPrint...
Reminds me of 20 year old printers taking more than 2 minutes to print single page.
Use of Draft setting was slightly fast but still not very good.

Installing was a again a lengthy procedure,
Even after installation running installation second time though the printer has started printer,may be updated exe file.

Wants you to use Microsoft Store instead of normal programs.",1
