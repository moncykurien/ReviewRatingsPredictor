good quality.Product is of good quality and can be used at home.Recommend the product.,5
Good I like it.Good one no issues,4
"Very good experience till now! (4.5 stars).Read my 4 star rating as 4.5...It's been a few months since I bought this...I compared with other models of Omron for features and price before finalizing (as I was a first time buyer of a nebulizer)

Pros - useful for everyone in the house these days (as pollution related problems are on the rise), my little one sleeps with comfort after nebulising; very convenient, safe and inexpensive compared with conventional forms of administering medicine...This particular machine combines very good features with very good price. Very good features include a mask for little ones, high nebulisation rate (2ml gets done in ~7-10 mins), spare air filters, ease of cleaning and a bag for carrying the whole pack anywhere with you.

Cons - No real cons, just that the same medicine can be administered even faster (in 30-45 secs.) using the latest puffs that doctors have now started recommending, so consider those also if you have young kids who need the medicines.",4

Thanks to the seller and flipkart.i got it in INR 8099/-.",5
"The monitor was affordable and got it at discounted price(10% discount on credit card),good for a 24 inch monitor to use for work as well as watch Videos on youtube,OTT platforms.It has only HDMI output so users having VGA,DVI,DP have to use an adapter,but considering that all tje laptops and desktop mother boards come with HDMI port,should not be an issue.",4
"This is the good one which I have choose from many other in the market.
1. Color quality is pretty good. And its good also who is working with colors.
2. 24"" size is perfect for coding.

Lack:
1. Refresh Rate: If this is more then better for this monitor, Why because when you watch the movies/ videos you can clearly see the frame response.

"A must have for people who work on coding or your office work. You can have the screen tilted in any direction you like. You can get other monitors for cheaper price but make sure you get a stand like this.

The downside the cables which comes along with it are of no use. You won't be able to make it work with you laptop. I have a z book which has almost all the connectors available but the cables which comes along with this monitor doesn't work at all.",4

"Really good quality product. But remember, you have to Calibrate it at the beginning, which is pretty easy too! Awesome build quality. Colour, Saturation & Sharpness is just the perfect!

Important Note: If connected over HDMI, change the default 'RGB' mode to 'YCbCr' to achieve an accurate blackness of the screen, resulting in to perfect Saturation.",5
Nice Product. Suitable for work from home. It does not have HDMI Cable in the package. We need to buy it as a separate one. But overall nice monitor for Work From Home with good budget,4
"Awesome got only rs.11609
One of the best For coding work.",4
one of the best mountain this price range,5
"Monitor is awesome looks great. Pendrive option on side of monitor.
For purchasing monitor before identify graphics card compatible with monitor cables.
Pros:display port cable, USB to blue color like LAN port cable
Cons: lack of HDMI cable, VGA cable",5
Very impressive,5
super..... i am work in Adobe Photoshop...,5
The monitor is aesthetically very pleasing with minimum bezzel around the sides except the bottom. The display quality is very good and the colours are fairly accurate. The monitor can be tilted as per liking and has a sturdy base. The monitor is best suited for office and home use with general computing works. It has speakers but they are very tiny and not useful but it has audio output for attaching external speakers.,5
"BenQ 22inch panel monitor looks and work great, easy to assemble. Packaged in very protective manner, deliver was good. Much satisfied with this purchase.
Down side: Volume is considerable low. Power input cord is large 3 pin which generally seen with A/C, refrigerators and washing machines. Its uncommon in household we have many of such sockets at right spot.",4
"It's been a month, i m using the monitor, its working very well, the IPS panel is really nice, viewing angles, colour, sharpness everything is good. Reading, browsing, watching YouTube videos can be done smoothly. Speaker volume is too low but i don't really need them.
What i didn't like about the monitor is that it takes almost 5 seconds to turn on.
Other than that its amazing so i'm rating 5 starts wanted to rate 4.75 but there's no option, so 5 it is.",5
"Superb quality and works fine as expected. Inbuilt sound is bit poor as it was designed to the one who sit just infront of the monitor.

Overall as remaining reviewers said it is a great product.",5
Good Colors. Value For Money Product.,5
fabulous product,5
"After using for one day, I can say this monitor is fine but you have purchase a 6 Amp power cable seperately around Rs120, because the power pable provided with the is of 16Amp which does not fit the switch board.",4
Good,4
Nowhere in the description or on the box it mentions that 16A sized 3pin cable is included with monitor. That size is used for Fridge/Microwave etc and doesn't fit in a regular 3 pin socket. Can not use this monitor without buying a convertor now. Highly disappointing that this is not mentioned in any of the product details.,5
"Quality is good viewing angles are also good IPS panel display but the sound output is very less, lesser than the mobile phone, inbuilt speakers are useless,One VGA input and one HDMI , also the auto matic brighness feature also working well comparing the price with other available in the market the product is very good.",5
"A perfect monitor for content creators and students and IT employees. It's been 3 months now working great for me, and you can customize the view angle and adjust for eye vision. Thanks flipkart and local delivery person Mr.Meganathan for the speedy and secure delivery!!!",5
"Review after 7 days !!!

Wonderful screen. Picture quality is awesome. Design is very nice. You need to set according to your choice in case you need for better feeling. I have changed the brightness and contrast accordingly. It have eye care technology which will have low blue light emission but I changed to manually to my choice. It's perfect for coding and other activities. You will be feeling good after working on this screen due to size and quality.

Light sensor works perfectly fine. Still you can choose to enable it or not.
Overall it's very good the price you pay. Not sure about gaming but it's not for higher games that need higher refresh rate.

I got it arround 9k during offer. Packaging is very good.

Thanks flipkart for good and safe delivery.",5
"Let's start with real world performance. The monitor looks chic and the slim bezels wows. The brightness is adequate and colours pop decently. The image is pretty sharp too. Now coming to the more technical side, the monitor can be easily over clocked to 75Hz for a smoother gaming experience. I got the monitor for Rs 7700 in sale and at this price it's a steal!!",4
"Giving review after 10 days. I am satisfied with this monitor. If you are looking for office work then its great choice. I bought this after reading review. Eye care technology is good. Whenever you go near the monitor sensor detects motion and will adjust brightness. There is sensor attached below monitor that manage the brightness as per your body distance.

Speaker is not good and to be honest you cant expect good speaker in this price range. After all i know you are going to attach external speaker so its not an issue.
One more thing just check your retailer is retailnet. Krunal computer is not good. I bought from krunal computer retailer and product not reached even after 16 days. Retailnet delivered in just 3 days. Also retailnet price is lower than Krunal computer retailer.",5
"Monitor is well built and IPS panel is good enough for multimedia consumption and development purposes.

Pros:
1. BI sensor works really great. It adjusts the colour temperatures automatically based on room brightness.
2. Auto turn off feature works just as advertised. It Saves power consumption when it is sitting idle.
3. Quality HDMI cable is given in the box.
4. Out of the box settings are sufficient enough to use it without any extra efforts.

Cons:
1. Monitor wake up time is too much if it goes to sleep for very long time.
2. Two 1 watt speakers are of not useful... except for system sounds.

Overall experience is good so far.",5

Nice and Amazing Product the best part is it got delivered the very next day. It is working very well till now and i am very happy with the product.,5
Was looking for options in more popular brands and a local retailer suggested that BenQ is worthy one. Multiple input/output options makes it very convenient. Upto the expectation. Eye care technology is of great value.,5
"I just received this product, product is good.
Package contains - HDMI wire, Power Cord, Stand Base, Stand Top, Led Monitor.

I setup-ed this product in just 5-10 min. without using any screwdriver.
As i saw many videos and reviews regarding its problem like screen bleeding, but i did not found any kind of issue. its my first day and review adding after usage of 2 hours.

"Good, fast delivery.

Good monitor for office work and 1080p gaming. Amd free sync ability helps go 75Hz without vsync. Colors could be better, though. And the dynamic contrast ratio is more pain than pleasure.

Bezels are not as narrow as it seems. The rim is definitely narrow and the glass big, but when on you will notice gaps around the screen on the edges, under glass.

No bundled driver. Default drivers work fine but if you want a bit more functionality use the online driver/controller app.",5
"Quality in picture is so good that I feel movie.

Good monitor at the this price.. bought it at Rs6599,5
"1 Own 3 of these and I must say.....Benq is best at display...Really gives you paperlike feeling at reading mode. Reading text was never so better..On the other hand, the IPS panel of this gives you incredible display with decent black levels that we are used to.
If you buy these you will feel style dropping off from these.Its beautiful ;)...Loving it.
PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS AUSTRALIAN IMPORT SO NO INDIAN POWER CABLE..........................",5
"The monitor was worth an investment. The display is nice and the screen area cover is good too. I am yet to discover all the display features but the options of brightness to be set for reading, net surfing, etc is a good one. To customize brightness, etc is something which I don't see as of now.",4
Good product with good price . I recommend to buy it. I love it becoz of its picture quality and style.,5
best in its class. wonderful colours and stunning display. perfect for editing photos and gaming. good movie experience as well.,5
"Excellent quality. Very thin bezel with matte finish screen. Viewing angle is amazing and there is no light reflection on screen. Good design as well, since it got small dedicated cable line to hide it on back of the monitor. Great texture design on back of monitor as well for aesthetic appearance. 100% satisfied. Go for it!",5
I purchased this product. this product meets my expectation. It's design is elegant. It supports for eye care mode which is good. Overall product is satisfactory to me. the build is good and minimalist,5

"Good prodcut for this price, can have a wide 27 inch view and good for your second monitor.
Only problem which I feel to buy this as a first monitor for your PC is the resolution is not enough for the display size.",5
"good product , sound need to be improved , sound is given by company but not useful. but all other things are vary good , i love this product in this range
it is actually lcd moniter with led backlight, when black. colour comes on screen it looks too darker like almoded display",4
Nice on price worth! but not good for long view / side view I have purchased it for the purpose of a TV in my room. Sound quality is low less bass and volume over all loved it!,4
The product was great I am loving it and it's working properly and nice packaging nice monitor,5
Happy With the quick delivery of flipkart. But the actual resolution of the monitor is 1366 x 768 not 1600 x 900 as written on the description.so beware of that. And the other thing. I only got this product today so I can't say more about this monitor. But I can say one thing for sure this monitor is pretty much satisfactory for its cost. Maybe I will re-edit this review after using this product for some days.,4
"I am little bit angry. This is LCD Monitor not HD + LED described by your heading line.

Speaker have no sound.

Lastly I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è ... because LCD 19.5 inch good and fit with the price.

Amazing work good quality display mind-blowing super fast delivery,5

I am not satisfied with built in speaker and display type is LCD not led but though it's good product in this price segment .,4
"Although the monitor is great, and very vibrant, I would like to suggest the seller to change the product detail as this monitor only support vga and hdmi input and not dvi as shown in pictures, and another thing, the mac resolution is 1344 x 728 and not 1600 x 900 as mentioned on the details page. Other than that, it's a very good monitor with a little wider fov.",5

Beautiful and crisp picture quality. Connect with the HDMI cable (not included in the box)and see the enhanced picture. Worth the price and a very good deal by flipkart!

"LG 22MP68VQ.
This monitor very good .
My personal experience .
Videos performs good quality .
And this morning looking good.
I have not gaming experience share.
Because, My lower PC , I have not trying to games and HDMI port.
So, I think, this is a best budget monitor.
Sorry, My English is not good. Please try to adjustment.
That's all.",5
Perfect Monitor cum TV for me. Full HD clarity display. I am fully satisfied after buying such affordable Full HD LED Monitor. Actually I have connected Airtel Digital TV and enjoying awesome video experience.,5
"This is my first ever 1080p IPS monitor. The display is really nice and the colors are all really vibrant. It supports freesync and upto 75Hz refresh rate. Out of the box it's at 60Hz unless you turn on freesync. You can unlock the 75Hz even on Nvidia graphics cards, except it won't support the AMD freesync technology. You get an HDMI cable out of the box too, even though I didn't see it being mentioned in the product page.
Please do note that you can't enter BIOS while having the freesync option on. You'll have to turn it off.

The bezels are all thin and it looks really good. Menu navigation is simple and easy to use. LG has their own OnScreenDisplay software that lets you change brightness, contrast and other nifty features. These drivers are on the CD you're provided with. You may also download them from their site, if you're like me and don't have an optical disk drive!",5
"Fabulous Purchase
I am Writing this review after 10 Days of Purchase!!!
And Believe it or not
I don't think presently under 10000 price segment any other monitor can c compete with this. This monitor is absolutely awesome. IPS LED bezel-less display 5 millisecond response time, cable manager, with great viewing angles, awesome colours.
If You are looking for a budget big screen monitor so you can choose it without any doubt.
I have purchased many monitors import segments higher prices and lower prices. And as my experience I think it's best budget monitor.

Happy With the Purchase. Thanks To Flipkart.",5
"22MP68VQ and 22MK600M both have same specification except 3 spec

1. 22MP68VQ IS 2016 MODEL BUT 22MK600M IS 2018 MODEL and the Manufacturing date may vary in both the models
2. 22MP68VQ has VGA, DVI, HDMI and audio out ports - 22MK600M has VGA, 2 HDMI and audio out ports

3. MOST IMPORTANT IS DISPLAY (Panel Bit depth)
22MP68VQ is 8 bits panel and 22MK600M is 8 bits (6 bits + FRC) which is low quality and low cost display than 8 Bits panel.
6 Bits + FRC panel is a 6 bits panel and it try to show image like 8 bits panel using FRC

If you need a crisp and clear display blindly go for 22MP68VQ",5
"Writing this review after using it for 2months it is best in its price segment just go for it.. Dont think too much just buy it I'm saying this cuz I've searched for around 1 month or so. Then i finally made my mind to buy this monitor. If it helps, press like button so that others can also read my comment.",5

8. Brand new item

"I brought this monitor for 7200rs with bank offer.
Excellent monitor for the price tag.
It comes with AMD freesync.
I haven't tested this monitor with games, but perfect for browsing and video or movie.
Pros:
1. Thin bezels for 3 sides.
2. 3 connectors HDMI, DVI,VGA
3. 75 Hz refresh rate regardless of your gpu, just turn on freesync from monitor setting.
4. Black stabilizer works perfectly well.
5. Sharper image and video quality due to higher Pixel density when compared to 24 inch.
6. HDMI cable is available in the package.The cable quality is good.
7. Accurate colours and factory calibrated.
Cons:
1. Glossy finish attract lot of fingerprints( I don't have problem with that) .
2. Backlight bleeding at left corner (IPS panel problem not monitor's problem). It's noticable in darker scene, not irritating though.But while browsing or video playback it's not at all noticable.

Overall pretty good deal for the price range.",5
"Best monitor .but you have to lower down the brightness otherwise it will effect your eyes.
Delivery was fast but the packing was worst no protection was given just came in a tight cardboard box nothing else not even a bubble wrap . And if anyone reading this review knows how to run the monitor in 75 hz please reply because even after turning off the freesync there is no option to switch from 60hz to 75hz ...This monitor can only achive upto 73hz with overclocking but it can decrease the longevity of the monitor so I didn't. So if anyone know the solution please let me know .",5

Good Product. Prompt delivery. cheaper compared to other leading companies. I was surprised to find the power cable with 16 amps plug.,3
"The device is really nice and stand is sturdy as well.
Will totally recommend this for a multiple monitor setup since the bezels are really thin.",5
Good for office work. But there is one problem. Its panel is a cheap one and emits high radiation which is not good for eyes or body at all. I recommend a reputed brand like Dell or Samsung or any good brand if you love your eyes. Or buy a cheap panel like this one and pay your medical bills later. I returned the product.,3
"Great display, accurate colours at this price range",5

If you are looking for a big screen at a low price and ready to compromise a little on text quality go for it.",4
After all the research I found this product to be best and pocket friendly in the segment. I bought this for 9899/-. The screen quality is awesome. If you are searching for great picture quality in budget this product is for you.,5

"It serves the purpose and it is beautiful. Let‚Äôs start the review with delivery. It was fast but the package box was a huge square shaped one with package inside. When I opened it and found the screen is beautiful and sleek. The packaging contained:-
1)vga cable
2) HDMI cable
3) stand for screen
4) screen
5) power cable
6) CD (I don‚Äôt know why I could not find CD drives on most of the latest laptops)
So, it was easy to setup and I was able to do it in less than 5 mins. So here are some pros and cons:-
Pros:-
1) it‚Äôs sleek and take very less space
2) it‚Äôs light and easy to carry(high chances of being delicate)
3) it looks beautiful
4) the orientation like angle and all can be changed
5) it has all the cable and things. No need to buy some other accessories
6) viewing angles are good considering I am going to use it mainly for my work.
Cons:-
1) no height adjustment. For me it was at perfect height. So no complaints
2) not sturdy enough. But I don‚Äôt have to wrestle with it.
So, all in all a good monitor which serves the purpose and it‚Äôs beautiful and sleek",5
"Before describing the monitor itself, I want to mention that I am extremely pleased by the seller and delivery. I ordered this on Saturday afternoon and I had it with me on Sunday afternoon. Fastest delivery that I've ever had.

The box comes with a HDMI and a VGA cable. The screen has a very basic I/O: Just one for VGA and HDMI each. No speakers on the monitor. The monitor stand is fixed, cannot be adjusted for height or swivel. That said, it looks very nice on my desk. The screen is very slim.

I am pleased with the monitor. The display is sharp and colors feel natural with deep blacks. This is what I payed my money for. Might get one more monitor in the future.",5
"Perfect aspect ratio , colours are good . Slim and sleek design . Best in this price range .",5
"Not five star because the response time is not suitable for gaming purposes therefore it is a general purpose monitor. Hope this helps. Brightness is good, and its a good one at this price specially impressed by the 3 year guarantee claim made by the dealer.",4
Got this beauty at just 9300. A pretty good deal for a 24inch IPS monitor. Great color production and the looks pretty slick.,5
"Awesome product. Nice display. Gives some flickering in screen if connected via VGA but crystal clear clarity if connected via HDMI.
Worth buying and value for money.",5
"I've been using it since a year and here is my conclusion...
the display is very good colours are accurate and the resolution is really full hd and it gives full screen experience, just the bezel at the bottom is a bit annoying. there are some difference in colours of monitor and smartphone or other device but I noticed it in every monitor. all and all it's a good product, you should try it out.",5

"It's a good product (only been 1 week though, will update later on).
Looks good.
Works well.
Sleek, light weight.

Following are some nit-picking from the initial experience:
Not easily accessible ports (These are behind screen; hidden).It could have been way better if these would have been on the side.
The stand is good looking, but not practical. It's not height adjustable.",4
"Amazing quality.
Speakers are just awesome. Best speakers on any monitor.
Display better than LG ones.
Eyecare is best while working in dark lighting.

Go for it.",5

"* Amazing clarity
* Crisp Display
* Speakers are good enough for a small room

Worth every penny",5
Monitor is just okay nothing fancy audio quality could have been better,5
"Great product! Overall great monitor for work or general use.

Design and ergonomics:
Premium design and finish. Looks very classy. It's not the slimmest monitor out there but it's uniformly slim rather than being very bulky at the bottom like HP ultra slim monitors. The stand is strong, very stable and metallic. The stand is a bit heavy since it's metallic but the monitor itself without the stand is very light ~2.5kg. The whole body, including the stand and the front chin, has a matte finish unlike most monitors, which gives it a premium look. Plus, great pairing with ThinkPad laptops!

Performance:
Picture quality is great, no bleeding. It does require some fine tuning of brightness and contrast levels based on surrounding light but that'll be required for most monitors.

Other features:
There are preset eye care options for low blue light, reading/text, video and web which are very handy when switching between work and entertainment. It also has a grey coloured cable management hook which can be useful.",5

Trusting LG and Amazon I ordered it on the day of launch only to be disappointed by the poor build quality(See images)
Uneven panel gaps
Unreasonably high screen(IPS) bleeding

One of the other reasons I opted for this monitor was the support of a feature called Dual Controller where one can control 2 machines with one set of keyboard and mouse basically magic! Sadly found out that a necessary part of using this feature called Picture by picture is not supported rendering the 'Dual controller' useless. Also dosent work with VPN connection which many of us need on work PCs",2
"I bought this monitor a while back and here's my experience:

The Good:
1) Has IPS panel thus has excellent viewing angles.
2) Anti glare coating
3) Height , tilt and z-axis rotation
4) Plenty of pre-configured picture modes
5) Gaming mode with black stabilizer
6) Multiple inputs
7) Easy to use joystick control

The bad:
1) No y axis rotation.
2) HDR is not that great, still looks premature and may wash out the colours a bit.
3) No build in speakers.
4) Very heavy",5
"Iam quite happy with the performance of the monitor. LG 27UK650 4k IPS.

I had bought a benq 32"" 4k VA monitor at 39k, but returned it due to poor performance. There was also a grey display bleed on it. The colour reproduction on it was not accurate, especially red. It was also too big for my eyes and got strain after using it. Remember that Pixel density matters and viewing distance. Decide for yourself on that.

LG monitor with IPS panel is much better. Iam using it with macbookpro 15"" and didn't go for LG 27UK850 (43k price) as the only benefit in that is a usb-c port (and additional usb 3.0 ports often unused) with reverse charging. But if you use a single usb-c to HDMI port (good quality with 60hz at 3k price) it also works in the same way but no charging happens. And it is always good to use the original company charger for laptop for longer battery life than using low 60watts of reverse power in the case of LGUK850. Hence LGUK650 (33k price) was apt for me as I use an additional 2.1 speakers (better than ibuilt speakers), taking audio out from the monitor. The menu and the joystick is very intuitive and also easy for volume control. I also noted that audio switching in usb-c to usb-c sometimes doesn't work automatically (in benq) in utube.

Colour reproduction in this LGUK650 is superb and is at par with my macbookpro. Good contrast ratio. Sleek design and white back makes it even stunning especially for my led light bounced on the wall. Stand is also sturdy as I use a height adjustable table. I haven't figured out how to run the mac in clamshell mode without connecting power cable to laptop. Probably it doesn't work.

Go for LGUK850 only if you really need usb-c at that price point.",5
"Received the monitor today and I'm very impressed with the bright display and crisp colors, the text is sharp and clear, the color calibration is good out of the box.
The build quality is also good.

Unfortunately, I got a defective panel which has severe backlight bleed issue, I could have accepted it if the backlight bleeding was equal from all corners, but it is worst on the right side and affecting the color uniformity, as you can see in the attached white image, it has a red tone on the left side and blue tone on the right side, it is more visible in real.

I'm giving 3 stars due to the mentioned issue and going to request a replacement, I'll update the review and give 5 stars if I get a good panel.
If I get a defective panel again, I'll reduce it to 1 star.

*Update after replacement-

I have received the replacement, and surprisingly it has the same problem! I can accept the backlight bleed or IPS glow, but can't accept severe color variation on the screen, you can see the color variation in the attached image, color tones on the right side and left side are totally different, is this acceptable? Going to return it and I won't purchase any monitor from Amazon from now on.",1
Looking at the specs I ordered without any second thought. The first monitor had huge IPS glow. Thinking a defective piece requested for replacement. The second one had IPS glow and huge backlight bleeding. The stand material looks so cheap. I did not expect this from LG. I think they are selling defective products via Amazon.,1
"I've bought this for my Xbox One X.
If you have premium console like Xbox one X and Ps4 Pro then go for it. For PC gaming 4K resolution is too much even for my GTX 970 card. If you want to buy this monitor other than gaming, its not true HDR even it
supports HDR10. Don't use HDR Effect feature for SDR content it looks ridiculous.

After one year of usage corners are turning to red after watching for 3 hours then back to normal only after turning it off for 1 hour.",3
"Let me start by saying this first: This is a good SDR monitor which is decent for HDR usage - It is not great.

I not going to waste time one reviewing the trivial stuff such as ergonomics and style - you can get that from anywhere on the web. I am going to focus on performance and colour reproduction

SDR performance
----------------
This monitor has a really good SDR performance. It has good colour gamut and brightness and decent contrast ratio (1200:1 native). Colour really pop and it comes packed with several colour profiles. In my experience the most accurate - not the most good looking - profile is the SMPTE-C profile. However I switched to the 'Custom' profile and manually adjusted the other parameters like: colour temperature, rgb levels... and got a better result that has delta Es under 0.68.
The panel has pretty good gray uniformity, but the black uniformity is not that impressive; but, it is not a deal breaker, and you have to expect it from any consumer grade IPS panel.

HDR performance
----------------
The monitor does suppoer HDR signals on both HDMI and Display Ports. It is not a true 10 bit panel; it uses 8 bit panel with FRC. This is pretty common now a days while HDR is still in its infancy. The thing is you wouldn't notice much of difference between true 10 bit and 8 bit+FRC for consumer applications. A true 10 bit panel only makes a difference for true professionals such as Colour graders, those in the photography industry, and movie industry who generate HDR content. If you only want consume HDR games and movies 8 bit+FRC should not be a concern; in fact, there are other more important considerations such as: brightness, contrast levels and black levels.

The peak brightness of this monitor is only 450 nits, while HDR specification requires at least 1000 nits. This is where it gets tricky. The HDR specification was originally developed with TVs in mind; they were not meant for PC monitors which sits much closer to your eyes. For PC monitor 1000nits brightness if unnecessary; such brightness levels could damage your eyes. This is why VESA came up with the DisplayHDR specifications that are meant for PC monitors. This new spec has 3 levels DisplayHDR 400, 600 and 1000 - the number indicating the target brightness level. So this monitor KIND OF meets the entry level DisplayHDR 400. I says kind of because while it meets the brightness level requirement, it does not meet other criteria listed in the specification - so this is not a DisplayHDR certified monitor.

Contrast levels should be around 10,000:1 for good HDR performance. This is required for showing details within dark areas; a lower contrast will result in the dark areas being too dark or grayish hiding away the details in them. Sadly, this monitor does not even come close to 10,000:1. The monitor only has 1200:1 contrast ratio. This is expected from IPS panels. VA panels on the other hand offers better contrast ratios and hence better rendering of black and dark scenes - but they suffer from bad viewing angles and does not provide great colour accuracy.

The black levels on this monitor is also not that great. In a dark room, blacks appear dark grey. It is not much of a problem in a moderately lit room. This is due to the lack of local dimming. There are IPS monitors with local dimming, but they are insanely expensive.

So the HDR performance is just decent. The main reasons by it fails to provide a great HDR experience are the lack of local dimming and average constrast ratio.

That being said, let me remind you one thing: HDR on PC monitors is in a messy state. I have not found any monitor that meets all the HDR criteria yet. Some new panels are expected to come out by mid-2020 that could improve this. But at the moment there is no point in wasting a lot of money for better HDR performance as the gains don't justify the price.

Gaming performance
------------------
Very good monitor for gaming; at 5ms the response times are really great for casual and semi-pro gamers. The only serious limitation is the 60Hz max FPS. But then again, running modern games at 4K at even 60Hz would require a beast of a PC; so, I wouldn't worry about that for now.

If you are a professional gamer or mostly play fast paced games like CS, you should look elsewhere; this is not the monitor for you.

Multi-media performance
-----------------------
This is a really great monitor for watching moives and streaming live sports coverage. The colours look really impressive and as long as you are not sitting in a really dark room, the black levels are also decent.

Even though the monitor is limited in its HDR rendering capabilities, it does manage to make a significant difference. I have watched several 4K HDR Hollywood movies and they looked amazing. I have found that sitting in a slightly lit room gives you the best experience with this monitor.

General usage performance
-------------------------
Becasue of the high pixel density of this monitor everything is crisp and clear. You will notice no aliasing with text. In Windows a scaling factor of 150% is required to make texts readable.

Usual Issues with IPS
-------------------------
Backlight bleeding: Backlight bleeding is when the LED backlight steals its way through the panel into the foreground. This usually manifests as a whiter or yellow tint around the edges. Sadly almost every IPS panel has this problem. And the panel I got hs this issues, although not very serious. I can see a tint of yellow in places along the bottom border. This appears to be caused by the bezel pushing a bit too much into the panel; indicating a manufacturing oversight. However this only becomes visible when brightness is increased above 50. However when in HDR mode, the monitor switches to high brightness and this bleed becomes noticeable, especially when the scene is dark. If the content you are viewing - games or movies - is not too dark or black it is not an issues. But when you are watching movie with top and bottom black bars, this yellow tint is a bit annoying.
One thing to remember here is when it comes to IPS there is a thing called panel lottery: no two panels are the same, it will depend of your luck; you may end up with a really good or a bad one or something in the middle.

IPS Glow: This monitor does have IPS glow as does any other IPS panel. Unless you are in really dark room and watching dark content at an angle, this wouldn't be a problem

Check the attached image: The whitish overlay is IPS glow. The yellow tint inside the red circle is Backlight bleed. NOTE: IPS glow and bleed always look exaggerated when photographed. It is not that profound when watched in person.

Usual Questions Regarding HDR:

1. Does this monitor support 4K HDR @ 60Hz over HDMI?
Yes, it does. The HDMI ports on this monitor are HDMI 2.0 and supports HDR meta data. One thing to remember is to enable ULTRA HD Deep Color from the monitor settings for the HDMI port you are using.

2. Does this monitor support 4K HDR @ 60Hz over Display Port?
Again, yes. Now this is something a lot of people seem to be confused about. LG data sheet says that the monitor has DisplayPort v1.2. Now the version 1.2 originally did not have any specification for HDR meta data; this was added only in Display Port 1.4. Now the thing is there are no Display Port 1.2 or Display Port 1.4 devices. These numbers - 1.2, 1.4 - are just versions of Display Port specification document. So a manufacturer could implement a device with a Display Port and implement some features from v1.2 and some from v1.4. This is what LG has done. They have implemented support for HDR metadata into this monitor. So if you connect this monitor to the display port of a source device (Console, PC ...) that also has implemented the HDR metadata support, it will accept 4K HDR signal at 60Hz. At the moment, GTX 10XX and newer cards support this. GTX 9 series does not have support for HDR meta data.

3. How to enable HDR on the monitor?
There is nothing to enable. When the monitor receives and HDR signal, it will automatically switch to HDR mode

4. How to enable HDR on Windows 10?
To use HDR on Windows, you have to first enable it. To do that go to Display Settings - you'll see a toggle there that says 'Play HDR Games and apps'. Just enabled it. Note that this will result in everything else in Windows will look washed out. This is normal and is a known problem when Windows tries to map SDR content to HDR colour space. Unfortunately there is no way around it. Hopefully Microsoft will come up with some solution.

Alternatives:
From my research, there is only one alternative around this price range:
Benq EW3270U - This is a VA panel and provides much deeper blacks and contrast ratio. But it has very limited brightness and viewing angles.

Summary:

A very good monitor for the price asked. Does support HDR at 4K 60Hz. Has common IPS issues like IPS Glow and Backlight bleeding - but nothing too serious. Very good SDR colour gamut. HDR performance is limited due to average contrast and brightness levels. Great viewing angles and pixel density.",4
"Resolution is excellent, I use it as a secondary screen with my retina display MacBook pro and it puts the retina 15"" display to shame.
I also use this as my PS4 Pro monitor and the graphics are crisp and sharp at 60 Hz. Still waiting for games that can deliver true 4k and HDR.

Price is high but compared to buying it in North America and lugging it all the way to India, the price is just right.

Cons: I wish it had two display ports so that I could run both Gaming console and Computer on Display Port.

10/10 in my books",5
"It seems I've got a bad piece. There is backlight leakage from four different areas around the edges (see the attached image). At first, I tried to ignore it, but after watching 3-4 hours of Netflix, I noticed that light leakage was causing significant obfuscation of visuals in the affected areas. I have now requested a replacement and am hoping I'll get a substitute that is free of any defects. Will post an update about it. Other than light leakage, I am overall borderline satisfied with this piece. üòê

**UPDATE (10.10.2019)**
The replacement arrived this morning. And with it, frustration and apprehension. I received a defective piece originally, which got replaced by an even more defective piece üò° ü§¨. My mind just cannot grasp how it is possible for LG's Quality Control engineers to miss such defects during the testing phase, unless of course they deliberately ignored these faults. Please take a look at the attached images. The one marked ""Monitor No. 2"" is what I received in replacement. Even a 5-year old can take one look and tell that something's not right with the panel.

I wonder if these big MNCs have completely abandoned all Quality Control checks from their operations. And it's not just me complaining; take a look at other monitor reviews on the internet, of not just this brand and model, but others too. Thousands of independent evaluators and users are reporting issues like severe backlight leakage, poor color reproduction, discoloration, and what not. Even Dell, the undisputed king of computer monitors a decade ago, is these days receiving flak from users for poor quality products. Shame on LG, Samsung, Asus, Acer, Dell, and all other manufacturers for selling defective products to unsuspecting customers. While we customers struggle with returns and refunds, they get to sit on their laurels and count our hard-earned money. Not fair. Poor quality control practices are a LOSE-LOSE prospect for everyone. The CUSTOMER loses his faith. The SELLER loses his business. MANUFACTURER loses customers' trust and profits. So, why do it?

What now? For starters, I am not going to buy LG monitors anymore. Two failed products in a row is my threshold limit. I have neither patience nor money to waste on LG's junk anymore. I am also now totally apprehensive of buying any expensive products at Amazon because I am scared of putting myself through this tedious and uncertain process of returning/replacement/refund again. What if Amazon refuses to replace or return a defective product in future on some technicality in its policy? I'm starting to see disconcerting risk in it now. After many years, I am forced to reminisce the good old days when one could walk into a store; see a thing for what it is, touch it, feel it, use it; and if satisfied, order one for the household. In an email, I have appealed to Amazon to disclose return rates and/or other relevant data on product pages to enable customers to make informed decisions. This can also shame errant manufacturers into tightening their Quality Control checks. I hope Amazon's management will initiate positive and effective action in customers' interest.

I have requested for a return of this defective monitor. As and when the process is completed and I have received my funds, I will post a final update. Until then, üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.",1
"I have been splitting hair between 34 inch and 32 inch display. Having already used 32 inch monitor previously it was difficult for me to consider 27 inch. Interestingly there are way more options in 27 inch range. If you want IPS 4k panel, you will need 65k+ budget. In 34, if you go to 2k res it is again 68+k. I could see pixels in 32 inch full hd previously. Hence my criteria was 2k minimum with IPS. Frankly this was the only monitor that fits this criteria within budget. I am happy to report that with 2k res, everything is crisp. I love this ips panel, no light bleeding for me. Love the colors as well. You should know that this monitor runs at 60 H at 2K res and 75hz monitor at Full HD. This is NOT a 10 bit panel in case you were wondering. This is 8 bit panel and probably FRC to match 99% SRGB space. The monitor display is matt finish minimizing the reflection. The stand is sturdy and very well made. I did not like the HDR mode and prefer the standard mode. I bought this monitor for 25499 Rs. In USA this model is sold for much less(250 USD, 18000 INR). But that is the exact case for almost all monitor and electronic items. The monitor brightness is pretty good and i am running it at 77%. I like the dual controller where i can use the keyboard and mouse of pc1(hdmi1)to pc2(hdmi2). The box includes one hdmi and one display cable. The box delivered cleanly without any damage at all. The borders are really slim and that makes this monitor look beautiful. The matt screen floats front and the borders are inside the screen which looks so good. I have run the dead pixel and light bleeding test and happy to report my panel is flawless. I will use it for my office work and photo editing for which this monitor will be perfect. Remember 4k is going to be hard on your graphics card and 4k ips panels are crazy costly. So glad i got this finally. And if you are thinking about 34 inch dilemma like me do ask yourself is Full HD 34 ips or 2k 32 ips as they are similar budget. Attaching pictures to help you decide. Other reviews had not been helpful for me so i was in a doubt. I decided to make this review to help others like me. Get ready to spoil yourself. One thing i must note that when i connected external speakers via the headphone jack on the monitor the speakers were not very loud even at 100 percent, so i connected the speakers from the headphone jack from my laptop directly. One other thing is that the ports on the back is little flimsy as if you too much pressure to connect the HDMI, the entire port board seems to go inside, so just connect carefully.",5
"Quality is average, dosent look like 10 bit hdr sceen. Blacks are not true black. ,the price is drop by 3k after Amazon August sale, this is frustrating and seller is clearly deceptive.",1
"After using one year:
The monitor developed blind spots on all corners and the colors faded away. Many people reported this issue but I thought it was one of such issue. But not the case, this monitor not worth buying. Save your money on some other good one like Samsungs. Don't waster your money one this.

Following is my initial review after purchase:
This is the best monitor I have used so far. I was using Dell 24 inch full HD monitor and I want to upgrade to UHD just for the added real estate for my development environment. Here are some points I noted so far.

- The monitor works only at 30 fps with HDMI 1.4 output on UHD. 30 fps means lots of blurryness and flickering. So if you need 60 fps output, make sure your system supports HDMI 2.0 or have displayport available.
- If you are using Intel NUC, you may want to purchase mini-DP to DP conversion cable as NUC have only mini displayport.
- The monitor comes with DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable & HDMI cable in the package.
- The monitor can be tilted and height adjusted which is very convenient
- HDR mode is just awesome, the colors popup and sharp
- Since the edges are very narrow (near bezel-less), the size of monitor is same as my old 24 inch monitor

So overall, it is very good monitor and recommended for everyone.",1
"Bought monitor during non-sale time. Govt reduced gst for monitors. So price of the monitor gone down abit. I bought it for 34k and 1.5k cash back and zero cost 6 month EMI.
Coming to the monitor, i always prefer LG monitors with IPS panel. My previous monitor was a LG IPS 24 inch monitor, which served me more than 3 years without any problems. Picture quality of this 4k panel is so good. 28 inch is perfect size for gaming. Played alots of 4k games with xbox one X, including RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2, witcher 3 etc. Colors pops up. Even though the peak brightness of the monitor is 450nits, colors pops with all HDR enabled games. Played horizon zero dawn PS4 god of war and so many PS4 games with HDR, and I am not going back playing SDR games. God of war looks phenomenal even with base PS4 with HDR enabled. If you are a console gamer like me who doesn't prefer TV, GET THIS MONITOR. Worth every rupee.

There is small amount of bleeding in this monitor. Not noticeable generally.

Overall, i am totally satisfied with this monitor.",5
Gr8 picture quality but too much of backlight bleeding in my monitor. Thought of getting replaced with new one but only refund is available. Loosing my offers now,3
"Packaging was good. Delivery was quick. Make sure you buy from Appario Business seller on Amazon.

It was a surprisingly light weight box.
My First Glance Review :

1. I don‚Äôt think the panel supports HDR as Windows 10 refused to detect any HDR capabilities. HDR is listed only under effects as a kind of ‚Äúcolour filter‚Äù in the settings hence, HDR is not massively supported. This means, Netflix might not detect HDR capability in the display.

2. Brightness is very good indoors and even 60-70% is more than enough. The display also has an anti glare coating (nowhere mentioned) which makes it worth every penny in a studio environment where I have a window at the back and flood lights everywhere.

3. It‚Äôs a 75Hz panel that supports FreeSync1. Don‚Äôt expect smooth gaming but it is more than capable for office work, YouTube, emails, texts, media, etc.

4. You‚Äôll love the real estate of the screen. It‚Äôs huge and Windows10 does a great job at scaling.
Tip- Download LG‚Äôs OnScreen app to toggle modes on the fly.

5. The all-in-one single button can feel a bit flimsy to use but it‚Äôs a nice implementation.

6. The plastic body feels a bit cheap and scratchy however the brilliant display makes up for it.

Overall, not amazing for gaming or for consuming HDR content but good for everything else.

I‚Äôll update my review in a month to see if something changes.",4

The LG 27UK650 Constantly flickers while watching Youtube and on XBOX ONE X...Appario Retail Private Ltd- Going to return it. Kindly replace this defective Monitor,1
"The monitor is really good and even the IPS glow/bleeding is minimal but I'm using it with a Macbook Pro M1 and the text is really blurry. I think that MacOS is not really detecting the OS, as it shows it as a 31.5 monitor, while its actually 27.
Even the Onscreen Control app doesn't detect it. I'm waiting for an update from LG or from Apple.

For now if you wish to use it with Mac OS, avoid it or look for a 4K monitor.

Update:
So I was able to update the LG onscreen control app. The laptop now works fine in full native resolution of 2560x1440 but there is not way to scale UI to 125%, so every thing is really small. Its something that Windows supports but MacOS only supports 200% scaling and that too on 4K displays.

You can use SwitchResX to create a custom 1080p HiDpi resolution but it doesn‚Äôt work on new M1 macbooks, as of now 03-Feb 2021.
Tried both display port and hdmi methods. No luck.",4
"I researched a lot of monitors and narrowed to this and 32 inch from Lenovo. Both are quad HD. But this is way better - mainly with brightness and modes. Mine did not have any light bleeding or dead pixels - Luckily no issues.

I went with Quad HD not only since 4k is costly, but you will need a Display Port to get higher than 60 Hz on 4k. My laptop only has HDMI. also having Quad HD is better than Full HD for my photo editing.

Tips for work mode - I use with Reader mode and my eyes doesn't strain after few hours, like it used to do with my previous 24 inch. If you want really crisp text, set the resolution to Quad HD and then set the scaling to 200%. This way you can still work from 5/6 feet away and see clear text.

Movies and videos are really vivid. Try some wildlife or sea related videos, you will really see the colors. I haven't tried gaming on this yet. But tried to set at 75 Hz and it is good.

There are no individual buttons, but a single joystick like button to manage the settings. There is also OnScreen control software which you can download from LG website (there is nothing for this model, but you can install the software listed for some other model - it still works). For Windows OS, this is better than using joystick.

With windows I found no issues. With linux usage, I found some screen tearing with intel drivers on Quad HD resolution (I'm still researching how to fix this).",5

"Great Monitor...got this at 22999/- on great indian festival .... Using it for couple of days...
First Impression : Wow , just wow... no edge bleed no dead pixel nothing everything is perfect... ips glow is balanced... HDR option is great but at 22k price what i got i am happy with it... bcs HDR is a pricy aspect... but you will be happy with it...
Picture Quality: Is top notch... true ips panel with excellent viewing angle and color production ... true gem i can say...

Display port cable and hdmi cable will be provided with the container .... so no need to worry.... just buy it without any second thought... and yeah you can enable gsync with it... it has freesync version 2... so you can enable it with gsync via nvidia control panel...

"Update Dec 2020:- After replacing display panel 3 times in just 2 months. LG replaced the unit in OCT 2020. Since then it is working fine. I will update review again if I face any issue. Also warranty is for 3 years not 1 Year which I assumed earlier.

I have used Samsung, Dell and HP monitor in last 15 years. This LG monitor is worst. Cheap quality plastic has been used.

Now the real issue. I have purchased the monitor in Sept 2019. After 2 months (Dec 2019). it started to show black line on right side. Since it was under warranty, Screen panel was replaced by LG.
In March 2020, At the time when India (most of the world) is under lock down and we need to work from home. This LG Monitor stated to show red color in all four corners. As day starts it screen looks normal and as day progress red color started to spread and become darker. It is still in warranty so I will get it repair when lock down will be taken off.

I didn't except 2 big issues in just 6 months of usage. I will push hard to refund or replace the whole monitor not the just part in it.

Now my bigger concern is what will happen after 6 months when warranty will end. I think repair cost will be huge.

PLEASE DONT BUY IT. EVEN YOUR ARE GETTING IT CHEAP UNDER ANY SALES & OFFERS.",1
"Bought this monitor on prime day sale and it's working flawlessly. Ppl who are saying it doesn't have HDR10 just bcz of 350 nits brightness they should get some hardware knowledge and can check this monitor specifications on LG website too. It's not a typical TN panel with 1000 nits brightness lol.

So far it's working good , display and colour quality is gorgeous , software is easy to use , multiple modes to suite your needs and many more.",5
"My unit has one dead pixel in the lower right corner when new.

The stand is absolute rubbish. The monitor is always shaking, even while (for example) typing on a keyboard in close proximity.

The panel itself (my sample at least) had minimal IPS glow and close to zero backlight bleeding. This was the major consideration to not return the monitor as there was never any guarantee that a replacement would not present those other issues.

The colours are excellent and you get three- and six-colour adjustments which help get a more accurate presentation. The pixel pitch is just right for slightly older eyes - not so small as to make text hard to read, and individual pixels are just about indistinguishable at a couple of feet.

The 75Hz limit is problematic for those looking for high-refresh panels, but this has no aspirations to gaming anyway, so it's a compromise. ARGB support is really the only thing that makes this uncompetitive with my Dell U3017, the colours are slightly off even with a wide-ish gamut. But that cost three times as much, so it's not a fair comparison.",5
"This was my first LG monitor(probably the last as well) and the first thing i noticed out of the box was the display was not calibrated as can be seen on the features page. So, took a while for me to set it up and trust me it was not easy. So, overall it was tedious process.
The comes the backlight bleed test which was so uneven when seen from different angles. Primarily, the right half of the screen looked off which i assumed for IPS glow but then did some research, compared it side by side to some other IPS monitors only to find out this cannot be entirely IPS glow. This was a mix of IPS glow, backlight bleed and poor panel assembly. Hence, had to return it which was hassle free thanks to Amazon.
The replacement was delivered the next day, and that was a complete disaster!! it was a used product with power on time of 37 hrs along with the issues listed above amplified which was quite obvious considering it was a used one. So, this is the first time facing this issue with the seller as its a reputed one and have previously purchased lot of products from this seller which were clean. So, not really sure what went wrong this time.
So, coming to this product would say the build is good however the quality control by LG should have been much better. Would not discourage to go for it as all panels are not equally made so you never know you might get a good piece.",2
"Bought this for 27,000 Rs. The Monitor is an effective option at this price range for 32 inches as Acer is the only other manufacturer that decently prices monitors in India. Prior to this I had a 32"" Full HD Acer Monitor which was average. This monitor has a nice matte coating and its color reproduction is the best I've seen in an LG. No issues with PWM on low brightness. The viewing angles are good. There is no back light bleed on my unit or any dead pixels. Consider the speakers to be non-existent.
The unit is very easy to setup after removing the packaging. Takes about three minutes to set it up. If your priority isn't FPS gaming or Art Editing, this monitor is probably the best 32"" choice you have in India as those two setups would anyway cost you more than a lakh. QHD is also a perfect resolution in this size for casual use such as office work, entertainment and gaming. 4K would be overkill and too graphic card and memory intensive at this point. The jump from 60 to 75 Hz is noticeably better though I didn't expect any change. As a film producer, I've seen and used a lot of professional equipment and know that this is a good purchase. Will give a 4.4/5",5
"It works flawlessly with my PS4 pro with resolution set to max and HDR turned on without any hiccups. It has two HDMI Ports HDMI 1 & HDMI 2 you can easily connect PC in one port and console on other port and switch between them by pressing provided button going to input. It also have different kinds of display presets for gaming like FPS 1, FPS 2 and few other modes. You can customize as per your liking in the custom mode. It has audio jack just above DC adapter connection behind the panel. Through which you can connect your headphones/speakers without even needing the audio jack in the PC. Display is IPS, Res- 4K and supports HDR10, display latency- 5ms. So if you have a gaming PC or consoles like XBOX One X or PS4 PRO then this monitor would be your choice in this price segment.",5
"Using this for programming, video & photo editing.
Very good colors, excellent balance of cost and quality for a 4K UHD computer monitor.",5
"Worst thing about this monitor is price bought it on prime day sale for 26k and current price is 24k....
About screen - great viewing angles, good color reproduction... Its not true HDR, not meant for gaming... Bing problem is even FULLHD videos will not look great in this screen you need minimum 2k video.... For that u need good internet connection.... Love sports doesn't look best trust me even though I've 100mbps connection.... So consider these before buying",1
"Let me begin saying that I use this 4K monitor as an external display for my 2018 MBP. The colors and contrast are just impeccable. I'm an engineer and a photographer by trade so I LOVE to see proper color reproduction and at the same clean, crisp, anti-aliased text when I am coding.
The packaging on this is beautifully done! The product came in good shape and I haven't had any issues like other's complain. I'm sorry it has happened to you. Electronic items like these are a throw of dice sometimes.

Anyhoo, right out the box the contrast, brightness and gamma didn't look that great so I tweaked the settings according to the lighting in my room to fit the bill. TIP: I try to match the display quality with my MBP's retina display to get that consistency. You could also go deeper into the color config of the monitor RGB's HS (hue and saturation) sliders if you want to ""fine tune"". If you are using this for your MacBook, please make sure you calibrate the display and create a profile for it (under System Preferences>Displays>Color).
Cable management is neatly done behind the display panel I love how wireless my desk looks!

Picture quality is rock solid. And for the price (~31-32k) it think it an amazing value for money. Also, if you guys are using MacBook Pro with this display, please buy a cable good enough to give you 60Hz frame rate on the Display Port (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07BBHCPXH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)",5
"1. All HDR display flavours won't work except HDR effect, will not use vivid option in on screen support software from LG site
2. When attached to type-c 4k 60htz the HDR video will stuck for fraction of second intermittently
3. While using as a duan monitor with Lenovo yoga s740 or 750, the apps will crash with her enabled and with max resolution and dpi set to around 125%. I am sure about this testing because when I used 27UL500 on same laptops everything was stable.
4. When split more is enabled for 4 windows then apps will flicker frequently.
5. Using MS Teams for video or audio call in monitor screen will crash the application when it works fine on laptop main display itself and also work fine with LG 27UL500 model so offcourse it's ab issue with this monitor and it's compatibility with Lenovo yoga s740 4k ips laptop.",1
"I'm using this with a Ryzen 3700x and Geforce RTX 2070.

Pros
- Decent sharpness as you expect from LG
- Stylish stand, thin bezels. Good for multi monitor setup
- Color calibration is good for Photo/Video editing.
- VESA mount compatible
- Works with LG display software. Saves unnecessary button clicks.
- Comes with both Display and HDMI cables.
- Minimal branding. Great for aesthetics.
- Audio out

Cons
- Brightness issue. I have another 27inch LG27GL650F FHD monitor side by side and the brightness is lower compared to that. I had to spend a lot of time calibrating and trying out different profiles to reach an acceptable level of brightness. Problem seems to be in the firmware rather than the display itself.
- Takes a lot of time to calibrate. Specially if you are connecting through HDMI, the brightness seems washed out.
- Overpriced in India. Should not be more than 30-31K.
- No G-Sync. Not suitable for competitive gaming if you have an Nvidia Card.
- In FHD mode (125% zoom), icons gets pixelated. No super sampling.
- Viewing angle is not that great this being an IPS panel. Expected better from LG.

If you are looking for a 4K for media consumption, light gaming and decent Photo/Video editing, go for it. For anything more than that, you might want to go for a Samsung display.",4
"Best budget 4k @60Hz display for gaming(4k alert, RTX2080TI recommended), moderate lvl creativity(99% sRGB only) and HDR(entry level, but still very bright +350 nits, eyes strain alert). I was really doubtful about Indian stock quality after reading so many negative reviews. But I received a perfect screen with no back light bleed(as it should be). Although IPS glow(which is normal for IPS panels) is there and you might notice that in a dark room with a dark scene/image. But definitely not a deal breaker considering the selling price.

Update: Display showing image retention issue. See pics. Selling lower quality monitors in India.",2
"I bought this monitor in sale in Nov/Dec 2019.

It's refresh rate is advertised 60Hz but with it's cable provided and extra cables I had, it doesn't seem to work.
After seeing review, I tried different cables, USB type C hub etc etc.. but it didn't work as I expected and as it is advertised.

What I tried:
1. A dozen HDMI cable. USB Type C Hub.
2. Provided HDMI and DP cable.

Result: Refresh rate at 30Hz with No HDR. (See attached pictures).
Expectation: Refresh Rate at 60 Hz with HDR as advertised here at Amazon or site.

Advise: Avoid this purchase if you are expecting 60 Hz and HDR as features on 4k.

Oct 5, 2020: Sorry for creating confusion. My sincere apolise for above comments.
1. It does support HDR and refresh rate 60Hz.

My laptop supported HDMI 1.4 that's why it was not working. Buying a usb c to HDMI cable worked perfectly.",5
"This monitor works perfectly for office work and very light casual gaming.even if you are a moderate, it becomes extremely difficult to connect the monitor to your your PC as many PCs have different display ports like the mini display port, type c and HDMI. It is very difficult in India to find a reliable 4K converters for that matter even 4K cables. HDR in this monitor does not work that great so if you are looking for HDR effect then you will be hundred percent disappointed. The response rate of the monitor is fine.one more throwback for this monitor is that it does not get recognised as plug and play you have to manually download the software from LG website. I am using the latest version of windows 10 operating system but even then there is no plug and play.",4
"So, I've finally ungraded my 21"" FHD monitor to this 4k 27"" one. Overall it's very good for me but there are some things which you should know before buying.

Not plug and play:
When I first plugged this monitor in, It was running at 1024x768 but I've found drivers on LG's site and soon it was running at it's full glory 4k.

About Gaming on 4k:
you'll need a very powerful GPU to play AAA titles in 4k, If you think you'll game at 1080p on this big monitor better not buy it because 1080p on screen this big is not looking good as compared to 21"" FHD panel but 2k gaming does look good so you better have a GPU that can run your games at 2k for the least.

About HDR 10
It's not much useful. Some supported games give you prompt to enable HDR but some other supported games made you enable HDR in windows settings and that's where it gets messier because desktop apps does not support HDR and they look bad just like most other non HDR games which also look same as desktop when HDR is ON: over sharp, over contrast, everything blown out, so you can't just keep HDR on in windows settings.

About Picture in picture mode:
PIP need extra software which you'll get automatically while installing LG's drivers but PIP is not inbuild in the monitor menu itself. I haven't tried PIP but I think it'll work fine.

Overall;
it's little expensive for what it offers, I mean there are 28"" Tn panels for 26k available and I got this for 34k only because of it's looks. If you want thin bezels, elegent looks, awesome picture quality and you already have a powerful graphic card that can run games at 4k or 2k, you can buy this monitor.",4
"- The resolution is good but compatibility with various devices like firestick or even computers is not quite good. Cannot make the full use of the resolution.
- Colors are not accurate straight out of the box. It is very hard to set it.
- Menu/Software is not quite good to make the best use of the resolution. No manuals provided.
- Headphone jack is of very cheap quality. Audio out of it is CRAPPY. There is also a small delay noticed.
- Made of cheap plastic.
- For watching TV, even 10K worth of TV would do much better.
- Adaptive Response time is not quite good. Not smooth most of the time.
- NO RETURN is so ridiculous. Forcing to keep a inferior quality product.
- LG customer care of not quite prompt and does not sound knowledgeable.",2
"Best monitor you can buy in this price range. I wanted a QHD monitor since 4k is limited on content and need proper GPU to run smooth ( issue with office laptops). This monitor has excellent colors, contrast, viewing angles and ports. I got it for 25k and run great on 75Hz at 2k.

HDR playback is also very good( tested on youtube), people saying you need 1000 nits for proper HDR need to check again since HDR has different standards. A reputed company like LG won't say its HDR without proper certification.",5
"Pathetic Seller he sold a defective piece and i had run behind LG for getting it fixed. As per LG they will replace only with in 1 month of purchase and amazon also has the same policy so finally after repairing it, again with in 1 year of repair same issue resurfaces. now again i have to run behind LG. its been an year and not even a single apology or any concern from the seller. Always the same one liner we cant do anything its passed the replacement window from Amazon.",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The monitor is good if there are lots of bright stuff on screen and/or the room is well lit. Terrible backlight bleeding right from unpacking, not at all good for watching movies or anything with dark scenes or backgrounds. HDR is a gimmick at best on PC and doesn't work well, colors seemed washed out - you'd have to dig deep into nvidia settings and tweak to get a proper output for HDR content.

Connects fine with HDMI but the display port does not support HDR. Xbox One detected HDR and switches to it while playing games or video.",2
"Orderd on 23 dec 20.
Delivered 25 decide 20.
Reviewed on 4 Jan 20.
It is a good budget 2k (1440p) monitor. Received both dp and hdmi cable. Make sure while connecting your dp port don't have any part of cabinate coming out as obstacle for connection. Because the dp cable has larger connector part, otherwise you will see no display. Refresh rate is 75hz on 1440p resolution through dp cable, did not try on hdmi cable. Thankfully no dead pixel, no ips glow even in dark room. Also stand is not thay wobbly. Enjoying old games at 2k with dual core (pentium g4500) and r7 260x 1gb. Even crysis 2 is running good and 2k with highest setting. It has Freesync2 version and working great. No real hdr, it is just increasing brightness and adjusting the other parameter.
Try contrast 60-70, brightness 50-57 to enjoy good colour and to protect eyes.
Final verdict it is good to enjoy 2k gaming, watching movies for regular and casual user/ gamer.",4
"My experience with Macbook pro 2015 which comes with Thunderbolt2 port also know as Mini Display port.
The monitor comes with HDMI and Display Port cable. Both these cables are useless.
I was able to get 30hz refresh rate with stock cable. After doing some research I ordered
1. High speed HDMI cable ( 18 gbps ) from Amazon. With this cable I was able to get 60 hz for 1440 after tweaking display setting and using low resolution option.
2. I tried with mini dp to HDMI adapter which I had already but it was not able to support anything above 30 hz
3. Finally I ordered Mini DP to DP cable [https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07C5Z5D1Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1] and this worked well. This is the only option to drive 4K with macbook pro.",4
"Seeing the specs, I bought the product without giving a 2nd thought, only to be severely disappointed.
It looks nothing more than a 32 inch FHD (while being categorized as QHD), forget about any HDR difference.
I am not sure why LG would try to dampen its brand value by launching this product and cheating the customers with misinformation.

I am a programmer by profession, having gaming as my hobby and this suffices neither of those needs.
Avoid buying this product and look for other options.",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 My primary requirement is to have a monitor with lots of screen space and less stressful on eyes when programming for long duration... Occasionally I watch movies .... It is a treat to do all these with this monitor.... No dead pixels... No backlight bleeding... No eye strain even after sitting before for hours... I sit 3.5 ft away from monitor... 2 HDMI ports... 1 display port.... This monitor perfectly meets my requirements... I am happy I chose 32 inch over 27 inch... It really allows me to sit comfortably 3.5 feet away and still see everything clearly....

No usb support... No speakers... No height adjustment.... These are no issue for me.... But if someone wants these they need to look at other monitors....

Vivid IPS display. Bought for 21.5k... Worth it...",5
"This 32 inch QHD LG monitor I purchased after returning Benq FHD EW series 27 inch monitor. The biggest issue with Benq monitor I had was its colour representation which was awful. White was displayed as Grey. 2nd Big issue with Benq monitor was its brightness being too low even for a 250 nits lit monitor.

Thankfully none of the above mentioned issue is there with LG. It is colour calibarated and that shows up. Brightness is of 350 nits which is very helpful in daylight viewing and the plus is having its anti reflective coating. The QHD resolution is definitely a big plus for 32 inch size of monitor. I am fully satisfied with this LG monitor performance. I am not much of a gamer but I have set up my monitor on 75 Hz and it is working fine.

At the end I would say:
Pros:
+ Good colour calibration/display/representation.
+ 350 nits brightness is realy helpful in daylight usage.
+ QHD is the way to go for a 32 inch monitor and even recommended for smaller size monitor as well.
+ Lots of colour/picture presets.
+ PC Software to control monitor setting.

Cons:
- IPS glow is evident espcially for darker scenes and in dark room. But it is not too distracting and somewhat managable. Personally, I can live with this con than having to compromise on image quality and clarity.
- No inbuilt speaker
- Headphone out on the monitor works sometimes. I am using it with Lenovo laptop which has NVidia GPU.",5
"This monitor is a gateway drug to the world of 4k. The price is very similar to price of this monitor in the US so its great value for money. Quality is top notch, as expected from LG.
I have no issues with the panel, using it with Mac Mini 2018. Although using it in scaled resolution (2560 x 1440) takes a bit of a toll on the CPU (I have 6 Core i7 version), that could be because my system has a sub par GPU, but its easily ignorable.
Very happy with the monitor, I'm happy that I did not buy UK850 version and saved myself more than ‚Çπ10K, as its the same panel. I bought AmazonBasics USB C to Display port adapter to connect with one of my USB C ports.",5
"I have the fully maxed out Macbook pro and never really used an external display before. I am using the USB C to Display port connector to connect to the monitor and so far it looks good. I am actually able to see my browser/simulator and the code editor on the large screen at the same time and it's super smooth at 60 Hz. Productivity has increased by leaps!

There isn't anything in particular that I don't like, maybe the hassle of buying an external adaptor and that initially my Macbook Pro CPU usage was on the higher side when connected to the display, but a quick SMC reset solved that and now it's pretty smooth workflow. I keep the laptop closed and work with wireless keyboard and trackpad.

Keeping fingers crossed, hoping for no crappy screen issues.",4
"This is a stunningly beautiful monitor, I come from FHD and at this size FHD offers pixelated display. Difference between FHD and QHD is night and day. The colours on this monitor are vivid and not washed out. Bought this in lightning deal and I'm very happy with the purchase. My PS4 is able to use HDR10 and the experience is mind blowing. Highly recommended.",5
"The 27 inch 4k monitor offers very good picture quality. Getting around with correct settings can be a bit tricky. Once done, it is worth it. Monitor is very bright, colour quality is superior to an LED monitor. Luckily received a unit without the infamous backlight bleeding. The product was imported on June 2019. Probably they have addressed that issue in the new units.
HDR option when enabled seemed to be just fine, as in some instances it was ruining the contrast. Gaming also felt smooth. Bought for 29749 rs during Prime Day sale.",5
"The first one I received had clouding issue and Amazon replaced it. The replacement was a much better than first panel but noticed a dead pixel and I decided to return the product. I ordered another brand‚Äôs monitor and that turned out to be more suitable for me after returning this. I have many appliances from LG in home but never faced a quality issue like this.

The monitor is not height adjustable and may go above your eye level. I bought the monitor for work from home purposes and only tested those functionalities. Ports have very good accessibility.

Amazon was very helpful in both times and I had a hassle free exchange.",2
"Its 4k with HDR.
well until n unless u have a bluray player .u willnot be able to see the HDR cuz windows hdr support is crappy ..just doesnt work.

The SDR to HDR upscaling is great ..i mean even a sdr picture looks damn great in SDR to HDR upsclaing mode.

for gaming. the 60fps .u need to have a pc which can pump out 70+ fps ..othrwise ..the AMD freesync wont do its job. It will be crappy . two frames colliding with each other.

for content creation. coding .its a really great monitor with the added rotation feature with which u can rotate it and keep the monitor vertical",5
"Very good monitor for creators,gamers. Though HDR in monitors is no way close to TVs but it's good for HDR movies and games. Black level are decent though not in league of Samsung VA monitors but viewing angles and color reproduction are far better than those. Added benefit of this monitor is stand which is sturdy and is hieght and tilt adjustable. Monitor supports freesync with AMD cards but also works with Nvidia cards over DP only. Comes with a CD having drivers for dual monitor setup and on screen controls. Out of box color reproduction is very good but some tweaking is required for adjusting black levels according to the ambient light in your room. Over all no monitor at this price gets this much functionality and quality",5
"My quest to find the better monitor on budget ends here. I order dell 32inch 1080 first, had it replaced twice for dead pixels first time and for heavy light bleeding second time then return it because 1080p doesn't suit the 32inch display.

After some research I chose this LG 32"" 2k display.

Pro
* Picture quality is much better
* 2k at 32""
* Menus are super easy to navigate withsingle joystick kinda switch.
* Two hdmi and one display port.
* colors are way better than Dell 32inch.
* easy clamp and go stands
* Brightness

Con

* HDR10 is such Hoax, my rs-10k 32inch iffalcon has better HDR. This is not at a HDR for sure.
* build quality is very decent, connect between the stand and monitor is so fragile that monitor shakes for minimal handling.
* body looks cheap.
* Again HDR is bad.

This specific peice too had minimal light bleeding at the top portion of the monitor but its bearable, i don't wanna end up getting more on my next replacement so sticking to this.",4
"27UK650-W white, I got this today 23-3-2020 and i think my panel is good. It has some IPS glow, but i think, it has no backlight bleeding issue. But panel heat / hot up, I think about 30 Celsius, my be constantly temp.

The first image is 53% brighter setting and 2nd is 100% brighter setting. My upload image is not correct. Because mobile camera boost color and brighter the panel. That's why you see blue color rather then black. So do not trust fully, what is in the image. But yes, from my eye sometimes i notice bottom backlight, but not from upper corners.

Picture quality and brininess is good.

In my monitor, i did not get energy sticker bottom right. I think some one use this monitor, or may be something else. Please let me know if you also not get energy sticker.

Color setting - Set Default custom color, because it factory calibrated. Set Brightness max at 30 or low as you want. Set Contrast at max 70 and low 50. But i will recommend do not change Contrast setting, and set it at 70.
Set Black Stabilizer at min 30 and max 50.",4
"Excellent performance. Good picture, viewing angle and brightness. The stand is pretty good with very smooth height adjustment. Menus and navigation is easy with the tiny joystick single control. Only problem is no direct access to switch input sources or adjust brightness. Switching sources needs 4 clicks into menu and takes 3 seconds each time. So if you switch sources several times a day, this is cumbersome.

Used daily for a month. Haven't found any color bleed on the corners as mentioned in some reviews, but tend to think that is more related to rough handling. If you take care not to put uneven pressure on the panel or bend it when unpacking and setting up, should be ok.",5
"The design is really good and the bezel less IPS display is beautiful.
But what's the point of all these if the screen starts creating issues just in 4 months. This is absolutely ridiculous considering the price. LG should improve on quality checks.
The screen has started bleeding from all corners. Please stay away from this product.",1
"I was thinking of getting the 32"" model but then decided against it as 1440p is best suited for 27"" model. It was delivered in 2 days - Amazon delivery is on point. No complains there.

Coming to the product, I had to get my first one replaced because it had some stuck pixels. The replacement unit has some loose part inside which rattles when you move the monitor. But since it is working fine, I decided to keep it. LG definitely needs to improve its QA.

It has a little bit of IPS glow and the blacks aren't as deep as my Samsung IPS monitor. You may need to adjust the color to your liking as the default are generic settings. I just couldn't get the blues right. Not sure why LG calls it color calibrated. HDR works with Windows but may not be to everyone's liking. I keep it off.",4
Earlier I used dell 24 inches Full HD monitor later I upgraded recently to LG 29 ultra wide 2 k. Satisfied with its quality now I bought this For 4k monitor. Factory calibrated colour s and 99 %srgb which I liked as I use for video editing.,4
"Great picture quality, like most things about the product, but has a little bit of backlight bleeding on bottom right and left corners. Just hoping that it doesn't grow with time.

Didn't get it replaced as it was minor and my case + didn't want to get through the hassle in lockdown times, but beware of it. I hear the newer model LG UL500 does not have backlight bleeding issues like this one. But then, that other one doesn't have height adjustability or swivel.",3
"Bought this for 33K. The monitor has thin bezels, look very good. Upgrading from 1600*900, this monitor is such a big & awesome upgrade.
The monitor has 2 HDMI and 1 DP. The HDMI has some mouse stutter issue while the DP doesn't. I'd recommend people to use the DP over HDMI..
Being watching some HDR compliant movies in 4k and they look awesome... Scaling is not proper as I have to zoom in 150%, which is not the native..",5
"Review after 2 months.
Using it with PS4 and for processing pictures in Adobe LR. The color quality and representation is great. Gaming is crisp. So far no issues. The design is catchy, artistic and aesthetically pleasing.

The bleeding issues mentioned by some people here is noticeable only if you are watching it with lights off and your screen is dark at that moment.

Got it for Rs. 28000/- during the sale in September -2019 with No cost EMI discount. Would suggest you to wait for the sale and then buy it with discount and other offers.",4
"Great display for work and gaming. Colour accuracy is good, QHD resolution is good enough for programming and IPS makes a world of difference as 32‚Äù is huge and with normal VA/TN panels you‚Äôd get colour distortion while sitting close to the display and panning your eyes to the sides.
There are some gamin specific settings as well to improve response times with AMD Freesync.

Panel has an anti reflective coating on it. Both HDMI and standard display cable are provided in the box.

Other users have complained about the backlight bleed. I think it is so less that it can pretty much be ignored.

A really good display with QHD and IPS tech especially at this price point.",5

"Nice for images and video, not good for text. The 2k resolution on a 32 inch screen is just too low.",3
"This monitor is a little costly so only buy it if you absolutely are a pro user. Further, a major downside is that it doesn't come with speakers and getting LG Screen Manager software is a little clumsy if you are not using the provided disk.",1
"A blessing in the WFH era. I bought this for office work, so cannot comment on its gaming prowess. For regular office stuff of spreadsheets and visio diagrams it performs very well.

The base is solid and height adjust / swivel is great if you don't have a monitor arm. Brightness is good, have placed it next to a window and it is comfortable to use.

The nipple 4way control is a bit weird but thankfully don't have to use it often.",5
"Turned out to be a good buy for me. There wasn‚Äôt any screen bleeding or defect in this piece unlike other reviews. It‚Äôs matter of luck I guess.
Only problem I could find is that with windows 10, if I increase refresh rate to 75hz, the bit depth for color goes to 8bit instead of 10bit. Doesn‚Äôt seems worth losing color depth, when you have bought IPS display, for increase in refresh rate. Both would have been great.
I don‚Äôt know if this is software issue or hardware. I have a good APU and Windows 10, so I think this is not the issue.
Plus it‚Äôs the cheapest 32inch 2k display aside from acer.
The blacks are not deep black. Means it lacks contrast. But this can be attributed to IPS glow which is a known issue in IPS display.
I still believe it‚Äôs worth the price.
4K monitor would be better but that means shelling out another 8k-10k which wasn‚Äôt worth for me.",4
"I am a vfx artist and color accuracy matters to me. When I was ordering LG 32QN600, I was a bit skeptical because of its cheap price for its size, resolution and features, and the fact that the panel is actually made by BOE (Chinese company). But the reviews were good so I took the leap of faith. And now that I have it, I am blown away. It has put my old Dell Ultrasharp to shame. As you can see in the image attached, the colors of this monitor are much closer to my iPad Air 3 compared to my old Dell. I am very satisfied with the picture quality. IPS glow is minimal, white/grey/blacks are perfectly neutral. No tint whatsoever to the naked eye. Don't expect amazing HDR at this price point. However this is just an initial reaction. I am yet to see how reliable is it for long working hours.",5
"This is purely a monitor for high productivity. I use it best for work. It is not good for gaming because the screen is too big.. 27 inch should be good.. also only 60 hdz refresh rate. 1080p content does not look good on full screen, so would not recommend for viewing movies/ you tube on full screen.

All said I am happy because it meets my use.. and 1440p content looks great.",4
"Amazing display with ample ports and awesome HDR .... I'm using it with my MacBook pro and PS4 .. it's a great monitor for coding and media consumption ...

Pros:
1. Best 4k monitor in the market
2. Awesome color reproduction
3. Monitor is pretty bright in the dark

Cons:
1. Wish there was USB ports like in 27UK850
2. Had a rotating base like Dell monitors
3. Slight curved display would have been awesome viewing experience

the main difference between uk850 and uk650 is the addition of thunderbolt 3 port and 2 USB 3.0 ports and 10k increase in price tag.

If you have device that supports TB3 u can go for the uk850, or if u can live the dongle life I would say uk650 is a better choice ..

One thing to remember is your windows and fonts will look really small if you scale all the resolution all the way up to 4k",5
"This monitor is showing red color corners. Not a year finished since it purchased, this monitor started showing faults.",1
"display flicker on mac prom, windows little ok , LG software buggy. takes quite a time to sync after boot. screen blacks out many time during work. split window software is very buggy.",3
"I bought it yesterday and it delivered to me today, the faulty one, I did connected it to MacBook Pro, also tried with lenovo laptop with hdmi port.
And it displays black screen, I did turn on display, both of my laptop able to detect second screen but not the monitor.
Called customer care as there is no direct return option only replacement. Waiting for their response.",1
"Bought the 27QN600 QHD monitor for 23K and satisfied with the purchase. Not tried gaming its is based on general content viewing for works and watching video.

I am connecting it as an extended display for my Macbook pro. Was planning to but 4K but for 27"" 2K is good enough.
For regular use and work I need to scale the monitor to get it readable. Even for media work this should be good monitor.

Pros
Colour reproduction is great
HDR is decent
2K HDR IPS Freesync borderless display in 20K range
The joystick based control at the bottom for adjustments
2 HDMI and 1 DP and 1 audio out port

Cons
The stand is very basic and fixed. Cant adjust height. But a clip on type and easy to install
The ports at back can be little more sturdy as we attempt to push the cable in but its not bad
No speakers - but I am good since there is audio out.

I would recommend to buy.",4
"This display I purchased on 25 sep 2018 @ 40 k , but with in 11 months it got problem
I don‚Äôt recommend this product to any one",1
"This is the best 27 inch 4k monitor money can buy (assuming you don‚Äôt need USB-C, if you absolutely need USB-C go for 27UK850).
Colors are vivid, accurate and resembles the color of an iMac. You won‚Äôt see any individual pixel from a reasonable distance (1 ft 9 inches). Texts are sharp like a fine printed book.
Go for it.

Note: It‚Äôs not a true 10 bit panel. It uses Frame Rate Control (FRC) to simulate 10 bit color.

DP Port: 4K @60Hz (10 bit)
HDMI: 4K @60Hz (8 bit).

Go. Buy one. You wont be disappointed.",5
"Using MacBook Pro, observed green vertical line.
Connected with PS4 Pro as well, still getting the same green vertical line.

Thanks to Amazon, monitor got replaced.

Apart from this issue, monitor is very crisp and clear.
Once you start using 4K monitor, it's very difficult to switch back FHD or QHD resolution.

Good for Gaming, watching movie and coding.",5
"I have used Samsung monitors previously , So just for a change i ordered LG 2k 32 inch monitor .The build quality is subpar when compared with Samsung.Also was able to see too much IPS glow in Dark.Even the monitor stand is made from low quality plastic and the monitor itself is not sturdy enough .My opinion Go for samsung. I was planning on purchasing a 4K TV ,now i do not want to go with LG. This is just a review on LG monitor not on the seller or Amazon. And i dont think i can return this monitor .""Since it is replacement only"".",3
"First of all, this is a budget QHD monitor. Best for WFH unless your work involves designing, editing, and gaming. For an average user, it does the job well most of the times. In terms of IPS glow, the monitor I received did have on the edges, but it is minimal. HDR performance is below average.

Mac users are better off with the 27-inch model. 32 inch is best suited for 4K resolution with more pixels in it.",5
"Had high expectations on LG. But product is of very bad quality. Received it from authorised seller ""Appario"". But the box packing was pathetic. The monitor has to be replaced bcz got a damaged product.

Even the replacement came with screen bleeding issue. Packing is worse the second time as well",1
Amazing Pic Clarity I love display Quality I used for Video Editing and Photoshop the colour Accuracy is Great Awesome,5
"- Less than 5 minutes to assemble and replace my existing monitor. No tools required to mount the monitor to the stand.
- Monitor is tilt adjustable only (not height).
- 5 foot long HDMI cable included.
- Power cord comes in two parts with a normal sized plug on one half and the power brick on the other.
- Resolution is great, no dead pixels. There is slight backlight bleed but that is to be expected from an IPS screen
- Colour is great for editing videos, watching streaming content from Netflix, Amazon and Youtube as well.

Overall, everything is a I expected for the specs and price range.",5
"Update:

Post my multiple complaints the LG engineer visited and diagnosed a display issue and a new display was ordered. The engineer visited again to replace the damaged display with the new display but he as struggling to get it to work and the new display never worked. So he put the old display back and left. LG has become a joke. I‚Äôve had the need for another monitor lately and went for Lenovo and I recommend none of you choose LG; LG makes good looking but worst quality monitors. Cheers.

Original review:

This is the worst monitor I‚Äôve purchased ever. Seemed like a good buy while ordering but have been facing severe edge bleeding within 1 year if my purchase and the monitor has a 3 year warranty. The quality of the product is very very substandard and I request all prospective buyers to be very very careful while buying this. I‚Äôve seen many other reviews with the same issue and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be a one off case. LG really needs to make sure that a monitor in this pride range doesn‚Äôt have such issues within months of the purchase. Request Amazon for a replacement ASAP else I‚Äôll have no option but to escalate this to the Amazon India and LG management and call them out for this quality and service. Such a shame. I almost feel scammed.",1
Am OK with this monitor when it comes to pixel; but not satisfied with the response. When i connect my laptop to LG monitor @3840*2160 its only available as 30FPS (see screenshot) due to which 4K videos are kind of lag/stuck in between. If 4K can't support 60FPS what is the point of buying this monitor; FYI.. am using provided cable and no issues with the internet speed. Also another issue is scaling size you always have to resize it if you want to use your laptop again for which you have to sign-out. I've tested this with multiple laptops and HD Graphics 520 & 620 but still don't get beyond 30FPS where as when connected to Laptop only i get 60FPS @3840*2160.. Not Happy....!,1
"Amazing screen. Bought this for WFH purpose. I wanted to do one time investment on the monitor and nothing could have been better than this one. Bought the 32 Inches monitor and I am totally loving it. Worth buying. And I suggested the same to my colleaguea also, he is also loving it.",5
backlight bleeding on the new monitor,1
"I purchased this laptop on May 2019 and used for graphics designing. But after a year of use it's showing heavy brightness bleed, which is clearly visible and most annoying thing while working. The bleed includes red and blue colors at the corner and edges. So don't spend your valuable money for this product. Disappointed with LG.",1
Searching for monitor for a while and finally decided to buy this monitor.2k resolution but runs 4k like charm thou 2k seems litlle pixely 4k looks very clear. Hdr is not up to mark and miss height adjustable stand so 4 star. Must buy and will review again after few days of use,4
"This is a fantastic monitor with 27 inch being the perfect size for me . Great picture quality and brightness.

Packaging was great and it was delivered on time.

It comes with a single HDMI cable but has 2 HDMI and 1 Display Ports. Just get the additional HDMI or DP cable separately and it's very easy to switch inputs from the screen itself instead of fiddling with the cables every time you want to connect a different device.

Also , this monitor tilts upwards (for adjusting based on seating / standing height) and rotates 90 degrees if you want to use it in the portrait mode. These are 2 very useful functionalities which I never really felt the need for until I bought this monitor.

I just hope this was around the 25K mark instead of the 37K that I paid for it.",4
"Doesn't Support HDR in Xbox Series Consoles, Very Inferior HDMI. NOT able to get higher frame rates in 1080p and 1440p for xbox(mostly stuck at 30Hz).Switching between displays is hassle.",3
"The monitor performs very well for the intended use and more than met my expectations. I am not a gamer but a regular computer user. I also use it for entertainment. It has a wonderful menu button, joystick like, which allows very easy access to a plethora of options, providing the capability to customize for a variety of applications. It has Matte finish and thus bright environments are not a problem as reflections, if any, are not noticeable.",5
"As an editor, its IPS Panel is very crisp and clear for my everyday use. I switched from BENQ to LG and I can really feel the difference in the color accuracy.

The thin bezels on the monitor make it very elegant, however, there is a tiny amount of light bleed if the brightness is too low, however this happens to all thin bezel IPS monitors and isn't a major concern for this one.

Would highly recommend people looking to do editing, photoshop work, or even as basic as watching movies.",5
Picture quality is excellent. But LG monitors seem to have some design flaw. Not just this monitor but many other models from LG are suffering from the red corners issue (see attached picture). Better stay away from LG external monitors.,2
All the way very good moniter but most expensive when ever a 43inh4k tv is cheaper ...its a ips panel but screen bleeding is issue i place a replacement for my moniter due to it may b its on my moniter i notice some bright area in dark mode the bottom are glow more ... Same problem in replacement to . so finally returned it....,4
"Nice monitor.

Caution:
HDMI1 PORT 1 SUPPORTS ONLY 30HZ
USE HDMI2 OR PORT 2",4
"This is not ideal for gaming as it stutters at random above 30FPS.

For 4k Video editing, this is good. Configured it for Adobe media production, Corel and Sony Vegas. It takes a little time to set up as it doesn't just work out of the box. Had to play with the settings for days before finding something that worked.",4
"Very satisfied with the price and the quality if LG Monitor. Its 2k or QHD quality Monitor, gives a good experience. I got for around 21k rupees. Worth a buy.",5
I am a laparoscopic surgeon and using this for my surgeries. I am very happy with this monitor. Its picture quality is better than some of medical grade monitor which costs in lakhs. Thank u so much,5
"This 27"" 4K LG monitor is gorgeous. Rich input, HDR 10 support, design is cool. Very bright, crisp and clear. Has a lot of settings so you can please yourself. For its price I really can't imagine a better pick for an all purpose monitor. It does everything: productivity, designing, movies, gaming, coding, netflix. Highly recommend it.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I just purchase this beast for video editing on Adobe Premiere Pro and its just really awsome. sRGB & IPS panel is just wow.
Not playing game on it but 32inch display full fill my all requirements.",5
Bad quality of stands and shaking the display too much. There is no pixel perfection in images. Just a big display with lack of features. Amazon packaging is worst.,1
"Pros-
-2018 model
-IPS Panel, colours are very vibrant.
- LG india website says the MRP is 44000/- I got it at 41999 which was ok.
-A breeze to setup and calibrate.

Cons-
-Its heavy.",5
"Bought this monitor on 8th Feb 2021 for Trading and Gaming purpose. The color accuracy is amazing. HDR is a + point while watching HDR content or gaming.

This LG 27QN600 supports AMD Free Sync and is G-Sync Compatible.

Overall a must buy for those looking for a great monitor under 22k.",5
It is an old monitor at this point but it provides the basic needs for a good colour at the 2K resolution. Build quality is fine but a bit more flexibility in tilting or moving the monitor would have been appreciated. Not really meant for gaming but it gets the job done.,4
"Bought the monitor last weekend. My first big purchase after the lockdown kicked in. I couldn't be happier. It does what it promises. I had some issues connecting my Macbook Pro to this monitor and output at 60Hz, but finally found a USB-C to display cable that did the trick. The monitor comes with a sturdy stand and a screen that rotates 90 degrees, both of them were important features clubbed with 4k @ 60Hz for me.",5
The display manage button is not very responsive and with 21K range they should provide the Mic camera and small speakers. Apart from this it should also come with 3.5mm jack cable which is missing. HDMI is also only one.,3
Sit in a dark room and go for it..perfect colors...Windows support for HDR is unstable....Xbox one X HDR works fine with this monitor...Baki sab bhadiya hey...bleeding wagre ka kuch zyada issue nahi hey,5
"Great picture quality, using it for office work so couldn't comment on gaming experience.",5
"I'm using it with my Macbook pro-2019 model and running 4k@60Hz. Had to buy an external display port to USB-C connector to make it work on 60Hz with my MacBook. Some IPS bleeding on the corners but not a deal-breaker since it's visible only on full black screens and it's not as bad. Perfect display for coding, text looks crisp!",4
Very Good product.. but bit expensive and it should have backside ports should have been horizontal input to wall than vertically .. causing extra space need between monitor and wall for wall mount.,4
I don‚Äôt know much about the technical attributes but coming from a 19‚Äù DVI-D monitor I would say that it kicks some serious ass. Totally worth the money and the effort to assemble(which is almost negligible). I recommend it 100%,5
"Monitor that I received had so much back light bleeding disappointed...
Please ensure you don't get a defective product I am returning mine since replacement option is not available ....
I think this monitor is good it's just that this one is a defective product ....",3
Like the picture quality. Three sides bezel less. Multiple picture modes to help you select necessary for the current work whether you are watching movie or reading PDF etc.,5
"I'm using this as an extension monitor to my MacBook Pro, it works absolutely fine. The reviews about bezels leaks made a little worried but they, I don't know why people are expecting this to be an AMOLED type display, there are absolutely no bezel leaks on a black screen and only a little leak can be seen when it shows No signal (which is expected).

Update (9 Month after purchase): Everything is same, no bezel leaks.",5
Within 12 months of purchasing this the corners started bleeding red after a couple of hours of operation. Not worth. Do not waste your money here. Google for reviews of this monitor and you fill find lot of customers complaining of red corners. I did the mistake of not doing a thorough search before buying this.,1
"Looks amazing on the desk. Only thing I would love to have extra are the speakers and maybe a USB C port. It's best in the range.
I had an issue while playing fifa with my ps3 and up till now I have only noticed this in fifa. It forms different colour swatches around the player while they are moving.",4
"This monitor no longer power up and looks to be dead, very disappointing and I never gone put my trust on LG again for sure. Few months ago Display port stopped working no matter what different cable you try it did not work I gave up. was using HDMI after display port failure now will have to give on LG.",1
"Great monitor for picture quality and PS4 gaming. But after months of use, top left and right edge have burnt out for some reason.",3
Hdr10 is misleading.. do not buy this for hdr. There is only hdr effect which is not exactly hdr,1
"Best budget 2k all round monitor, HDR video looks great, 75Hz refresh rate good for most of games",5
"it's a nice product, value for money. i am using it for editing purpose picture quality is too good. but it had a problem that it's not connected with my laptop but working with my CPU if it connects with my laptop defiantly i Will give it 5 starts, after using 5 days i have only this issue with it. otherwise it's a good product.

go for it!!",4
"It's good in colurs good for editing n for gaming but u need a good Graphics card to make 100% use of this Monitor
Front side is black colour back side White
DP-IN Port is there which is very good
HDMI port
Adapter type power pin .
U will get CD
Overall it's good .",4
I have moved away from Samsung because every Samsung product i had not lasted more than 4 years. This monitor is just perfect for my work and gaming. I saw that the panel developed a green tint after two years and got a new panel free of cost from LG amazing support from LG.,5
"I was sceptical if I should go with 32‚Äù 2K or 27‚Äù 4k. After so many review I settled with 32‚Äù.

I‚Äôm a software developer and I‚Äôm very satisfied with my decision. No led bleeding and the texts are crisp.",5
Brilliant Monitor. I use this for photo and video editing. The colours and clarity is calibrated to perfection. The only negative is that there are no USB ports and there is no ON/OFF button (like on all Dell Monitors).,5
This is a very good product. But if you are planning to come etc with apple laptop order the usb type c version. Else this is a good product .,3
Monitor has a little bit IPS glow but that doesn't affect actual picure quality. Colors and picture quality are absolutely stunning :),5
I am glad I didn't step back due to few negative ratings. these Monitors are awesome!,5
Its a great Monitor....but its been 9 months now and I've started noticing red corners.... backlight bleed it seems...have called customer care... hopefully i get my issue sorted,1
"Good monitor for 3d content creation. Nove brightness and contrast level. Beautiful design.
Struggled for few mins to find the power button.

Overall a good product, thought bit expensive.",4
"Excellent for content creation colour accurate IPS display is amazing for watching movies.
4k content can amaze you on this monitor.",5
Five month review: Good packaging. No issues thus far,5
"I mostly use it for the work. The 4k gives the amazing workspace which is not present in HD monitors of this size. The picture quality is amazing. For watching 2.7k or 4k videos the laptop or the CPU connected should have a very good ram and graphics support. Overall, like this product.",5
"There was a lot of backlight bleed in this monitor, and when I tried to get it replaced the option wasn't available so I had to return it no doubt the display looked good but when it came to dark scenes in movies or games it was there and was pretty annoying.",2
"Writing this review after using it for a week. My first ever 4k monitor. Bought it for playing PS4 games. Would say the best under 35k budget. First thing i did was the dead pixel test, found no dead pixels. Thanks to the seller. Display looks good. Colors get washed here and there at times, but shldnt be much of a problem in the long run.",4
I purchased this device recently and within a couple of days of usage it started getting black like this. Worst product ever.,1
Great color accuracy out of the box. Hdr support is awesome. Although a bit more expensive than other 4k monitors but worth every penny for professional work.,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Great picture quality and brightness turn off hdr for gaming. Watch movies on 1440p and play games on 1980*1080p 75hz.everything is good I got a non defective piece. Text is very crisp go for programming, movies and moderate gaming.",5
Just fantastic quality of image and the hydraulic feeling tilt and height adjustment is fab. I especially like the Matt finish on the screen.,5
"This monitor is good for my work, I love its colours, vividness, contrast. It has beautiful panel, a solid built really solid, beautiful design of outer body.",5
"After 1 month of usage weird sound started to come from the monitor , unable to find out the cause. although the monitor picture quality is good but worried about this sound and durability.",2
Love the display. Crisp picture quality. Some people have conplained bleeding. I don't see any. Go ahead and buy.,5
"Using for last 2 months,till now no problem,no defect at all,working well.good delivery & service by amazon.",5
"Excellent build quality. Great picture quality. Only downside is the price. Should be in the range of 25,000/-",4
Picture quality is not good as it should be. I have one BenQ monitor and that is much better than this,3
"No USB C port for this price. On PS4 HDR, monitor blinks... (not sure if it‚Äôs PS4 or monitor). Flimsy bezel quality. Blacks are really bad.",3
Awesome display and accurate colours. Only the missing thing is remote to adjust the brightness or other modes. You need to use the single physical button. Otherwise it has perfect screen size and quantity for office work and watching multimedia.,5
Very nice product for normal daily use. Didn't try for gaming,5
"Good Monitor for Creative Work ,not the best but good according to price point.
Made a Good point in Gaming Segment.",5
"I submitted a review by mistake.
I apologise.
I should have measured diagonally not horizontally. Foolish mistake.
Thanks",1
Great 4K monitor. Use this as a screen for my 2019 Mac Pro & works like a charm. Only thing - it doesn‚Äôt have a speaker. Else a great piece!,5
No second thought and go for it. Gamers and Designers would love it for sure. My review after almost 1.5 years of usage.,5
Overall a good package. The only drawback for me was unadjustable height of the stand.,3
"Awesome product, picture quality is very good!
Screen is bright enought for my use. I am using it for daily work, entertainment and little bit of XBOX gaming purpose.",5
"So I've connected the monitor and downloaded the software from their website and installed it. It prompted me to restart but now my PC is not turning on, just a blank screen. Can anyone help me out?",3
I bought two of these and I love the dual monitor setup. The colors are amazing.,5
I was so excited to try out my new monitor but all the excitement went to vain when my monitor could not turn on...Please check your monitor as soon as it is monitored and hold your happiness until u see the display on your monitor,1
"It's good. It's been a month, I am happy so far.",5
"A must have WFH setup in present scenario, I am a UX Designer and it gives me extra space to design prototypes, wireframes and increase productivity. Highly recommended.",4

Light bleeding is there,5
"Don't purchase this monitor.
I am seeing a green dot in middle of the screen.
Its not even 20 days.",1
Light bleeding is a serious problem in this monitor. Apart from that it's an outstanding product in this price point. If back light bleeding is not an issue for you then you can surely go for it.,4
"I'm so happy with it. The resolution, colour production, design, etc. are top notch. Thank you LG and Amazon.",5
It's been a nightmare trying to return this defective product. It's been over a month now and Amazon India still says they are another 5 days out. But they say that every time I call. Very frustrating,1
Graphics are excellent. Price-wise this is very good and affordable 4K display panel. Still could not get 60hz on 4K simply because I need a converter soon.,5
Good quality for regular use,5

"Speakers in the monitor is not working

I had double checked it",2
Best gaming monitor in 4k as I can say I use it on PS4 pro and the picture quality is amazing and HDR10 support as well not full HDR but it does the job overall 9/10. 1 point cut due to it's heavyweight.,5
"Monitor was superb but mine one was defective there was some gap between screen and body at thew bottom ..
the quality was best",5
"No Defective product for me and it's easy to install ... For me, it's an amazing product :-)",5

Amazing monitor,5
This ips panel is very sharp and have very good colour profile . With my MacBook m1 it's working fine . Highly recommend for photo and video editing.,5

"Very Good Monitor , i am satisfied",5
"My primary use of monitor is going to be for office work.
I found Its eye safe not as good as Samsung.",4
You will see lighter corners on the screen due to bad viewing angles. The screen has a colour cast along the bottom edge.,3
The product delivers to the promised specs. IPS glows are not to be confused with color bleed,4
"Great 4k monitor at this price range, fully satisfied with the performance.",5
The product is good. We have all office monitors of the same brands as the initial results are good. I am specially happy with the delivery services.,4
There is no quality check at all. There is a dead pixel right at the center of the screen.,1
Perfect for me. Not a hardcore gamer and picture quality is above the mark,5
Panel has ips glow which irritate me and force me to return this device,1
"It's a good monitor, however they could have provided a remote to manage it as it has the capability to be used with FireStick.

Everything else is best",4

Lower quality price high,1
The one I received has slight ips bleeding. So make sure you check for IPS bleeding when you get a new one.,4
This is an awesome monitor and has a lot of modes. Each mode has it's own display configurations and suite various purposes. HDR effect is good and 4K videos feel lifelike.,5
Its' better than the macbook pro's retina display. I'm using 2 of these with my macbook pro 16.,5
Using it for a month now for office work. No issues at all. Very good product.,5

"Very good monitor and adjusting height is simple, perfect for my adjusting desk. Resolution is amazing and minimal bleed from corners. The price at 40k is high and that is the only negative!",5
"Was using a Dell FullHD Monitor with my base PS4 Previously (ever since I got the base PS4 in Oct 2014)

A TV would have been much cheaper but I've always been a Console+Monitor gamer so this was perfect for my need and viewing distance (less than 1 feet). Easily the best display I've ever used, first I connected my 2017 Macbook Air to check the 4K, MBA with this monitor makes the normal MBA screen look like GameBoy Advance.

Really flawless monitor, I was really not expecting this big of a difference but Spiderman Running on Pro & This Monitor IS INSANELY BETTER than FullHD Base PS4 Spiderman :P The 4K Monitor jump weirdly feels even bigger than a jump from say a 40inch 1080p TV to 40inch 4K TV. Mainly due to fact that the low viewing distance with monitors amplifies every little detail, good or bad. But yeah, Amazing jump. Truly surpassed my exceptions, even using a game like Spidey as example that runs from 50-70% of 4K. What is increasing the overall picture quality so much (almost 2 or 3 times better) apart from the resolution bump is HDR. Monitor switches to HDR seamlessly, even has a really good HDR emulation setting for NonHDR stuff. Although when the title does support HDR, you don't have to do anything and the monitor does the switch automatically.

The GAME modes of this monitor are insanely well calibrated and so so refined. It's pretty amazing how well calibrated the default settings of this monitor are.

Monitor even has freesync, only xbox one X supports it though. I hope ps5 uses this too, at least that way the monitor will be useful even in next gen when we actually see even more True4K console games.",5
"it is stated as having HDR 10 in the amazon page but only has a brightness of 350 nits, this is misinformation bordering on fraud. Remove this HDR 10 tag immediately",2
blacks are not as good as i thought. refresh rate is low it must have been 120hz but it is vey slow. when i pkay pc games screen flickering occurs. causing me to dwngrade graphics content to match screen refresh rate,3
"Have been using LG27UK650 for a week now. Bought this to go with Macbook Air Early 2015. The handshake has been seamless; the monitor was recognized instantly upon plugging in the mini DP to DP cable completely utilizing the 4K UHD capabilities of my mac. HDR 'emulation' is a bit let down on normal source; it spoils the image actually. Perhaps it will work better with actual HDR source. Haven't had the opportunity to test AMD freesync; not a gamer anyway. I am comfortable to use it in photo mode that limits any 'grainy' perceptions. 60hz is adequate for day to day work; no eye strains so far. Overall I am impressed with the vast increase in the screen real estate depicting vibrant, yet believable colours. The menu buttons are intuitive and easy to use. It sits very pretty on the table with nice contours. Bought it for 40k from a different source when Amazon was selling it at 42k. Highly recommended.",4
"Let's keep aside the pricing for this review! But, anything less than 28k would be a reasonable price, in my honest opinion.

Features and Pros:
1. Quad HD
2. LG IPS Panel
3. 32"" and 1440p is a reasonable combination
4. Pricing with discounts during sales. (25k-28k)

Cons:
1. On a case by case basis you might receive a panel with bleeding, go for replacement or refund.
2. It's a new class of monitors in terms of pricing and feature set.
3. HDR10 is a just at certification level, not among the most fabulous HDR10 panels.",5
"One of the best monitors I have ever seen. I have bought this for my Xbox One X and games look great on HDR. People seem to point out this is not a true HDR since this has only 450 nits of peak brightness ,but true hdrs atleast cost close to 1.5 lakhs and the peak brightness it has is better for monitor because we sit very close to it. I have seen picture quality of LG Oled since I own one and this monitor is by far better bang for the buck.",5
"Pro: it is lg. That's it.
Cons: the stand is fix n it cannot move so the screen is at a higher elevation n hence one may not be able to see the full screen.
2. The bezels are thick , it is poor Marketing by lg where they are missleading the customer saying boderless. It has thick inbuilt screen borders. It ruins.
3. Hdr is sub-par and it over saturates to yellowish tone. Not good.
4. It is 8 bit monitor with oversampling to 10bit to go into HDR10. Hence not good colour accuracy.
5. Not exactly 75hz, but 74.97hz. not ideal for gaming.
6. Amazon is selling it lot higher than you might get at a local store.",2
"This is one good large monitor. No screen bleeding though there are glitches on Linux but with few tweaks in the video card it is working smooth. I am a developper and this monitor helps me as I could open multiple windows. Will give full review after 2 months.

Note: if you use hdmi it always asks you to keep the refresh rate to 60hz.",3
"I received the monitor and was surprised to see that there is an uneven gap between the border and the display(who is to blame here?). The backlight bleed is considerably large and out of the box and also the yellow tint is brighter/equal to the ips glow which is at the bottom. Not expected from apprio retail and from Amazon. Highly disappointed.

This has also become a trend among the sellers in India they will repack the received replaced/returned product and advertise them as new and when you open the received box it turns out to be a repacked product and not original.",1
"Its a really great upgrade if you are coming from a full HD monitor.
Its a gorgeous display.
The texts and icons are so crisp and clear.
Stand is sturdy and heavy.
If you are going to use it with Macbook Pro, then you will notice it immediately that it is if not better then at par with retina display.
I have bought it offline!
I have been using with both Windows 10 and MacOs and both look fantastic.

4.5/5 Overall.",5
"I ordered this thinking it's a QHD resolution monitor,but this is just another stupid FHD monitor! It's built quality is ridiculous and has massive flexes...I have ordered a refund! This costs around 15k but I paid 28k....",1
Dont buy not a good monitor.,1
Decent screen. Easy controls. However sound has never worked. Height adjustment is useful and image quality is great for day to day work. Refresh rate could be better for gaming.,4
"Bought it from local store. Here are the reason why u should get it:
-Factory calibrated
-99% srgb
-high bit rate
-ips panel
And its the only good 4k monitor available in india for fair price.",5
very expensive in the term of feature only 350 nits if it says it has hdr so this feature is waste,1
"Pls don't Buy this monitor.There is huge issue with black light bleed. I have 27ud68p model. I purchased it in 2017, within 1 year RED areas began to appear around edges. LG got me a replacement but again after 9 months same thing happened.",1
"Been using this since 2 months.
Bought it from the local market and got it slightly cheaper.
I use it mostly for my video editing work.
It gives great sharpness and color accuracy at 4k.
Second usage is for media consumption and gaming.
Overall great product for its price range.",5
"This monitor is gud for watching movies, working, editing nd all
if u are a gamer...pls don't buy this..and it lags..nd 75hz refresh rate is not good for this",3
"Picture quality and brightness for gaming is excellent. No lag while playing game. This is the best monitor in this price range.
No backlight bleeding issue.",5
"If you looking for 27 inch 2k ips panel for editing under 20000 then go for it ,make sure you get under deal .",4
Used HDMI to connect. Great brightness at this price range (22.5k). Highly recommended. Looks decent. Plastic body is highly good.,5
Bad,1
"As 4k monitors go, LG has a decent monitor here. Not the best, not the worst. But the panel quality could certainly have been better. I got a product with strong green tinge and bleeding at bottom half of screen, so I requested a replacement which I promptly got. However, after a few weeks, same problem arose with the replacement as well. Strong green tinge at bottom left and right corners which becomes very obvious in dark scenes and pictures. In bright display, it is not noticeable.
Major facts that I have observed till now:
1. It heats up a bit in bottom half as well. It is quite perceptible difference in temperature between top half and bottom half which you can feel at the side edges of the monitor.
2. Strong bleeding at bottom right and left corners to green tinting, especially in dark scenes it is quite evident.
3. Does have 2 HDMI ports and 1 display port. One more display port would have been a plus.
4. Does have audio output port.
5. Had great vertical adjustment, you can tilt monitor full 90 degrees from landscape to portrait, but no swivel option.
6. 60 Hz refresh rate at 4k quality.
7. Is fully G-sync compatible though N-Vidia doesn't list it as so and works perfectly via display port with g-sync/N-Vidia card in my setup (1660Ti)

All is all, Amazon service and Appario are top notch service providers till now. Delivery is great. Packing was superb, replacement was super quick as well. However,, I am sure you can find a better 4k monitor if your budget will allow you to go just a bit higher. The green tint and light bleeding does interfere with quality.",4
Everything was good just the piece i got has a manufacturing defect and that was the last piece in stock otherwise i will definetly buy that no doubt.,5
"Great Monitor for the price
Nice Viewing angle
Pre caliberated
good colours",5
"Everything is fine about the display,but could find some edge bleeding ,and since it's ips really good viewing angles and they provide both diplsay port and hdmi which is great ,but it would have been better if there was height adjustable,or offer a model with one.",5
"I bought it on a sale after saving up money only to get a damaged monitor used by someone else. After weeks of wasting my time and now another week to return and refund, I get nothing back. This was a pathetic experience and amazon does not want to be responsible in anyway.
The monitor itself was good and I will buy this one properly at a local store, albeit at a higher price. I lost my trust on Amazon after 5 years. Will update the review again in the future if any changes are made

Edit 1: They took the monitor back and offered a refund but they didnt do a replacement like I asked. Immediately after I returned it, the deal was again active with a single piece! It seems they resold the used monitor they sent to me as new again to someone else!!",1
"This is a very good 4k monitor from LG and for me it ticks all the boxes to be a great buy.

PROS -

1). Very bright (can reach upto 400 nits)
2). On screen software is nice to control your monitor settings without using physical buttons .
3). LG IPS panel -Colors are brilliant on this ips panel.
4). Very minimal backlight bleed - Even though this is an ips panel the blacklight bleed is bare minimum.
5). Design - very thin bezels gives you an immersive feel and stand is quite sturdy and very adjustable.

I also think it lacks few things that I noticed.

CONS -

1). It lacks Swivel movement , so you have to move whole monitor with stand in your direction.
2). HDR is not that effective .
3). Even when I adjust its stand‚Äôs height to minimum, the monitor still feels to be placed at a high position .

Also it was a great value for money at 28700/- effective price during Great Indian sale.",5
"I simply loved this monitor. Before I had LG 27uk850 which is a bad monitor and had light bleeding issues so I had returned that monitor. But now this monitor is beautiful and I am using it with my MacBook Pro and with imac also. Yes it's not upto the level of MacBook Pro or IMac retina screens but still it gives very good output with MacBook Pro.

I have not purchased the USB c version because don't want to charge my MacBook Pro from usb c cable which I think 60w and can damage your MacBook Pro in future with regular charges so I opted for this model and using the display port ( have to purchased it separately) and charging my laptop with the original power adapter by Apple.

Cables: The HDMI cable and display port cable which comes with the monitor have no use. They don't give the 60htz output and gives only 30htz which is laggy. So you have to purchase the proper 60htz cables. LG should provide the good quality cables which is the negative point of any Lg monitors.

Light Bleeding: I am lucky that I didn't get any bleeding issues with this monitor but yes IPS glow is there which is a common thing with all IPS panels. Remember light bleeding and IPS Glow both are separate things because some people count IPS glow as bleeding issue.

Monitor Stand. I don't like the stand ( which is a personal choice ) which came with it. Cant even move it to different positing properly so I have purchased the gas arm stand which is very smooth and your desk looks very clean with it.

Overall I am very satisfied with the monitor.",5
"Pros
- Screen is really good
- Feels Premium
- Height adjustable
- Split screen also works download the driver from lg.com for this model. Pretty sweet feature.
- On screen screen function also works by downloading driver from lg.com

Cons-
On 4K resolution everything becomes so small it is not readable. I know this is the thing with every 4K monitor out there. So most of the time I keep the resolution at 2k for better readability.
No in speaker
No USB port",5
"I am totally satisfied with this monitor.
The HDR isn't as pronounced as they say because it's HDR 400. But the the monitor has consistent colors and great color accuracy. The stand is very sturdy and has appropriate weight when doing all types of adjustments. It's a great stand after all. I would say unless you plan to buy a separate monitor stand, buying this UL650 model is highly recommended over the standard UL600 model of this monitor. Because the stand is well worth the money. The only complaint would be that it doesn't swivel left or right. But it can do literally every other movement we'll ever need.

Let's talk about the overall build quality, it's just great. The vesa mount is very satisfying to use. The overall body of the monitor is made of good quality plastics. The white color looks really good.

It comes with 1x HDMI cable, 1x Display Port Cable and a CD. The CD was not packed properly it was just thrown inside the box along with the warranty papers. I couldn't find the software to install that will make things even better. When searched on LG website it shows no software available for this monitor model. Or when I found one, the download link didn't work.

Anyways, this is a great monitor and is well worth the money. 4K looks stunning. Unfortunately my laptop isn't very powerful to run 4k60 smoothly. I'll be using this monitor with my new PC build that is coming soon. Until then I'll be using it in 2K 60hz mode.

It still looks great in 2K 60Hz.
27 inches might be a bit too big for many but as a video editor, I find more space adding upto the convenience. You could go with the 24 inch ones but I couldn't find a good 24 inch 4k monitor that is color accurate and has good reviews.

Also 27 inches seem to be the sweet spot for monitor size especially for productivity and it looks like 27 inches is a standard size.

The colors are very vibrant and has many color settings presets.
Straight out of the box everything looks stunning. And the display is matte so you don't have to deal with reflections.

It is an overall great monitor with great value for money.
One complaint I would say is that the headphone jack in the back of the monitor is flimsy and not of good quality. It sounds bad when the headphone is connected to that port. It sounds excellent when I connect directly to my laptop.
So I wouldn't use that headphone jack. Anyway it's just a small thing.

If you want pure audio quality don't use that headphone jack.
If you want pure picture quality this is the monitor to go at this price range.

I'm very happy that I chose this.
I will update the review if something goes wrong in the future.",5
"I am being honest in what i write here.... there really isn‚Äôt, literally, anything else in the market like this monitor at this price if you really have the need for it. Ultra gaming is a given but need for content creation is also way above average. This product from LG really is a masterpiece for this price. I love it entirely.",5
"a nice monitor, good colors, hdr works when connected to macbook 16inch, no visible back light bleeds. overall happy with the purchase.",5
"After spending a 10 days of doing extensive research, I bought this LG computer monitor for coding, and love the clarity. text look crisp and clear. It's reader mode is fantastic for working for long hours, as I spend 8-9 hours per day for office work and 0% strain to eyes. Some of it's unique features such as pivot, dual controller, and screen split makes you productive and the coding work easy.",4
Not a gamer. Mainly for work from home office work. Connected to HP laptop. Very simple installation. Texts are clear in documents and no distortions. Color looks pretty. The up/down movement is really useful to get the height right. Just push monitor up or down to adjust height. Not a bezel less but looks good.,5
"Pros:
Excellent Panel.
Accurate and vibrant colors.
Can get really bright.
Good Black levels.
The stand provided is really nice.

Cons:

Wobbles a bit if the surface shakes.
Price is slightly on the higher side for the the features.

One would atleast expect a USB C at this price point bit it doesn't have one. It's available in UL850 which is 10k more than this model.

Irrespective of what the description shows, it DOESN NOT have a USC C port. I was aware of it before buying but the images are a bit misleading.",4
It's a good 4k monitor for the price. HDR is there just for the records but couldn't expect more for the given price range. Overall it's a great monitor for 4k video editing and movie watching. Currently using it with Dell XPS 15.,5
"1- I first plugged it to my XBox despite knowing that it 60Hz display
2- Played a 4K video that has lot of green snake (by this time every 4k enthusiast has seen that over and over)
- Absolutely stunning results gorgeous looking display (using the in box provided HDMI cable)
- Provided HDMI cable is capable of rendering 4K at 60Hz when used with Xbox
3- Tried playing NFS, XBox detected a 4K display and wanted to enable special feature, went ahead do it
- It's good but not really meant for gaming, for more than one reason
- For gaming a full HD TV with 100Hz refresh rates is more than enough for not to gamer (a Full HD TV would be more value for money if sole objective is to play games )
4- Plugged in to Linux laptop using provided HDMI cable (TypeC->Hub->HDMI->Monitor)
- First impressions
1. Nice display
2. 4K is stuck at 30Hz
3. Everything has lot of whitespace all of a sudden and everything looked very tiny
4. 60Hz with one lower setting was best in this case
5- Plugged into my windows laptop that already handle 4K like a pro
- First impressions
1. Flawless, colors perfect, scaling perfect
2. With HDMI the refresh rate is still stuck with 30Hz (not bad, can live with it but that's not one wants)
Display port cable in my opinion is as waste as the CD provided, as most of the HUB and laptops won't have display port. That cable has display port on both ends what a bummer and wasteful asset

I have ordered a 60Hz type-c to HDMI cable, shall update if I can get 4K @ 60Hz with that. (Works)

Nothing wrong with provided HDMI cable but your HDMI port in hub or laptop might be capped at 4k@60Hz so get the right cable accordingly.

Very good for reading comfort and watching videos.

It would be much helpful if type-c to HDMI or Display port cable is included in box",4
They boosted the price to 30k and sold at 29k saying it‚Äôs an offer. But after I bought it. It became ‚Çπ28k. That‚Äôs the price of this product.,1
"I really love the monitor. It is best one you can get with incredible features like 4k, vesa mount, adjustable stand, 27inch.

Only problem is that it doesn't have usb c. There is another model which comes with it but it is 10k more and i feel not worth it. I right now use usb to hdmi convertor with my laptop.",5
"It‚Äôs a good monitor from LG. 4K resolution with 27 inch size is a good combination to go for. The text appears very clear, colours are also good while using with Mac OS. Thankfully, there is no backlight bleeding in the monitor I received but it has typical IPS glow.

Few cons: HDR does not seem to be working as expected with Mac. Packaging and built quality of the panel could be better. In this price LG could give slimmer bezels.

Overall good monitor for productivity and multitasking during work from home. I got it for 27K in sale so it‚Äôs ok.",5
A huge and intense Backlight bleeding on the corner that is even visible when doing some task on screen...and degrade the viewing experience......please note we are spending 30k just for display,1
"Very good 4k monitor but Hdr is useless.. I have connected to Macbook Pro 16 inch the colors are washed out..

But everything else expect for Hdr is just perfect... üëåüëåüëå",4
"I purchased for photo editing in photoshop. Its just great looking, 4K is awesome, stand is so flexible, I have absolute no issues with monitor , worked just perfectly with my MacBook Air, I had to purchase a Thunderbolt to Display port cable though. By default it comes with 1 HDMI cable, 1 Display Port Cable",5
"This is an amazing product for those who are looking for color accuracy. Amazing quality. Preferred over other brands, LG is slightly costly but delivers the value.

Go for it.",5
Great picture quality and great features,5
"White Spot on Display, Used product sent to me. There was already 1 hr or up time on the monitor.",1
Not happy... Had to get the screen replaced just after one week of getting it due to ghosting issue and even the second screen has the same problem waiting for serving replacement. Pretty sure I was sent a refurbished item for the price of brand new.,1
"Using with my Xbox One X...amazing quality...Also using as my PC monitor..No complaint whatsoever. If you need an ideal 27"" monitor, this is the one.",5
Good monitor. I'm using it for my design use. One thing I found as an issue is that enabling HDR changes the colours a lot. So I'm using with it turned off. Other than that it is a good display.,5
True VESA certified 4K HDR 400 Monitor..Excellent quality clear and brighter picture with good features overall i am very happy.. LG did a good jobüëç,4
A very perfect and beautiful display screen. All good but but no speaker . May be a small built in speaker could have been better . Just love it on Play Station .,5
Monitor is average. Refresh rate is stuck at 30Hz with Windows 10 Laptop and with MacBook Pro. Techsupport has no clue on it yet,2
Every thing is fine but after using for few months I am noticing a screen burn issue even for 10 to15min static image. And this burn is noticeable on grey colour.,1
"Detailed in pixels, Comfortable stand

Worth for each rupee",5
Great monitor to pair with my MacBook Pro - have been using it for work and no complaints so far. Make sure you have a 4K 30/60 fps compatible cable or adapter - otherwise you‚Äôll see some quality loss.,5
"Monitor is very good. It is helping me as expected. Only problem I see is that when Mac goes to sleep mode and comes back, monitor turns complete yellow. I need to disconnect n connect back to get back normal.",5
The monitor condition is good and renders 4k as expected but somehow my Macbook pro 2019 becomes so slow and literally unusable after sometime. Not sure if issue is with the monitor or the display cord or the laptop.,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Picture quality is great, Inbuilt speaker missing.
Worth buying , i bought this for Rs 29,999.",5
Perfect for my Photo Editing Jobs,5
"No swivel function

Otherwise fine",3
Only missisng thing: It doesn't swivel.,5
Superb product. Just go for it,5
Excellent colour,5
Love it! No issues. Best 4K Monitor!,5

Very good monitor,5
Build quality nd matte display is very good,5
amazing quality,5
"This monitor has only 60Hz of refresh rate and has price 28k
I will suggest to buy acer gaming monitor instead of this because they have 145Hz refresh rate and comes in only 17k",1

"Text is clear and sharp (thx to 4k)

Cons for me :-
My Pc only have hdmi 1.4 which means 4k@30hz which sucks.
(But not a problem with right hdmi version ,üòÉ)
Display port is useless in my side.
My product has a slight bent on the hydraulic stand but it's not a big issue (may be due to movement during shipping).
Over all best for those who are searching for 4k, best colors,Good standard and build quality,and for multitasker ,(can also be a option for gaming of u are fine with 60hz)",5
"due to COVID - 19 my office instructed to WFH for few weeks and I need an office like setup at home for my busy workday. Bought couple of these monitors and an Amazon Basics dual monitor stand for mounting these monitors. The whole setup compliments my office desk.

Pros:
- Matty finish (good for programming / development use)
- 75Hz refresh rate
- LED backlight (night time you can some light bleeding, but during day time / under proper light no difference)
- VA Panel (no details about VA / IPS panel either in the documentation or Samsung website)
- Colour reproduction is awesome
- Mount option available
- Frameless Design (looks great)

Cons:
- No Audio out port (as mentioned by others). You can't use it for other use cases (like tv)
- Limited connectivity options (no DVI / DisplayLink port), only HDMI or VGA
- VGA resolution is not good when on MAC (I tested Mac Book Pro only, don't know about others). HDMI is recommended

Need to check the durability.",4
"Got this monitor after going through almost a week of research. Wanted to buy the LG 24"" as the Samsung curved one has a VA panel and I have seen it, the colors were not that great in that one but at the last moment I saw this from Samsung. My expectations were high from Samsung and it did match my expectations.
Pros:
1. Color are vibrant and pictures are sharp.
2. Blacks are blacks, as good as a LED monitor can reproduce black. In day time it feels like an OLED black, at night you can see a bit of light as its an LED, but its really good keeping in mind that it's an LED panel.
3. The 75hz refresh rate makes it feel a bit snappier than regular 60hz monitors.
4. The thin bezels gives it a modern look.
Cons:
1. The stand is not adjustable, I didn't expect it to have adjust hight option, but at least adjusting the inclination angle option should be there for an monitor.

But it's a great buy at this price point. I got it for 9999. You can go for it. Everything else is really good in this one.

Edit: after using it for 6 months, I am impressed with the picture quality and colour reproduction. I didn't face any issues till date. I was so impressed that I got another one to have dual monitor setup :).",5
This is one of the best displays that I've came across at this price range. The only problem is that you cannot adjust height of the display like most monitors.,4
"CONS (only 2):

1.
Viewing Angles are NOT OK.

Of course it is not an IPS panel. If it's an IPS, there will be a clear logo. There is no mention of the same on official product specs either. It could be a PLS panel.

2.
Gaming modes: 75 hz. Useless, just marketing. No difference at all. Note: My testing was based on a dedicated graphics card with appropriate settings. Max output was 72 hz. Beyond that, screen will blankout, become non compatible. However, you will not find any difference compared to 60hz and 75hz. Maybe you will see a difference if you place the panel under a microscope or some highend slow motion camera purely for purpose of panel testing. Its just a marketing myth (irrespective of brands). You can find significant difference from144hz onwards.

PROs:

NO BACKLIT BLEEDING across the screen. I tested with a pitch black image file with full brightness settings and various angles in a dark room environment. So no issues at all.

Panel is matt finish, so no screen glares to an extent.

Color reproduction is very vibrant. Somewhat 70% close to HDR 400 although its not a HDR screen.

Overall Build quality, fit and finish is excellent. Very slim bezel with simple modern design and appeal.

9.5 K is an excellent price.

Package and delivery was good.",4
"Picture quality and viewing angles are awesome, frame less design looks great, but stand is not adjustable and backlight bleeding is there, replaced, and the new one also has bleeding

Edit: Returned the second one and purchased again, 3rd monitor has no backlight bleeding",5
"Neither bad , nor Good . For the price its ok . Color is faded a bit but for 10k . Its ok .
Backlight bleeding is there , but very little, can be ignored (I am picky about backlight bleeding) . I came form a TN panel, so color is obviously better but the punchyness strains the eye a lot .
Overall a nice monitor to go for . Didnt give 5 star as previously I saw a dell monitor (forgot the name) about 5 years back . That had better color but 7 ms response time which was bad .
Imp : dont go for 1080p in 27 inch monitor if you are looking for new purchase. You will see pixel . 1080p is best till 24 inch .

Update : got a dead pixle today . Thank God within return period . Dont know how long this will last .",1
Received Yellow shaded screen and got replaced thanks for that & On Amazon website on Technical Details Origin of country shown as India but on the box its not made in India its some other county.,2
Good monitor but the major issue what I've faced is unable to adjust the up & down height adjustment. Just fixed position.,2
"After reading blinding issue review. I trusted Samsung and it was my mistake. I have two monitors one is Samsung and other is Dell, but to be very Frank the samsung has worst quality. I don't know is it specific to model only. I request you do not buy this product.",1
"The product is having major backlight bleeding.
The first unit I got had little backlight at the bottom and I replaced it, and the second one I got had bleeding from all directions. it was just worst.",3
"I have been using this monitor for a week now, primarily for work and a little bit of gaming, and I am quite impressed by what it offers for the price (I got it for 8500 during prime day).

Pros:
1. Deep blacks give great contrast ratio
2. Matt finish minimizes reflections
3. Freesync and 75hz are good additions for gaming
4. Very slim bezels on 3 sides

Cons:
1. No vertical height adjustment
2. Color accuracy could be better out of the box. It is apparent in the pic where you can see the difference in green color of the leaves on the laptop screen and the monitor. But since i am not doing any color sensitive work, I found it acceptable.",5
"I think this is not a IPS display as there is no mention of IPS on the box nor in the manual and description.

After a Little bit of research i came to know that Samsung has its own version of IPS technology and it is called PLS technology which is very similar to IPS hence i got very similar image quality.

Overall inshort:
Pros:
1) Punchy Colors.
2) Contrasty image (some may not like).
3) Wide Viewing angle.
4) 75 Hz refresh rate (72Hz freesync on).
5) No Backlight Bleeding.
6) Really thin bezel for price.
7) One Joystick botton to control all features.
8) Cable hook provided in box for cable management.
9) Quite good design.
10) Blacks are quite good not best.

Cons :
1) It is little bit pixelating kinda okayish as its 24 inch but higher than 24inch it might get worse.
2) No height adjustment only tilt feature.
3) I think its not as colour accurate as IPS because image looks quite punchy maybe you have to adjust setting for accuracy.
4) No one tap button Power off as its a two step process.
5) No onscreen software control available.
6) No audio out from display.
7) Stand is glossy and matte plastic combo which is okayish.
8) Only HDMI and Sub DVI no Display port.

By the way it can be overclocked to 83Hz max and HDMI cable is provided in box.

Overall good Monitor for its price as i bought it at ‚Çπ9500.",5
"This display is classic Samsung. Contrast-y, bright and sharp. The actually frequency is 72.9 Hz whereas advertised as 75 Hz.
The picture modes are good and offers a dedicated Game Mode - where all the sliders are maxed out.
The FreeSync is a boon, it improves the ghosting observed and minimizes any screen-tearing.
The fixture is robust and looks sleep, except there is a slight screen wobble when I types at my max speed.
The cable management behind is good and the included HDMI cable is a welcome.
The bezels are stunning and movies/games look seamless.

I like the display, 9/10.",5
"I have been using a 27"" LG 4K IPS primary monitor that costs 40K+ and a cheap 20"" Samsung TN secondary monitor. The secondary monitor has been showing some signs of old age, and needed a replacement. What I wanted was an affordable monitor that had reasonable picture quality and over all build quality.

To be honest, I only expected an average performer in this monitor, and was pleasantly surprised by it's image quality. The colours are vibrant (don't expect the quality you get from a premium monitor) and it has more than enough brightness.

My premium primary monitor, while having excellent colour reproduction and pixel density suffers from shoddy quality control - I had to replace it five times in the span of 18 months due to various issues ranging from terrible backlight bleeding, colour non-uniformity and image retention. So when bought this rather cheap Samsung monitor, my expectations were not that high. But it outperformed my expectations. For the asking price, this is a steal.

The good:
1. Adequate image quality and colour reproduction. Bear in mind that it is not factory calibrated.
2. Excellent blacks - Even though Samsung says it is an IPS panel, I suspect that it is indeed a VA panel, because I have never seen an IPS panel that is able to render such deep blacks as this monitor does.
3. Really good brightness
4. Relatively lightweight
5. Almost no bezels
6. Adequate viewing angles
7. The VESA mount bracket is on level with the surface, unlike some LG monitors where the VESA screws area is depressed which would make it incompatible with some VESA mounts.
-----
* The pros listed below this point are specific to my monitor, and may not hold true for every one as these things are dependent on QC and is based on your luck.
6. Only extremely minor backlight bleeding - so minor that you'd often fail to notice it. My 40k+ LG monitor has major backlight bleeding issues. So this is a major relief for me.
7. No image retention issues
8. Excellent Black and White uniformity. Grey uniformity is only average.

Cons:
1. The included stand is of low quality. It has sharp rough edges and mold marks.
2. Tilt is very difficult to execute. You have to apply a lot of force to tilt the monitor, sometimes I felt worried that I might damage the monitor.
3. Not so great pixel density. Being only a 1080p monitor, 24"" size makes the pixels too big which force you to stay a bit farther away, otherwise the text does not look smooth. This is not a problem for watching videos or playing games.
------
* Following cons are specific to the monitor I received and other devices may not have these issues
4. Dead pixels - Mine had 5 dead pixels which were prominently around the top right corner. I wasn't bothered by those though.

NOTE:
When I first turned on the monitor I experienced some contrast related issues. The monitor was unable to render certain shades of grey and looked indistinguishable from white. It turned out that this was caused by the setting 'Black level' - mine had it set to 'Low', and once I changed it to 'Normal' the issue was gone.",4
"Pros.

1. Samsung screens doesn't need a intro. Even other mobile manufacturer's are buying screens from samsung only. So screen quality is top notchüòç.

2. It is a IPS panel, viewing angles good. Inky black. Good contrast. Great brightness. No backlight issue most important to choose this.

3. Comes with hdmi cable and power cable. No VGA anyhow I don't need that, but if you need you have to buy it separately.

4. Installation is easy and wall mountable. Planning to make it as a second tv after WFH over üòù

Cons.
Price again it is not a cons. Would have been great if it is little cheaper.

Overall great purchase and good Monitor",5
"Good monitors, I bought 2 monitors for a better dual screen experience. Although this is basil less, the black edging is significantly lower compared to the other monitors I've used at work.

The backlight bleeding is very less , Infact it's the best of what I've seen so far. (photo attached has reflection)

The viewing angles are great. I do not see much difference in color when looked at the display from the sides.
The monitor automatically selects input devices. Can be controlled in the setting menu
Over all, for 9k -10k this is a good monitor for the price range

Downside: no dvi",5
"I‚Äôd say this is a great monitor, I use it for gaming with my Nintendo switch and use it for editing photos and videos for my YouTube channel, which I have a video review on at Parikv99. Picture quality is really good and build is superb as well. Only things missing are an audio out port, but that doesn‚Äôt bother me much since I use my headphones anyway and height adjust. Great, value for money monitor that I recommend if this is your budget.",5
"This is a gorgeous monitor on this range, I bought it for my office use. It was easy to setup.

Picture quality is difficult to say, my laptop shows sky blue color but monitor shows in turquoise color. Tried all the settings, not sure there's a color problem with my hp laptop or Samsung monitor.

There's no adjustable stand but can be wall mounted - the way I wanted.",5
"Rcvd the product very fast.
Negative Things:
1. Screen Is fixed type you cant not adjust it horizontal or vertical.
2. While connecting with laptop as second screen refresh rate gets only 71.90HZ, contacted customer care, reply rcvd as extending the display across your screen and tv then you will of course experience a bit of a decrease in performance.

Only the good thing got it in 8500rs in amazon sale.",4
"A great external monitor that's just the right size for day to day office work and occasional Netflix/ Prime viewing. Was looking for a monitor to help manage working from home and the increased need for an additional monitor to help with screen share / presentation etc.

Need a little tweak to make this really great.

When this was plugged in at 1st, the text were awful and no matter what I tried to do with the settings nothing seemd to work. Finally after playing with the settings options on the monitor (not via Windows OS) figured out that setting the 'Game Mode Always On' did the trick. The text is razor sharp and smooth transition when you drag and drop windows and other apps. Most of the other settings were kept at factory setting. Monitor is very very bright at 100%. Recommended to dial it down to 20-25%. Hope this helps if you are struggling with the resolution.",5
"Excellent product. Though I am little sceptical whether it is IPS or not. Good colors, really bright for indoor, anti-glare. You will enjoy viewing it. My unit has a tiny black dot on the right side, I believe a foreign particle in between the layer. But I dont mind it. It does not have back light bleeding. Right side portion is little brighter than the left side if you are viewing black. Tilt mechanism is little weird. Otherwise really good product.",5
"12-05-2021 - Amazon delivered the monitor in one day but received defective product, upon complaint amazon expert verified the issue and initiated replacement immediately.

13-05-2021 - received replacement. Problem with this is it's not at all monitor for daily work. Even with '0' brightness i can't read a word doc for more than 5 mins. Definitely some issue with brightness. Note: i am on 75Hz. Requesting for return and Amazon acknowledged that. Thanks to Amazon

Issues -
No sharpness(looks like CRT monitor)
improper RGB balance
The LCD panel also having some issue as able to some overlighting patches in the bottom.",1
I bought this samsung S24R356FHWXXL 24 inch monitor and Its build Quality was nice. But one problem I found was its color was not accurate and giving bluish green shade. so It affects my designing work and I requested return. So as per their policy they replaced it with another monitor same model. But the problem was still there. so again returned and I gone for Benq monitor. It gave me very good color accuracy and satisfied with the result :),3
"I ordered this product on 16th of this month, I was waiting to for this very eagerly. Finally i received it today and installed, Initially i played few HD videos i liked the picture quality. Later I wanted to do my office work so i connected my laptop and then i got resolution issue i tried to resolve it but i couldn't. When i read the documents (work related word files) i found there is another issue like sharpness, i was not able to concentrate while reading. I tried to resolve the issue but i couldn't. And i finally decided to return this product, so i contacted amazon technical team, but i am not happy with their suggestions, they are asking me to use one more week, when i have made up my mind to return this product. I spoke to three people and everybody suggested the same. It was just a waste of my time and energy, because they were not giving exact solution.

I am very disappointed.",1
"Great product! Got it at Rs.9499 without any offers. Package arrived in 1 day. Eco friendly packing. Monitor has eye saver mide which is great and brightness can be increased or reduced as per comfort. Looks nice of the while and display is problem free.
I didnt see any noticable light leakage in the screen edges as some posts say. Probably its miniscule.",5
"Please think when purchasing it. This is flickering when most of the display time is in ON state. As mentioned Flicker-Free monitor, but has flicking.

And Samsung Technical agent has not proper knowledge for fix these issues.

This is my second monitor still the same issue I'm facing yet.",1
"So, my first attempt of buying this product was not good. The monitor had screen bleeding after few hours of use itself. Returned and got a replacement.
Pros:
Love the look, design and curve around the edges
No screen bleeding with the replaced monitor
Display is good
Overall happy with the price point and product.

Cons:
Stand is not adjustable
The button is on the backside which was difficult to find at first and not so great to use
Brightness level is too much even if I decrease it to a minimum, but I have got used to it now after few days.

Overall, worth to buy especially for the price compared to the competition",4
"I am Software Engg by profession was always thriving to get a bigger screen monitor, now is perfect time to maximum the useage of this perfect product from Samsung during this WFH culture.
Samsung always know for their product durability, monitor looks sturdy, good build quality, good picture quality as well. You cannot tilt or adjust monitor that‚Äôs the only where felt the disappointment which not of a major deal breaker.",5
"Ordered a unit on 3rd April, received with multiple dead pixels on it. I was not sure about the dead pixel policy but worrying that it may get worse in the future I opted for a replacement. Oh my was I in for a surprise, the replacement unit had a physical defect along with a dead pixel. Returned the 2nd unit as well, and took a refund due to ""Only one replacement policy"". Both units had Sept'20 as MFG date. Samsung needs to improve its QC or Amazon delivery guys need to handle the package with care.",1
"I thought I'd use it as a secondary, vertical monitor beside my primary 27"" WQHD IPS. I couldn't stand it.

The panel is not that great, very little headroom to tweak it to display accurate colors. Cannot even set gamma manually, just some presets. Then, the PPI is also low enough to look unpleasant. Samsung claims it's an IPS, but I suppose it barely makes the cut.

Find something better for your money.",3
Good product. No backlight bleeding issue. If you need a good quality monitor go for it. You'll not be disappointment.,5
"After checking all monitors from HP and LG in this price range, finally decided to go with this model. Major reason was the price as I got this 24 inch mod for only 8.5k during prime day sale!!!

I will divide the review between pros and cons-

Pros:
1. Cheapest 24 inch full HD IPS monitor from a premium brand
2. Picture quality is excellent, viewing angles are great as it has IPS panel
3. Bezels are almost non existent which gives a premium look
4. Setup is easy, hdmi cable is provided instead of vga which is a plus for using with most modern devices
5. Only one button operation For controlling brightness and contrast etc.
6. Cables can be arranged with the provided clip
7. No weird backlight bleeding
8. Wall mounting is possible

Cons:
1. Stand takes little extra space due to the design of it
2. Minimum brightness could have been lower
3. Tilting range is limited

If you‚Äôre deciding between this one and LG, you can go with either one as both are almost same.",5
"Its is really a good monitor in the price Range, but cant adjust the height or neither can be tilted.
Picture quality is really amazing.

The monitor I got had too much IPS glow from bottom (clearly seen in night) and had few dead pixels. so, I had to return it.

Sometimes my eyes were hurting on watching this monitor, although brightness, contract was at the minimum level.
For Dual WFH home setup, yes its good, make sure that the monitor is placed 3 feed approx from your sitting place to get a decent view and not hurt your eyes.

Rating -
Monitor Build - 7/10
Picture - 8/10
Gaming - 8/10
WFH - 7/10",3
"Text from far looks good but if you are using it upclose this won't cut it. I have a macbook pro, i think i might be spoiled by those crips display. It's not atall a bad panel but for my use case i might save up to buy a 2k or 4k panel, 1080p ain't cutting it.",3
This is a great monitor. I switched from 19.5 and this feels huge compared to that. The picture quality is very good and watching videos is an absolute delight. It also has a vesa mount for hooking it on stands or wall. Its not really thin compared to some of hp monitors at that price but it feels sturdy. But the stand takes quite a lot of space and is spread out and its overall a bit heavy,4
"Monitor color looks good.
No edge bleeds.

Monitor stand is firm, but very annoying problem it looks little bit tilted towards front side, and I cannot adjust it as it's not adjustable. But if you don't pay much attention then it doesn't bother much.

I'm going to keep this one, already returned 1 monitor for defects.

Colors looks little yellowish with default settings. I decreased RED and GREEN little bit now looks OK.

I'll post later if any problem I face later.",4
Very poor build..Ants entered inside the display within 1month..can't believe it.. very very very cheap materials used..cheap thin plastic around the display is very fragile and loose!! Is this really from samsung??!!! Or fake one?,1
"- Few portions of the package were found as opend. Not sure if this was for quality check or something else.
- Packaging was not good. Might be negligence from seller.
- Very cheap plastic quality.
- Screw marks found from under the panel locks.
- No visible black bleeding.
- Picture quality on HDMI is better as compared to when connected over VGA.
- On the screen there's a thin lamination which looks like a matte wrap.
- Please check the images carefully.",2
"Okay, I think this is worth every penny, Picture quality and colors are very good for me. I changed the 60hz refresh rate to 75hz rate and is very smooth. Yet to play some AAA games on it but I'm pretty sure it would't make a big difference. I'm not fan of fps shooting games so i high refresh rate and fast response rate computer is not needed.
To be honest the main cover image on the product looked very pale to me I only bought coz it was under 10k, and I was pretty amazed when i open it and switched it on. It was stunning both design and display. I just hope it will last longer.
Very satisfied with packaging, instructions and delivery. Love you Samsung, appario retail and Amazon ! :)",5
"Not great monitor in terms of display quality

- no height adjustable stand. Height of default stand is very low for most people so ended up paying another 2500 for height adjustable stand.
- did not survive warranty period. Display stopped working in 10 months.",1
"I bought two of these for dual monitor setup but both have different brightness even though both are set at exact same setting. I can clearly make it out that one is having a darker colour reproduction than the other. still marking it 4 star as it gets the job done and overall monitors are good. height adjustability and no portrait mode is also not there which is bummer for developers. so if you are a developer you can consider options as well. I am not an avid gamer so can't comment that part.
conclusion - it can be considered at this price point it won't disappoint you much.",4
Why is it blue in colour?? Is it damaged. I just got the product now,5
Bright area at bottom edge of the monitor,1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The best led monitor in 10k range. I have been using the monitor for gaming, watching movies and coding. I can promise u one thing that u will never regret the purchase. I have continuously been infront of the monitor for more than 5hrs and I have never felt any eye strain.",5
"As a CSE student I have a lots of Programming to do in everyday's life. So, basically I ordered it for education purpose. And after using it i am giving some important points.
1. Picture quality is just best in this price point.
So, you don't have to think about it.
2. Design is slim and outstanding also stand is very attractive. So, In first view, You will definitely fall in love with it.
3. It's a 75Hz monitor.
So, if you are a 60Hz monitor user. It will be just a new great smooth experience for you.
4. 24inch
The size is perfect for a Full HD monitor. And the size is perfect for work.
5. Eye Saver mode is very useful while work. It will less the stress of your eyes.
6. If you are a budget gamer it will be a great choice for you. Bt, if you have more budget you can go for a 144Hz display.
7. Definitely value for money.

So, if you want to buy it but thinking for a review.
I will say just go for it.",5
"Pitcher quality is crisp and clear colours are Vived viewing is great, if you confused choose between 27 and 24, go for 24 inch size it is perfect for casual gaming and office work. No led bleeding issue and easy to toggle between vga and hdmi.",5
"The stand could be a little bit better. But, it is not a problem nevertheless. Everything else is just amazing and the best value-of-money product.

There is no height adjustment. ( and it should not be expected at this price). The tilt option is good enough and steady. I am a fast and hard typer and my table and/or monitor don't wobble.

I am planning to get another one for my multi-monitor setup.

I am using this with my Macbook Pro 2019 16inch. It is all good. AMD Freesync also works.

And it is made in Vietnam.",5
"Very good budget monitor for normal office task. Texts are clear and precise.

Screen is almost low profile with minimal bezel. Vesa mount provided.

Colors are ok for general movie viewing or gaming purpose.

The 75hz will not make any difference in gaming.

Really good monitor for wfh purpose.

Will definitely recommend to buy.",5
"Received Today. Seems to be good product overall. I found the older model weighs about 700 gram more and build quality is better. Samsung says this is a T35F IPS 75Hz Panel. I don't know if performance wise this is better than the LS24R350FH Model. But feature wise I find no difference. The stand is made of plastic with no aluminium shield, which is available with the older model.

If you buy the newer T35F model please verify if it is really better than the older one.

Another thing the Model I have received is Made in Vietnam.",4
"Straight to the point!

IPS Display: No you cant say IPS but Samsung had modified VA panel to depict IPS with a higher refresh rate! (You cant identify!) Best for creators and gamers.

Buttons: Analog-stick at back
Brightness: 10/10
Picture Quality: 10/10
Game Mode: Yes 75Hz
Vesa Mount: Yes
Good viewing angles!",5
"I do not write reviews but this product made me to.

A brilliant piece of design. One Word go for it.

This Monitor has a option to which can help us switch modes of brightness when it comes to work and gaming(has better brightness).

There‚Äôs one con I have found since it‚Äôs been a week I have been using it. It is that when we duplicate the display or extend the display from our laptop to this monitor and then close the laptop lid, the video running on the monitor has got some lag and you can easily notice it. This gets resolved when we keep the laptop lid open. I dont know if its a software issue with the windows or Is it a problem with the monitor (i dont think its a problem with the monitor, but anyways I am enjoying my purchase and thinking to buy another one in next monthüòä",5

"The model is new and hence the bezels are very thin. It looks great. The V shaped stand is a little wobbly. But apart from that its perfect.
i did not notice any bleeding of the screen too. Got it for 9500 after the SBI discount and is worth every penny.
They come along with an HDMI cable and the power adapter. No VGA cable in the box. did not bother to check for it either.",5

"got this monitor for my new Ryzen based desktop, only onew word i can say is that its simply awesome both in quality of product as well as looks.
picture is very sharp wiyh very good brightness and bezelless deesign makes it look outstanding.
Only thing missing is DVI port and speaker Jack, but thats not a big issue.
got it mainly for gaming and boy, the games looks awesome in the IPS display.
Got it for Rs10k only during amazon sale.
The delivery was very smooth and total hasselfree.
if you want quality product which is bit costlier then rest others in same segment due to its better quality and after sales service then simply go for this model, SURELY NO REGRETS....",5
"This is really a value for money. An excellent monitor with really good brightness and colors. I have not done any gaming on it hence, this is not a gamer's review. From a regular working professional's aspect this is a really good choice.

The build quality is good. The stand feels sturdy and strong. Overall a bang for buck.",5
"Old model (LCD Technology) and New model (LED Technology) is the exact same price.

I ordered the newer model of the monitor and received an older model. Within 1 hr asked the Customer service team No: 1
to change my monitor they couldn't help they openly said they can't do any changes to my order and cannot do refund or exchanges.

They are playing with words that mentions 7 day replacement but that's puts where there is other wordings like warranty so people mistake them

Team 2 of customer service came on the phone and they said they can help and guess what they ordered a replacement of the same model and serial number. That's not the way Customer service work. Why would I need the same model and serial number replaced again when I have the same thing in my home delivered about 1 hr ago.

3rd Team said they cannot order the newer model and cannot do a exchange and cannot do a refund of the money as well.

So basically I should keep what I ordered and paid.

I shouldn't have bought it in Amazon to be honest just useless team and if they can't help the client who has paid 10K for a monitor they should be bothered about clients going to other E platform sites.",1

"Using this for one week. After searching many products, I found this to be the only one that is ""Manufactured in India (Indian Origin)"" and was well within by budget. It has HDMI and VGA support. Looks are very sleek. The only limitation is that it doesn't have built-in speakers like few others in this category however, you don't need this feature anyways in an external monitor :)",5
Reacently purchase this moniter. In this description they don't mention audio out jack not in the product but i receive the monitor without audio jack so i approched replacement reg but they told me like amazon have some terms and condition replacement process. So they rejected my replecement request this the mainly issue i faced due to proper product detail not there in the site at finally felt a bad experience through this purchase so guys please don't purchase this kind of thinks from amazon.,1

Its bezzels and all other thing are pefrct and premium and total looks good enough...

This display have many configurations also brightness level is freaking goodüëåü§©.

In this price range this one is a worthy product and you must check it out... üí•",4

 Picture quality is wonderful and the bezells are as expected.

packages comes up with stand , power cable and Hdmi cable.

we cant adjust height for this monitor but we can tilt it a little backward and forwad .

So far its going good. Thanks samsung",5
"Not gonna lie, this exceeded my expectations. Pretty much the best you could buy under 10K (I got it for 9400/- )

You could not tell the difference between 75Hz and 60Hz however when I do switch to my laptop which has a 60Hz display, after working on the monitor, I could feel some lag. So, smooth display on this monitor. It gets really bright too, I keep it at 15% only since anything above 30 is too bright for me.

Obviously not for eSports gaming, because of the response time and refresh rate.",5
"Nice product, superb picture quality, good for content creation, it has no backlight bleeding issue, it support 75hz so it's ideal for gaming too, it has one HDMI and one VGA, it don't have display port and dvi port but that's okay for me, it has thin bazel which looks beautiful, only drawback is that it doesn't have sound output port, if you are using it with computer then it's okey otherwise you have to buy hdmi to audio splitter to connect speaker.. overall this is awesome product for this price, go for it..",4
"As expected, good quality LED product from Samsung. Sufficient brightness, good picture quality, thin bezel gives it a modern look.
I‚Äôm using this as a secondary monitor to my MacBook pro and works perfectly.
Just one problem I would point out is that the display viewing angle cannot be adjusted vertically. Also, 1080p on a 26 inch screen means it has a low pixel density and might look pixelated when looked at closely. When I switch between MacBook screen to this screen, the difference is quite noticeable.
But works perfectly as expected for my use case.",4

Update: recieved replacement, but the new one also has the same bleeding issue. I guess it is something that is present in all the units. I will have to live with it. It is noticeable only if picture is darker towards the edges. Otherwise it seems fine.",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Afther 2 month screen started bleeding and one parllel line also came. They are not repalacing the monitor only repairing. My trust was gone on this single product afther this problem came within 2 month. Samsung engg are not replacing this product. I am not very happy with that soloution from samsung",1
"Bought this monitor for WFH use(mostly for office related work). Got this for 9500 in flash sale, and using it for past 2months. I am a UI developer and it served the purpose. screen is of high resolution and great for my need.
Have watched couple of movies in it and the display quality it superb.",5
"I am using monitor for gaming, coding and media consumption.

Pros
1) Slim bezels
2) Good screen (75hz)
3) works well with Mac

Cons
1) no speaker
2) no usb ports
3) extra hdmi port would be handy
4) brightness could have been more",5
"Great monitor for the price, I paid around 8.5k after discounts/cashbacks. The narrow bezel makes it really good, also the matte finish further adds to the appeal.

It has a 75x75 VESA mount which I have used to mount the screen on a dual monitor desk stand. Using it with my Macbook Pro (connected using a dock over HDMI). The monitor also has a VGA input.",5
"Likes: Picture quality, Brightness, sharpness, response time, Beautifully carved out Design, hdmi cable included.
Dislikes: height/angular adjustment missing, No speaker/ audio out port.

Note: Dissatisfied with delivery. 10 days for delivery is a way too much time.",4
Came in Time.. Well packed.. Came along with HDMI wire as I was using VGA till now.. and oh boy.. clarity is amazing in HDMI n 4k n 8k videos are like cinematic in big screen.. This is my 1day review. Hope this last many years.. lets c..,5
"Decent monitor overall. However, there is backlight bleeding on the bottom left part of the screen. It is quite an eye sore when the picture is a shade of black.

Did not exchange it because other reviewers mentioned that backlight bleeding also exists in the monitor they received after the exchange.

Since, I am using it primarily for programming, the bleeding does not affect me much. (Although it would be an eye sore if I use Monokai as the theme of my editor).",3
"It's a very good product at this price point, brightness is very good, pictures are sharp on this monitor, easy to connect and the stand is very sturdy.

cons:
1. thickness could have been reduced when compared to some of the competition.",5
A very good monitor under 10k. The blacks are too good for a IPS panel. There is almost no backlit bleeding from the panel. Only thing samsung can improve is add audio ports and display ports.,5
"If you are looking for a bigger display o increase increase your productivity, this is totally worth it at this price. Great quality. Bright display. 24 inch is really big enough as a computer monitor. HDMI only recommended.

Good handling and delivery time by Amazon prime.",5
"This product of samsung is worthless .

I had to change the display panel of the monitor twice as it went bad, turned completely purple within just 7 months.

Fortunately i had warranty covered for it. Even now i facing issue with the display. Not sure what will happen if the display goes bad again and the warranty is expired",1
"Working as expected. Use it for office work as well as for photo editing. I can clearly see significant difference in colours between the monitor and my laptop screen.
24‚Äù is perfect size for my requirements. Happy with the purchase.",5
"A good product giving excellent value for money so far. Gives good picture quality. I use it for normal PC use, watching movies and editing photos.
The stand however is a bit odd by design. It has a minor tilt down as if the manufacturer expected the monitor to be always placed at ‚Äúhigher than eye‚Äù level. Apart from that, a very good product. Please note that this monitor DOES NOT HAVE INBUILT SPEAKERS.",4
"I set it up first and it was great. Very useful for work as I could see a lot more of my Excel sheets and didn't need to scroll often.
But then I noticed a small internal scratch on the right side of the screen, in the middle. Smaller than my thumbnail. So then I looked for other faults and found a dead pixel.
These were not acceptable to me hence I returned it. Return was seamless, got my refund within a few hours of product pickup.",3
"Got a good product at a good reasonable price after cashback apprx 8.5k. good at the price point, no complaints",4
"Great picture quality and clarity. Default setting of brightness is too high. Please adjust it as suitable to you when you start using the monitor. I connected it with VGA without any graphics card. Still gave crystal clear picture in 1080p. Result would be even better on HDMI. Extra happy due to the ""Eye saver"" option which sets the colour tone such that it's easier on your eyes, especially for long time use.",5
"It is a decent display. Drawbacks are that the stand is not adjustable and there is no audio port. Other than that everything is fine. If you want a good external display without any frills you should go for this, you will be happy.",5
"In this Samsung monitor one person writes a negative review is ""unable to adjust the up & down height adjustment. Just fixed position"". But this is not true. I call Samsung customer service and engineer come to my home and he is practically showing how to tilt monitor up & down side. Don't worry about fixed position. It's very easily possible to tilt. So go with this brilliant picture quality with fully pure LED screen.",5
"Best for budget building PC, good quality output but few spots and light splits from edges this problem I'm getting or all of the monitor have the same problem I'm not sure about that",4
"Good monitor but only draw back is if u want connect this monitor from DP to Hdmi it is too hard get a good connector and if you got one picture quality is bad
So check ur cpu or leptop before u order.",2
"The picture quality of the monitor would be deprived of justice if I included it's pictures in my review. I would like to say that this purchase is one of my best purchases in life and I guarantee it to be the same for all whose work is related to a good display. This monitor is highly recommended. But I would request the buyers to do full justice to such a good product.

Regards,
its_pratim",5
It gives immense satisfaction to watch in this monitor. Display is too perfect. And best for gaming at this price. Try to buy in sale. I got this for 9299 Rs only. So that's too perfect deal for one. I went for samsung instead of acer because it had option for different display,5
"Even I used to search reviews like this and trust me this ones FIRE .... did a lots of research and bought this product and now I‚Äôm happy that all my research and time didn‚Äôt go waste
This product is amazing and fire regarding the visuals size and everything the only concern is that we can adjust the height.

Overall this is a legit product for Laptop gamers and editors.",5
"It's only 72 hz refresh rate not 75hz which is claimed in the product description, not expected from samsung, and also couldn't find any application for on-screen controls.
Rest all is ok for the price.",3
"It‚Äôs pretty good for its price, only thing I didn‚Äôt like is that it‚Äôs angle is not adjustable either. It just stays in fixed angle. But I guess that shouldn‚Äôt be a big problem considering it is an IPS panel
The colours seem fine to me.
The Eye Saver mode works as advertised, it doesn‚Äôt let my eyes strain at night.
Basic but good looking monitor at this price point.",4
Awesome product . Very impressed with the quality and performance. Please note that it do not have audio out port . I just came to know once i received the product .,5
"The monitor worked perfectly fine for exactly a month and 16days. After that the display starts fading and white colour starts bleeding from the four sides.I'ts a total wastage of money. The monitor is now unusable.
Samsung technitions diagonised and said the display panel is defective and it needs to be replaced.
Why are you giving such terrible products to customers and fooling them.",1
Nice picture OK price. But a horrible stand poor quality . No provision to adjust for height or angle. Didn't expect such poor quality from Samsung,3
Monitor is good but it has only one switch for adjustment of screen and put the screen off which is more inconvenient. As usual packing and delivery before promised date by Amazon is excellent,4
"I was using Dell S2240L earlier and coming from that one to this, I am not very pleased. This is not that sharp and the colors are not accurate. Colors seem oversaturared and I could not calibrate it to my liking. Also a second HDMI port would have been helpful.",3
"This display is best in class in this price range.Daytime it feels like an old panel with deep blacks and high contrast.Gaming experience is smooth,but remember to use a good graphics card.Backlight bleeding is very little and viewing angles are great too.If your budget is between 10-15k go for it",5
"You will amazed to see the bezel less display of this monitor and I loved the way it is designed.
If anyone is looking for WFM monitor ..this is best one ..go for it without any second thoughts",5
"Brightness is a bit too high, everything else is nice
There is a bit of Backlight bleeding, but only noticable if the screen is fully black

I adjusted the Setting a bit to reduce the brightness and make the colours the same as on my laptop, you can check the pics above for the Values",4
"In this pendamic time I had to buy a new monitor for WFH. Got to know about Samsung and ITS well known for its display and I don't regret buying this model.
The colors and picture qyality looks stunning.",4
"Ultimate Blacks
Ultimate Colour
Just Amazing Experience
No light bleeding issue at all...lucky maybe
Simply Awesome",5
Excellent product for the price. Quality of picture is very good and perfect for wall mountings and monitor arm.,5
"Amazing quality, absolutely bezel less when 2 monitors kept side by side you won't notice the borders, brightness as expected.... Amazing quality",5
It is not a gaming monitor . But you can play games if you are not a hardcore gamer . The quality is just awesome and the picture quality that is noticable because at the end that is a samsunh led panel .,5
"Great product.
Enjoying work from home and a little bit of gaming.
Good colors and brightness.

Con:
The stand is fixed, not tiltable or height adjustable.",5
Too much black bleeding is there and i got this red dots in screen after 5 days i cant return it now so im replacing it now if further there is problems or defects im going to return it not satisfied with this product. If you are an photoshop user then this is not for you because pictures are little blurry not too sharp,1
"Very good display but if you compare with laptop screen you may find difference. I tried dell, Lenovo and this one among all samsung is close to perfect.",5
Screen and other specifications are good but basic thing of screen height and flip adjustment is not available. We are much disappointed and not happy with the product at all due to absence of Screen adjustment.,1
"Very great product. Received in good condition with box.
I bought this on October. I like the picture quality and use this for my productivity work.
Thought of ordering another unit. But price is too high.I'm waiting for the price to decrease around 10k which seems fair for a 75hz monitor.",4
"Size and built is awesome. It will improve sitting posture compared to working on laptop.
Picture quality can be little better in low light however it won't be felt in daylight.
It's made in Vietnam imported by Samsung India.",4
I won‚Äôt recommend this product at all. The screen didn‚Äôt break but something broke on the inside. I have barely used this product for it to get any damage from my end. I bought this monitor 21th May and the return window closed on 28th May. Such a short window of doesn‚Äôt give you enough time to even judge a product.,1
"Zero stars.
This product is very bad for the eyes. I just got it yesterday and I had to use eye drops. It puts a lot of strain on the eyes. You will always feel sleepy after using this. Display quality is good but it will cost you your eyes.
Better to go with BenQ or LG at the same price.",1
Awesome product excellent picture quality and talking about this size of the screen is 24inc it's big enough for gamers looks big because its a bezel less monitor and very smooth overall I'm very happy with its price and quality,5
"So I received the product today. When I did make my setup, the picture quality was worse then my old laptop, looks like 360p iby connecting through a TV with hdmi. Will recive my gaming cpu after some days I will continue when I receive it",3
"Picture Quality better, look so very quite",1
"I love this product.
Don't live your life in small monitor come to this this monitor , 24"" IPS LED panel is amazing. I felt like I love this.
My brightness is at 40 percent.
I got this for 8500 using 10 percent discount.",5
"IPS display is mentioned on the subs but its some samsung IPS tech .. not worth if you are fan of display and are looking for an IPS display ...switch it off from here.. Dark becomes darker and picture quality goes for a toss.
For office work its good does the job",3
"best monitor under 10 K ..infact i got it for 9123rs. thanks to amazon, i purchased 24 and 22 inch T350FHWXXL , both are excellent",5
The screen got corrupted within a week. There are glitch lines coming on the screen.,1
"Picture quality is good. I am not gamer, so I can't rate on that. Brightness is good.
75Hz refresh rate working fine.

In one sentence, I like to say, I love the monitor completely.",5
I'm seeing only 60 Hz refresh rate for some reasons. The picture quality is bad if you duplicate computer screen onto Samsung display. I'm using a Lenovo L13 laptop with HD TN display.,4
"Highly disappointed, the panel metrial made it very low quality, hdmi and other cable quality are very poor. Not expecting from samsung even though unable to find this product from samsung india official portal.",1
I love this monitor. Got it for 8K and working like a charm after 4 months. Samsung produces best quality display products.,5
The HDMI PORT stop working in 3 months.,1
"This is worst monitor you could buy for 10k, I have worked on dell monitors with similar price range and they are much better.
This monitor has major backlight bleeding issue and quality of text rendered is worst, If you browse web or see even a document the text quality is not even readable. Feels like 90s monitors.",1
"A very good monitor under the given price , hdmi support available no vga port support..but the screen looks very good altogether...very happy but i dont think it is 24 inches it is smaller in size like around 23-22 inches,, but this size screen should be sufficient.",5
"After 6 days i received the product, screen started bleeding where i could see vertical line on the screen.
Picture quality is ok ok not upto the mark, i found that sharpness doesn't reach to margin. There is no extra bubble wrap while shipping the courier. Amazon team can look into it.",2
"Nice product with best display panel as you can expect from Samsung but the panel is not IPS I feel it is not mentioned any where. Overall good product, viewing angles could have been more better.",4
Display and design of display is good but hard to clean screen because of matte finished . over all performance is nice,4
No brightness control. It's very bright now. My eyes are paining now within a week of using it,5
"So far, has been a good monitor for daily work from home activities. Didn't try for Gaming.",5
Great full HD monitor from samsung. But it is shaky with the stand if you dont have a sturdy table. Or else you could use wall mount. I use it with my laptop with a HDMI output. It is a good monitor for casual use. But it does not have an audio output port. Its the only drawback.,4
I started getting white lines just after 1 week. I want to return this. The resolution is not that great when you increase the resolution you can see there are thin and thick lines in the letters basically it's due the screen resolution problem.,1
Seller mentioned as IPS and made in india.but this product is not IPS panel..this made in vietnam.watching movies is very difficult.it display dark as very black..example batman movies ...when watching it is so black..at night shot..please dont buy this fake monitor,1
"Everything is good bt initially was not able to sit for long infront of this monitor
My eyes hurt initially even after lowering the brightness and other features but in a week or two eyes adjusted so no problem now
Idk whether it's a good thing or bad",3
"good monitor, but controls are very difficult to access and change. also no usb port.",4
For gaming,5
Nice monitor. It is fixed one. Doesn't tilt even a bit. Otherwise it gives a royal feeling.,4
"Great quality, no frills monitor, have been using it for 2 weeks now, no issues.",5
"It's just perfect within price.
Picture quality is fabulous. I am very happy with my product. Totally bezel less screen gives you an Amazing cinematic view.",5
Awesome Picture quality,5
Picture quality is good for the price. Colors and black levels are amzing. Thin bazels and cool design. 24 inch is perfect size. Lg for the same prize is not giving thin bazels.,5
"Monitor worked fine at first. Then I restarted my pc and the monitor won't turn on at all, no led indicator, nothing. And yes, I double checked and plugged it into other outlets, still nothing. Monitor lifespan-2 hours... I am so disappointed.",1
If you are editor in Photoshop and 3D like blender it is for you but you are if gamer then go for v a panel this is IPS,5
"Hi All,
just wanted to say this item which i received has backlight bleeding issue and it seems to be a common problem for this model.

color are little washed out. brightness of 250nits is not enough if your room has 2 windows.",3
Much better than what I expected of this monitor. Sharp display and 75 hertz frame rate makes videos really smooth on this monitor,5
Excellent screen and good refresh rate. Fantastic for movie and gaming experience,5
Bas monitor bheja baaki power cable hdmi cable sab cheeje nhi bheja replace ki request par koi response nhi ab amazon fraud kar rha hai,1
"Monitor not working after few days, not even turning on, need service mmediately",1
"Monitor is good, specially for working on office work it's nice display. Only issue which I think is there is no audio port or audio output, so if you are looking for utilizing the monitor for multi purposes in addition to work then you might have to but a accessories to have audio.",4
I had bought this monitor for making my work life easy. The display is crystal clear and crisp. The blue screen filter makes it easy on the eyes as well. Overall it's great value for money and worth buying.,5
Everything is good be it picture quality or etc but I'm facing resolution issue and can't scale the resolution as the navigation bar is half cut.,2
"Using for work and entertainment, quality and build is super good along with display.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 After return window apr6, now a white line appeared on screen . Also a white border found near all sides",1

Only drawback is the auto brightness is too bright in some ambience of the day.",5
"Worth every penny.
Must buy item in this price range. No lag, perfect picture quality, really bazel less, design is awesome. Height adjustment is the only problem with this.",5
"The monitor is really great, sleek design, can be wall mounted, Just go for it .
I have used it for playing games and day to day work and it is just fab!",5
Very good Monitor. I loved it. One reason why I picked this monitor over the other available ones as it said the country of origin is India. However this is not manufactured in India.,5
"The product says 75hz but you can get 73hz max with nvidia control panel, backlight bleeding is a problem too, atleast the cost is low that is main pros.",3
"It has really rich qualities like great display quality , finishing , build quality. A good buy for me",5
"This is not the best monitor, being a Samsung monitor user for the past few years, I can tell you that this is best at this price. My usage doesn't include much gaming, so, this is perfect for my use.",5
"Excellent picture quality
Eyecare feature is there

Not tiltable l/adjustable, Fix position",4
One of best decisions I have taken.This monitor is too good. No complaints till now. Buy it. Value for money plus Samsung quality.,5

 Could add more colour options. Black is good, still it‚Äôs good to have more options.",5
"i purchased this Monitor in sale with around 8200 RS. and it's great at that price.

"everthing is best in this gaming led 75hz, and most one is AMD Freesync If anyone who use AMD Graphic cards than it will give excellent gaming performance :).",4
Today is delivered the two dots on screen appearing i thought that was dust but it's not clearing but then i realise thats a dead pixel,2
Awesome at the budget. Working with dark mode in this monitor is great experience. Colors look accurate. Brightness is bit high. I use to use this at 0%. Don't know why the vertical tilt is too hard.,5
"For 11k having only one hdmi port is not value for money, pic quality is fine",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Black light bleed issue will effect your experience.",1
I was expecting more from color vibrancy from this display.,4
Decent display with good quality build. Only flaw is height cannot be adjusted and monitor does not swivel.,4
"Nice product. Easy to assemble.
-1 star for bad delivery.",4
Samsung is one of the lovley company and that's why I bought. And literally it's too good as expected,5

"I bought this product because I edit videos for a living.
I have a YouTube channel: KTNTECH (You'll find the unboxing and impressions video there)
If you're a gamer do not go with this one.
Because it's an IPS Panel the response times are a lil less and there are tad bit jelly effect while gaming.
If you're a photo/video editor definitely this is for you at least on this budget.
Thanks for reading.
Don't forget to check out the channel :)",5
"Bought this monitor on 5th Jan 2018 at Rs. 15,499 in lightning deal

Following are my observations:
1) The first thing I noticed is that top and side bezels of the monitor are very thin which is aesthetically pleasing and gives it a premium look.
2) Screen is decent and has good brightness and contrast. Not sure about color reproduction but it feels alright.
3) Screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz at 1920x1080 resolution. However it has an option of 75 Hz at 1024x768 resolution also.
4) Even though this monitor has Eye Care (Bright Intelligence), I felt that the sensor adjusted brightness is on higher side for my liking.
5) There is slight backlight bleed at top left corner of monitor which is noticeable only in very dark environments but overall has uniform IPS Glow.
6) Response time mentioned on the box is 5ms (Gray to Gray) and I felt it to be good for FPS games. Overall, it's a good monitor for casual gaming.
7) It comes with UK style power cord and needs a converter/adapter or a spike guard will work.
8) The box also includes HDMI cable and the monitor has cable management as shown in product description which I felt is a nice addition to the package.

Monitor has following ports:
D-Sub
HDMI Port
Display Port
Line-in port and
3.5 mm jack for plugging in earphones

This monitor also has in-built speakers which are pointed downwards. The quality of audio from them is nothing to brag about and max volume is that of a typical tablet (my iPad Pro 12.9"" 2017 has better sound output than them) but no complaints here considering the price of the monitor.

Overall this monitor is value for money product considering the price I got it for.
Cheers to Amazon for on-time delivery.

Feel free to ask any questions about the product, will be glad to help!",5
"I have worked on many monitors (Dell, HP, Acer) in office and home. Never had a Benq. I will get this out of the way, my favourite brand is Dell (I have bought around 10 products). I was torn between the Dell (2717H), Viewsonic and Acer. For some reason I never had a good experience with products of HP.

My requirement was a 27"" monitor. I am not a serious gamer only play casual games from time to time. The main purpose was to do programming and watching videos (and reading). This monitor suits perfectly.
Pros:
- Excellent display. It had a bit of light bleed on top right corner but it was just the glass a bit out. I just pressed it in and the bleed was gone.
- Good contrast and viewing angles. I have not played any FPS games till now but overall the experience till now (10 days) has been smooth and consistent. The 5ms response time is good enough for me.
- Although it is a 1080p display, the text and videos appear sharp, no pixelation or ghosting. Colours are uniform and even.
- Bluelight filtering is good. Helps when reading a long book / article and puts less strain in the eyes.
Cons:
- The Eyecare feature is a bit aggressive. The display becomes too bright for the surrounding light. I just switched it to standard and set the brightness and contrast to levels I am comfortable with. The day/night light in my room doesn't differ much so I don't need to change the settings.

Other monitors with similar features were around or over 20k, I got this for 17k. Overall a very good budget monitor. It also has 3 years warranty which is good and tells that I can expect a pretty long life from this.

Let me know if you need to know more.",5
"I bought it mainly for its auto brightness. But, the brightness doesn't go too low there is no light around. So, I had to stop using the feature that I especially looked upon. Anyway, it's a value for money product. Good fit for someone who uses it occasionally. Not recommended for you are going to stare at the monitor for around or over 8 hours a day. For such use cases, better to go for Dell ultrasharp monitors. They are costly, but your eyes would thank you for sure.",4
"I was skeptical about this BenQ G480 eye care 24‚Äù inch monitor first. After a lot of research, I found this monitor too good for regular reading and office work. I previously had a DELL 21.5 inch monitor which that has a really thin bezel on the side and the top. Further, it is quite good in color production along with two fine speakers at the bottom.

Now, for the last 1 year, I had this severe pain in my eyes as I mostly work in front of the screen. The pain gradually increased at times I couldn‚Äôt even stare at the screen perhaps, due to the harmful blue light emission. I was waiting for the shopping days to come up where I can buy a decent monitor(bigger size) and also that could help me get rid of severe eye strain.

As I already use blue cut lenses I did not find the previous monitor abstain harmful blue light. And this time I have decided to buy the BenQ monitor 24 inches (Eye Care). I did not expect to be excellent in color production either I play games using this.
After, I received the monitor which I purchased just for 7.8k during the festive season deal.

I found the feature ‚ÄúLow blue light‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrightness intelligence technology‚Äù - uses a dedicated sensor to map out the ambient lighting to adjust the temperature and brightness of the screen which seriously I have never seen on budget monitors.
Anyways, I am quite happy with the purchase I have tested and experienced no flicker issue neither extreme blue light emission after you have just switched to ‚ÄúLow blue light emission‚Äù.

In addition, I received a major upgrade to 24 inches that allow me for seamless reading. Moreover, the monitor comes with 36 months of on-site warranty but sadly, you can register the monitor on their website there is no option to do that.
I have seen people complaining about the screen bleeding issue. Fortunately, I did not face anything yet.

I am in love with my new 24 inches BenQ monitor irrespective of having 5 ms response and limited to 60Hz refresh rate. This monitor is perfect for and reading, working for a longer duration but can‚Äôt say about photo or video editing work. I purchased the monitor mainly seeing the eye care technology that puts less strain on eyes even after continuous usage of 6 hours.

I have attached several photos of the monitor and how it looks exactly. Also, I have tried to show the features that you can access using the buttons beneath the screen.",5
"This monitor is really good at this price point ( I got it for 9499 during amazon sale )
Pros:
1.Colors are much more Vibrant then normal LED's, i have a triple monitor Setup so i can compare this with other LED's
from dell.
2.Dark and Bright values are much better differentiated.
3.The best one is the price you cant get any thing better than this at this price Point...Kudos to Benq for that
4. Brightness is way too much high
5. Multiple connecting options ( i plugged it to my PC as well as my PS4)

Cons
1. There is some back light bleeding ( But that is ok even expensive monitors has minor light bleeds)

At this price point i think Benq has done a great job.
if you want a cheap IPS display then this monitor is for you.",5
"The monitor is well built. Quality is also good. However, It's painful for the eyes if you do text based stuff. The fonts will look blurred. It seems that 22inch or lower size monitors are best for Full HD Resolution. 24inch monitor will have larger pixels which will make text blurry and affect eyes. If you just want a bigger monitor, spend more money and go for Ultra HD ones. Otherwise, you may regret it as I have. Looking forward to selling mine!",3
"The BenQ 27 is an amazing monitor the most interesting that I loved about this monitor is its slim bezels on the sides and top. I've connected it with Laptop and the output quality is uncompromised and looks good. it also has an inbuilt speaker (but I never used it because it's not good in my opinion).

Moreover, the texture on the display is well finished with Matte so it could block glossiness and reflection. The monitor comes with a control panel to adjust different settings related to colors and sound. It also comes with a set of Color schemes preset, which are also customizable. Right beside the control panel buttons, it has a power LED indicator too.

My overall experience with this monitor is amazing.",5
"Good product, performance is excellent and exceptional difference or upgrade in my viewing experience. Suggest the product to buy if anyone is thinking to buy one in budget, though I still have a doubt whether it is an LED or LCD as I received a manual saying LCD in the packet.

I wish to buy one more if I get a clarity on this LCT/LED thing ..",5
"I bought this in late December 2019 for 12.9K. I had switched to this from a 22 inch LG monitor (model 22MP68VQ, to be precise). The color reproduction on that monitor was downright brilliant. So, when I plugged this one in out of the box, to be honest, I was somewhat disappointed. The colours looked so faded and unappealing, the blacks were nowhere near black and the overall panel appeared to be so low quality, that I almost contemplated returning it.

However, when I tinkered with its settings, boy was I amazed. The color reproduction improved massively, including the contrast and brightness. I also made some changes to the Intel display driver's setting (mine is a Windows system), however, that might be different for you based on your system.

First and foremost, go to ""Picture Advanced"" menu on the OSD (on-screen display), and set Picture Mode to ""User"". This will turn off all settings such as Bright Intelligence, Low Blue Light, etc. (Trust me, you don't want to keep them enabled for the best picture quality). Then navigate to ""Picture"" tab in the main menu. Here are the monitor's settings that worked really well for me:

1. Brightness: 100 (you may lower it if it hurts your eyes)
2. Contrast: 60
3. Sharpness: 5
4. Gamma: 5
5. Color Temperature: Normal
6: Hue: 50
7. Saturation: 50

Once you have tweaked settings to the above numbers, you will see it greatly improves the picture quality. However, if you have an Intel display driver like I do, you can tweak the settings there too for an even better picture. Here are the steps for that:

1. Search ""Intel Graphics Command Center"" in start (this may be different for you if you're running an older driver). If you can't find it in start, you should be able to right-click on your desktop and go to Intel Display Settings too.
2. Navigate to the ""Display"" tab.
3. Go to ""Color"" tab in the window.
4. Leave ""Brightness Enhancement"" to default at 50.
5. Change ""Contrast Enhancement"" to 48 from 50.
6. Enable ""Luminance-based Color Model"". (THIS IS A MAJOR GAME CHANGER)

And voila! Your these settings would breathe a new life into an otherwise dull default settings.

One thing to note here is that the piece that I received had slight IPS glow / backlight bleed from upper left corner, mostly noticeable in very dark environments with 100% brightness (see attached picture). However, it is very common in IPS displays, and gets worse as the screen size increases. I didn't want to gamble with a replacement product, so I chose to stick with this one. Mine came with zero dead pixels, so I was worried about the replacement being worse (more backlight bleed / presence of dead pixels).",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The product is very good. Eye care setting has options like Multimedia, Reading etc... I usually keep Multimedia while playing games and Reading when I am coding and doing office work. I usually spend 8 hrs per day infront of PC, I didn't experience any eye strain. Vertical adjustment is not there, so if you have comfortable chair and table, it's good. Inbuilt speakers are good enough. Like other commented, I did not expect a home theatre like speakers from a monitor. Its suitable for hearing computer sounds and attending meetings with client. Build quality is good. I bought it for 7750Rs, Because of Corona pandemic prices are increasing, I don't have any option and didn't wait for the deals. I feel happy for purchasing this.",5
After using the monitor for 2 weeks I noticed that the top part of the screen has a white spot and also the edge of the monitor is open from the top (pic attached). The return date is now over. I feel cheated. Really upset with Amazon.,1
"Pros:
1. Tiny bezels
2. Great colour composition
3. Good collection of input options
4. Vesa mount compatible
5. Pocket friendly

Cons:
1. Inbuilt speakers are useless. They don't reproduce complete sound spectrum properly.
2. Brightness is a bit low. Difficult sometimes in bright daylight
3. Menu control system UI is very bad",4
"Display: I bought this monitor as a secondary display to aid my programming. The text display in Windows 10 is awfully pixelated and not at all crisp. If you are buying this for text based usage, strictly stay away. I can't emphasize more. All the other display related features are absolutely miserable.
Sound: The less we talk the better. The speaker volume and quality is fit for nothing absolutely pathetic sound. I don't know why this feature exists.
The Bomb: You cannot return, can only replace. No matter how you try the display is ending up being garbage
I gave 5 stars because most of the people only read 5 star ratings and I don't want my rating to slip through.",5
"Absolutely amazing monitor. Definitely recommended for the price. Best value for your money in the segment without a doubt. After days of research and enquiries for a 22"" monitor, and comparing it with Dell's & HP's, I ended up buying a pair of GW2283's for my video editing setup. What a delight to the eyes! Go for it without a doubt, I'm not regretting a single penny spent. Definitely at par with Dell's & HP's IPS 22"" monitors, saving you around 1k for the same performance and build quality. Maybe if you search this in your local market, you can buy it for a bit cheaper. But I had no option as such so went on via amazon.

Pros-
1. Although I have a dual-display setup, a single 22"" will be productive enough for most of the tasks, especially this having a 1080p res.
2. This thing is built like a tank! So robust and heavy, i wasn't expecting it to be of this premium built-quality for the price I paid. This thing is HEAVY! Durability- 11/10.
3. Really good panel. BENQ has been an understated brand but believe me, the actual display quality is no less than it's competition, even at comparatively lower prices. Brightness- 8/10 | Sharpness- 9/10 | Color Accuracy (in the segment)- 9/10 | Anti-glare Display- Good readability in direct light (though it reduces the overall brightness but the negotiation is worthy) | Great Viewing Angles and Adjustability- IPS panel, nothing more to say.
4. I/O management deck- definitely helpful to keep things organised when you got crazy wiring all around as in my setup. Practical design.
5. Also the overall packaging was really good. It came all foamed up in a double cardboard box. Good job Amazon. BENQ package was however far superior with all kinds of protection.

Cons-
1. No HDMi cable provided in the package, although the monitor itself has 2√ó HDMi ports. Just 1 VGA cable (of good quality) provided.
2. Only tilt adjustment for the stand, no height and swivel adjustment, but that's just nit picking. Won't expect that from the segment.
3. This thing is heavy. But definitely it has its benefits in terms of durability.
4. The built-in speakers are just, meh! Not too loud, not too crisp and clear. Just average. Does the job. Sounds more like a mono rather than stereo, but I personally use headphones for my job so no big deal for me.
5. It is not completely bezel-less design. There is a thin in-display bezel after the rim of the panel. Actually the overall bezel is more like 3mm from all sides when actually booted up. Its not absolutely bezeless as they show in the picture, but the crop is minimum.

Verdict- Overall a great, robust, practical and powerful tool for your setup if you want durability, great display quality, performance and practicality. Nothing fancy, but still looks appealing, sleek and smooth to the eyes. Highly recommended to pick one of these uo, you wont regret for what you spend.
1080p Res, 60Hz refresh rate, IPS panel features, robust design and build quality, premium looks, super practical. What else do you expect for 7.5k bucks?

JUST GO FOR IT.",5
"Please don't buy if you are trying to buy it for macbook. It doesn't work with macbook pro even with original hdmi to type c adaptor. The resolution is not good.
Benq technical teams recommendation to fix this issue was to ""use different hdmi to type-c adapter available in the market"" and pray that one of them works as they have verified it from other customers, but they are not ready to share which adapter to use. Wasted 2 weeks talking to benq customer but then they are not ready to help.",1
"Having used Dell Ultrasharp 24 in, I ordered this one after reading great reviews on it. After trying all kinds of options for three days, it still tired my eyes in no time. In comparison, I can work on DELL U2415 Display for hours! I returned it after four days of wasted effort. May be people who have given highly positive reviews for programming as well have not used Dell U2415. The latter is pricey, but I am going to buy more of the same. Nothing beats 24-inch (1920 x 1200) in crispness, quality, and very low eye strain! The extra 200 pixels in width adds a lot to the comfort!

Can't comment on gaming capabilities.",1
"I have been using multiple monitors over the year, I usually change the monitor in an year or so. This is just an amazing product. I have moved the TV and kept this monitor at its place as even my Sony bravia TV did not match the video quality of benq, I would give my 200% review for this product. If u like movies and want to watch 1080p videos on YouTube this is best. I am amazed that I spent 6000 rs almost twice a year buying bad monitors but this is best monitor with real life feeling of videos. Buy it u won't regret it.
Anyone who has visited my house has said that this is a amazing And videos looks like life like video can't explain. But this is the closest I have gotten for the past 14 years to a monitor which is TRUE HD",5
"After seeing so many good reviews, I got this monitor hoping I‚Äôll get a good product but was disappointed. Seller was Appario.

Firstly, the amazon packaging was torn and damaged from one corner. It shows how carelessly they have handled a delicate product like this.

Coming to monitor:
1) I see the bottom bezels are not uniformly aligned to the screen, this was causing heavy screen bleeding from bottom.
2) It claims it is an IPS display but it‚Äôs just a cheap LCD. The blacks and dark colours are horribly faded. Details are lost in shadowy parts of scenes.
3) It claims to have 178 degrees viewing angle but if you‚Äôre sitting even 45 degrees from the centre the details start to get faded.
4) And about speakers I‚Äôm still wondering why they even bothered putting that in the first place. Total wastage.

I don‚Äôt know if all the monitors are like this or if I got a lemon. I‚Äôm starting to doubt that this is a refurbished monitor and used a cheap IPS or LCD panel which gives its such a faded look, but the other reviews said that it‚Äôs ok to have that much backlight bleed into their screen, so maybe it‚Äôs the product itself. Anyways I‚Äôm not happy about the product being an IPS display behaves like a 10 year old LCD models.
Either ways I‚Äôm returning it never to buy this product again. I‚Äôll rather check the new LG or Samsung models which I hope would give the IPS display of the quality which they claim on their products.",1
"I have worked for fair amount on some really good monitors and this isn't one of them. Only reason I bought this is because of 5 star ratings. Most people who have rated it 5 stars have probably not used a good display before and they got amazed easily after purchasing this. But believe me DO NOT buy this if you have already used a good monitor like Dell or Apple. You can purchase two for dual monitor setups because both have mostly similar colours. Let me tell you why I'm saying this.
Pros: Cheap, Sturdy construction, thin bezels, non glossy finish unlike Samsung's or LG's ugly shiny displays. Thats it.
Cons: very poor color calibration, in some cases the colours are just worn out and in some cases it gets overexposed,
Speakers...they suck 2/10 score,
The ports, there should have been at least one display port.
Brightness (it is too bright on its default settings, you can keep it that way if you want some more addition to your electricity bill)
Saturation, hue options are useless and only makes it look worse.
The eye care tech is nothing but a gimmick.

I have been using a Dell 21.5 inches monitor for almost 7 years now and even now its a lot better than this Benq one. My Dell monitor has thin borderless bezels, accurate colours, a good display screen and even has the ability to overclock from default 60 hz...I've raised mine to 74hz.
Honestly if Dell was selling this monitor right now, I would have purchased it without a second thought. I had to purchase Benq because I needed something cheaper.
Instead of the useless speakers and stupid eye care tech, they should have made a better panel with accurate colours and brightness.
I am disappointed.
Update: After many-many trail and errors and web research, I am somewhat able to adjust the monitor's display to somewhat accurate colours. Still I won't recommend it to people who have already used a good display.",3
"I brought this product thinking the best and I made a great mistake, I picked this over DELL that I repent till now. The first 10 days the product was good after that spotted a small line in the middle of the screen. I have registered a complaint with the team REF: R200301312 and no one bothered to reach me till now. Escalation number 9560055022 was also not reachable. If you want to spend your hard-earned money put in a well-reputed brand.",1
"I purchase this monitor on Oct 21,2020, I could not able to switch on the monitor due to 3 pin power cord(cable) is not able to insert any of my switch box or extension board which is big and not fitting and I contacted the Amazon customer care they said better to buy a power cable or plug separately which is really not expected from the Benq and I felt 16A cable unnecessary here, please consider this point while buying this monitor.",1
"Overall the monitor is great but there're a couple of issues I would like to point out.

Being an IPS panel, this monitor suffers from back light glow. Blacks are not fully black. This is not noticeable if one is working in well lit environment. However, in a dark environment at night it does cause eye strain.

The buttons on the monitor are physical push buttons. It would have been great if they were touch buttons. Physical buttons tend to get defective over a period of time.",4
"When the product arrived, it was sealed in a thick box and multiple layers of plastic. But eventually when I got to the sealed tape, I found it had already been broken apart. I decided to test out the monitor instead of returning the opened box and that was the mistake I did. After 10 days, the top half of the screen on the monitor became dimmer and duller for no reason. There is absolutely nothing great about this monitor to write about.",1
"This monitor has met all the features that I need for it's price. Here is my review for Benq GW2780.

The good -
- The monitor is well built and beautifully designed with all the matte surface and textured plastic. It looks clean and simple.
- I am very happy to find no Backlight Bleed at any part of my monitor which is very prominent among IPS panel based monitors. There is just the ""IPS glow"" which is completely normal for an IPS panel.
- The viewing angles are excellent.
- The monitor size (27 inches) is big enough for all the entertainment needs.
- It has a popular and standard resolution of 1920x1080 (Full HD). I'd say that this resolution for a 27 inch monitor with 81 PPI (Pixels per inch) isn't really that bad, which means it is good enough for text based content and other entertainment.
- It has some inbuilt features called the ""Low Blue Light"" mode and ""Brightness Intelligence"", which works great in reducing strain if you work for several hours. Brightness Intelligence feature automatically adjusts the monitor's brightness by sensing the lighting conditions in the room without needing to change the brightness manually.
- Many connectivity options including the DisplayPort, two HDMI ports and an audio port.
- The pixel response times are really good. You can find no issues in fast paced FPS Games.

The bad -
- The inbuilt speakers sound really low.
- There is some weird bug in the OSD (On-screen Display) menu of the monitor, where changing the Gamma value doesn't change anything in the picture. But, it doesn't really matter because the default Gamma value is the standard anyway.

Conclusion - This is a nice, all feature packed PC Monitor for it's price, you will never find in other monitors, at least for now. You can go for it!",4
"I purchased this monitor for the sole purpose of using it as a vertical monitor. My job requires me to read a lot on my PC, and ever since I started using one a few weeks ago, vertical monitors have become indispensable in my Work From Home setup. This is my second such monitor, the first one been a Dell P2419H, commendably serving my requirements in the office. At home, however, I felt the need for a slightly larger screen; one that can be kept at a distance, so that my study table isn't cluttered. The Dell P2719H was my first consideration. Its asking price, however, far exceeded the budget I had allocated for the purpose. My second option was the HP E273 - again, priced as much as the Dell, so was dropped. The third option was a model by AOC (a brand I didn't know a lot about). It seemed to tick all the boxes, and in fact I even ordered it. And that's when I came across this new Prime Day launch by BenQ. It was going at ‚Çπ17,500, a good ‚Çπ3500 less than the Dell's asking price. So it didn't take me long to convince myself to cancel my AOC order, and opt for this BenQ monitor instead.

On its own, this is a good monitor, and one that does its job well. Its when you have the luxury to compare it with another IPS panel, that you notice the shortcomings. Like I said, the IPS panel on the BenQ GW2780T is good, but Dell's panel is better. The build quality is good, but Dell's is superior. The BenQ's speakers are rubbish, and my laptop's internal speakers are way better. No, seriously. The speakers on the BenQ are terrible, and aren't even loud enough to justify their inclusion. The Dell, on the other hand, did not even bother to mount any speakers, for better or worse; instead, Dell comes with a built-in USB hub, which is a far more useful feature to have. It has 2 USB 3.0 ports, and 2 USB 2.0 ports. The slower USB 2.0 ports are useful to plug in your wireless keyboard/mouse dongle, and the the USB 3.0 ports are always useful to have if you wish to leave your portable HDD plugged in (haven't tested their transfer speeds). Hands down I'd opt for Dell's USB hub feature over BenQ's terrible internal speakers. Both Dell and BenQ offer matte finish panels, which are inherently less reflective, unlike the HP E273, I think.

Like I said, the Dell's display panel is, in my opinion, superior to the BenQ's. Lesser backlight bleeding and better colour reproduction are two things that I immediately noticed. Also, the viewing angles are better on the Dell, although both BenQ and Dell house IPS panels. Then again, BenQ's panel is more than sufficient for my requirement, which is to read documents and articles in the vertical position. Both the panels appear to have a similar set of additional features, with one model offering something that the other doesn't, and vice versa.

To sum up: but for the significant price difference, I would have opted for the 27"" version of Dell's offering. But that doesn't mean that BenQ's GW2780T is a bad monitor by any means. In fact, on its own, I think its a very capable monitor, and its capabilities match my requirements sufficiently. But if and when you do find the price difference to be negligible, I would suggest you opt for the Dell's offering. You will not go wrong in opting for this BenQ monitor. Its just that Dell is better, and it costs a lot more.",4
"Initially I ordered for 27"" monitor, and I received 24"". Then it got replaced. And then at very 14th day after I got the replaced product, It's main board got damaged and I was unable to connect using HDMI cable. When I complaint to BenQ Head office at Gurgaon, The team is totally incompetent. Their Manager Deepak Khurana is on leave, and his represent member Om Prakash himself says that he cant do anything without Deepak. Let him return from leave. The entire team just play email - email within their own team only, and the customer just watches the show as an Audience. It's almost a week now and I have still not got any result.

I would urge every buyer to not buy this product ever as I have lost my 12k in this plus I am on leave for my office for not having monitor. These salary deductions are extra losses for me",1
"The monitor is indeed good but of substandard build quality. I purchased it in August 2020 for 8k. Till a week back it was working fine and then suddenly when I wake up one morning there is a black line on the screen. I contacted customer support. They registered the call but when the technician visited he said it is damaged and I can't do anything, you better buy a new one as the cost to replace a panel is the same as this monitor (WHAT?). I was keeping the monitor really well and it did not fall at all, had it fallen it would have had some dents, there were zero dents and scratches. In this Oct sale, I purchased the Dell Monitor which should last longer than this BenQ thing. I really thought well of the product after reading the reviews but it indeed turns out of substandard build quality.

Poor aftersales support.",1
"First Things First:

You need to activate the Eye Care feature in the monitor. It is not ""ON"" by default. I realised it after 3-4 months of usage! :/

Replacement under warranty:

My initial monitor developed a vertical line after 3 months of usage. No particular reasons for the line. Raised a complain with the BenQ customer care in their prescribed format. They immediately accepted the fault and agreed to replace the monitor under warranty.

Got the replacement of the monitor in 4-5 working days. No hassles, no paperwork. Appreciate the quick and professional response.

Coming to the monitor:
My usage is extensively for work purpose and seldom for watching movies.

This monitor meets both my requirement. The Anti-glare feature is particularly impressive. I also work late at night, with the lights switched off. The monitor auto adjusts the display brightness according to the light in the room. However, this feature has to be activated from the menu in the monitor.

Overall - Go for it if you are looking to buy for work purpose and little bit of videos/multimedia.",5
"Received unsealed / tampered piece
The delivery agent has opened the seal to keep the invoice inside the box - yes sounds very stupid to hear to such stories used to cover up.

"The blue light filters works well and make it comfortable to read for long time... bezel is narrow...only issue I am facing is that when blue filter is enabled in reading mode monitor does not allow to vary brightness or other picture settings...it's prest...without filter enabled settings can be varied. The auto brightness adjust is an added feature, though it works... It does not make much difference to the picture....in addition to providing setting to vary sensitivity they should also have provided gain",4
"I have purchased this item from Amazon, I have paid Rs.7890/-

Pros:
1. Design which will attract you first.
2. Eye protection display
3. Sensor to adjust brightness
4. Dual HDMI
5. It comes with a small speaker (Don't expect a good one, but within budget this is a good thing)
6. Audio Jack if you needed.
7. 3 Years warranty
8. Cable management deck

Cons:
1. Brightness is saturating when you watch netflix or youtube.
2. No HDMI inside package, instead you will received old VGA cable.

So basically it is perfect for budget.
## If you are a Macbook user and want to use it as external display then go for it.

"i ordered my first monitor on 7th June and it had problem with the lcd it had a hairline crack near the right bezel of the display, as I saw the crack I immediately placed a replacement order and it came in just two days on 9th June but the replacement had a bigger issue the top bezel wasn't fully glued in so the dust would've sneaked the way into it destroying the display and thank god that I returned it quickly in my amazon return window cause benq customer care sucks I called them emailed them but no one helped me with this issue so I ended up returning it and getting my amount back, Now I've ordered dell P2419H I should've ordered it first hand cause dell has quite the reputation for the quality displays,
picture quality is great if you can get a good monitor for them also color accuracy is great too but the light sensing feature is kinda buggy when you switch the color presets,
go for this monitor if you have time and you believe in luck cause sure enough my luck wasn't the great with this monitor.
i'd say that spend a couple thousand more and go for the dell or any reputed company which is recognized for its customer service.
i hope this helps",1
"**Update*
After 2 months of use. got vignette effect on screen. Waiting for Benq Service center to fix it :(

1. 27inch FHD IPS display is great to have for work.
2. The Vertical monitor setup by rotating the monitor is also a good addition, I wish the screen rotates/changes from portrait to landscape automatically instead of setting the display settings on macbook pro.
3. Swivel on 24 inch monitor rotates the neck of the monitor where as on 27 inch the neck doesn't rotate on swivel the monitor base has a movable pad so the entire monitor can be moved but not similar to the GW2480T (24 inch model)
4. Cable management is good, I like the thoughtful ness went into the monitor handle on back, very handy one if you want to move monitor.
5. Brighness intelligence with EyeCare features are great additions.",5
"Update:
Bought it after some time and this unit seems to be defect free. Although its only 1 day, will test it for few more days but overall value for money device.

I bought this one after a long research over Dell P2419H. The vertical mode is really useful for long document reading with less scrolls. Stand is really nice and build quality is good. It does not shake even at max height.

Brightness and colors looked natural. Although I received a defective piece and in right 25% portion there was bluish tint. It is panel defect and can not be fixed. I returned on same day and now waiting for some time. because i believe if I order again they will send me one from same batch which can be faulty again.",4
"I purchased this monitor 6 months before, and now I am starting to see eye visible (70%) of the screen with yellow light bleed. I logged a complaint for replace and they just gave back the same monitor saying all is OK. I then logged another complaint, and called the company managing the support services, the person was not helpful just stubbon saying this is not a problem until the complete screen is dead. Absolutely useless BenQ support. It is not about photography monitor, its a simple IPS screen issue, I have used IPS monitors all my life and I know about light bleed. I have now given an order for Dell ultrasharp 24inch which has great warranty support stating ""Even if a single pixel is brighter we will replace the complete screen"". And hence I will always recommend buying dell monitors, please!!. I tried to find the receipts of Benq support, but I probabibly thown them into trash long ago.",1
"""A Normal (Not a Gamer or an Editor) User's Perspective""
‚úÖDesign : Almost Bezel-less seems Attractive.
‚úÖPanel Quality : Excellent (No bleeding and nice Blacks for an IPS).
‚úÖPicture Quality : Excellent Colors (Can be tweaked up or tweaked down using Control buttons according to the preferences).
‚úÖConnectivity : HDMI (In the box) and VGA.
‚úÖAudio : Speaker is not worth it but 3.5mm Audio Jack is useful.
‚úÖOther Features : Brightness, EyeCare Sensor (Some might find it useful)
‚úÖAssembling : Fitting the Stand is a Two-Step process (Just follow the Manual) also Wall mounting is possible it seems.

First of all this is my very first product from Benq.I am not that much aware of this company. I am very much confused before buying this product anyway after continous search on Internet I made a list for the 27 inch monitors to be purchased. Almost all leading brands monitors are above 18000 rupees however I got this product below 15000 rupees. The performance of the product is awesome. I bought this monitor for reading purpose especially for the PDF reading in a very big screen. This screen serves the purpose with reduced glare and good clarity. Those who want to purchase a big screen with reduced price with good performance and good clarity you can buy this benq 27 inch monitor.,5
"Not that great,, because contrast is not that great ... Cause lots of eye strain !!! Full hd quality is not up to mark ... ... It's not smooth ...",1
"Pros:
Picture: Excellent Full HD and real like picture wit matt finish.
Audio: Served the purpose as TV at full volume in a small room.
Could be used as TV with HD Set top box as no IPS TV upto 32"" could offer Full HD and blue ray reduction. Provision of external speakers are also available.
Con:
No screw supplied with the box (only DV, HDMI cable and Indian power plug)
No USB port.

Excellent product. Delivery in 1 day as promised by Amazon.",5
"It‚Äôs a great product for the price but terrible service in Chennai. The monitor I received has one display port and one HDMI and the display port isn‚Äôt working. So I called BenQ customer care and was put in touch with the local service provider. But the local service provider refused to even come take a look at the product and tried to resolve all my queries through phone/WhatsApp! He gave me all the most obvious solutions that any person with electronics knowledge would try before calling customer care‚Äîmaybe he assumed because I‚Äôm a woman, I don‚Äôt know even basic things about cables and cable quality. Even after I tried to explain that I‚Äôve tried everything he was suggesting, his only advice was to buy more expensive cables. Very annoying and ultimately futile.",3
"There is no option to reduce Brightness, though blue light is filtered, we are unable to reduce the brightness which is stinking eyes especially during nights and brightness sensor though working it doesnot make difference to the brightness and we are ending up using more tubelights to reduce screen glare and thereby ending up in using up more electricty, so the purpose of eye care is not solved during nights.",3
"I am writing this review after 5 months of use.
In absolute terms (cannot compare with others), the monitor is very good.
For general media consumption the picture quality is awesome. (I am not a content creator and cannot say anything in the regard)
It is fairly light and compact (bezel less from three sides).
It has an all the necessary ports; aux, HDMI and external speakers.
Brightness is good and you can comfortably view things even in a well lit room.
The menu functions are easy to access, although the ambient sensor doesn't look calibrated and doesn't work properly. I use it in fixed brightness mode only.
Speakers are awful. I would definitely recommend buying a non speaker version and save some money. Maybe invest in decent external speakers.

Quality issues- A pixel went dead recently.Although it is very small and hardly visible, I hope overtime it doesn't affect nearby pixels or ""grow"".

A note on size:
I bought a 27"" monitor with thinking that bigger is better. However, your field of view depends on the desk size (etc). Emperically, buy a 27"" monitor only when your desk size > 2 feet. Otherwise in some cases, like while playing games, you won't be able to full screen.",5
"I had to request a replacement as the product had dead pixels, and even replacement monitor had dead pixels too.

Finally, returned replacement monitor and requested a refund.

After getting delivery use any screen tester utility to verify if you have any dead pixels or not.",1
"GW2480 24-inch - Got it for just below INR 10K.
Overall it is just a average to good monitor for day-to-day usage. But nothing impressive.
Pros:
* All the usual functions work as expected
* Picture quality is good but one needs to set the brightness very high to get better picture quality.
* Although the bezels are thin, it looks sturdy.
* HDMI cable included in the pack. So, no need to buy that separately (like few other monitors in the market)
* Wall mounting
* Several preset picture modes
* Price-INR 10K
Cons:
* Slight darkening of the panel on both vertical sides near the edges when viewed exactly from middle on low brightness (around 40% or less). This is kind of typical LCD drawback of old days but didn't expect it from Benq brand. That too in 2021. But this goes away for higher brightness is set (of course, that will strain the eyes)
* Although there are several preset picture modes with respective brightness/contrast with bright display, most of the pre-defined ones are too bright for daily usage and one can't adjust the brightness and some other settings for these pre-defined modes.

Felt that my 10 year old Dell All-in-one 2310 had better display overall (although bit enhanced colour & colour/contrast calibration wasn't possible with it).

I was bit skeptical before buying and that skepticism was very valid I guess. As these companies churn out these monitors with less than INR 10K, I guess they are cutting some corners.",3
"It's undoubtedly the best product, with superb Display almost bezel-less.
There are many Pros and Cons comparisons available, so I am not adding one more.
But just to let you know that the Audio output is too low, as its a Monitor and not a TV.
The cable which comes along is HDMI to HDMI and I needed HDMI to DisplayPort so I have to struggle a bit find out an alternative, and I end up finding an old VGA cable but looking for HDMI to DisplayPort for Audio playback via Monitor.
I had another laptop that has HDMI port, so I tested with it for the Audio output but sometimes I was able to play Audio from the Monitor and most of the time it plays from the laptop only. Unable to figure out is it a bug or I am missing anything.",5
"The monitor works with both MacOS and Ubuntu as I have connected to both and they worked seamlessly. In case of connecting to Mac need a HDMI to USB-C adapter.
The monitor is really good for the current work from home situation. I initially had planned to order a mountable monitor with a separate mountable arm to use for the monitor and my laptop. As the mount was currently not available, decided to order this monitor with the adjustable height stand. The stand can keep the top of the monitor adjustable between 15 and 21 inches above the table level. I found this more than enough to get it up to my eye level. The monitor came packaged in a relatively eco-friendly packing.
The picture quality is fine and I think could work as a backup TV for me to watch anything online if the TV is occupied. The sound quality is decent for an in-built one.
The only negative so far I found is a dead pixel on the screen towards the right side of the screen. Don't think its worth trying to get the monitor replaced for that one pixel. The only thing missing probably is a inbuilt camera/microphone.",5
"I know you guys must be wondering why my review title says ""Dont buy"" but I have given 4 star rating to this product. It's because this product comes with a 16A 150V power adapter. In usual cases we do not have 16A power output available to work with monitors. So please make sure you have 16A 250V plug point available. I had to purchase separate power cord to work with this monitor. Also, in the description it was not mentioned that it requires higher volt output plug which was a conflict because the product was not returnable only exchangeable.",4

"This monitor is magic!

I had an old Lenovo monitor (19'') which caused immense strain on my eyes and they would water frequently. I also have an high degree of myopia. I mainly do coding work and my laptop screen also strained my eyes very much, also being just 15.6''. So the 'eye-care tech' caught my attention and Benq being a trusted old brand, I ordered this (21.5'').

And my oh my, this monitor has worked wonders. I sit straight for 12-13 hours before the screen and my eyes don't feel a thing, earlier which used to water within 30-45 minutes of screen time!

The picture quality is crisp and vibrant and the brightness goes very high, but I always keep it in the Low-Blue Light mode which automatically reduces the max brightness.

I used the auto-brightness Eye Care feature based on ambient light sensing for a few days, which most of the time worked fine, but eventually shifted to manual mode as I preferred constant low brightness. But the colours are equally vibrant on all brightness levels.

I played some CS GO and was shocked to see the colour difference between my 2014 laptop (Lenovo Z50-70 1080p) screen and this monitor. I have hooked the monitor to the laptop via HDMI cable (not provided with the 21.5'' model, only VGA cable is provided). The response rate seems good enough, but I eventually stopped playing just because my laptop GPU specs aren't good enough.

The design is modern and sleek, slim-bezel.

Verdict: Perfect for the price, eye-care tech is a wonder.",5
"The monitor was damaged, screen broken from corner. See pictures.
Behavior of delivery boy was suspicious, he was in a rush and said "" agar damage hua toh change ho jayega"". Strange.",1
"I needed more space along with my macbook pro and after looking at the ratings I bought this. Most of the time I work using terminal app and font is not crisp, letters are faded and pixelated when used with small fonts. Color reproduction is awful. Now i regret the purchase as this can not be returned (replacement is available but that will not serve my purpose). Instead I should have purchased 24"" monitor. If you use very large fonts and internet browsing or entertainment is your primary purpose, then go for it.

If you want decent resolution on 27"" inch go for WQHD/QHD, but not full hd.",3
"UPDATE:
the monitor actually has a good firmware, you can customize 2 buttons the way you want it! haven't seen such feature anywhere, stupid marketing team should have highlighted it!
Now I can turn up and down brightness and change picture modes as I want it!

STILL NOT 4 STAR ABOVE SINCE IT HAS FLICKER ISSUES SOMETIMES

1st impressions as below, update above.
The product is marketed for its eyecare technology which they do by providing a blue light filter shortcut. but the most annoying thing is you cannot switch between different picture modes without this blue light filtering. and the worst part is you cannot turnoff the filter by clicking the same button instead you will have to go to the settings and navigate through a maze of options and change back to normal mode!",3
"This monitor is amazing. The color is just perfect. Many reviews said about the low brightness of the monitor. But I think its highest brightness setting is enough if you don't want your eyes to pop out of pain.
Gaming performance is 8/10. I played GTA V and Forza Horizon 4 on my Xbox on this monitor. Picture quality was just amazing. There was hardly any loss of frame rates. But if you are hardcore passionate gamer then go for higher refresh rate models.
The speakers are ok. If you are in a very quite room its ok to listen songs. Even a fan can disrupt the sound badly.
The four edges shows a very light black tint but it isn't visible when I look from another angle. So I guess its not a malfunction. The bezel could have been thinner though.
Build quality is solid too.
Overall go for it. Using it for 2 months+ now and no problems so far.
(The pictures are taken from a phone so there may be thin lines and grains.)",5
"So I required a Monitor for some Editing work and my budget was 10K.
After thorough research, I decided to go with this one.
For Rs. 8999, I think it was the best deal I got.

Here is my review after a week of its use.

Pros -
* First of all the price. you cannot get a good branded 24 Inch monitor at this rate.
* Colors are good and look good.
* Prompt to open and easy to install.
* Soft on eyes and does not give you headache even after long use.

Cons -
* It hangs sometimes.
* Mouse stops working when connected to Monitor, but occasionally.
* Brightness is not up to mark.
* The speakers are the worst that you can get. They are there just for the namesake. You need external speakers or use the other device.

I know that Dell Monitors are the best but they were quite pricey and I needed a big screen with good colour quality and a brand to back up with.

I have most of my expectations with this monitor
.
Despite few shortcomings, I think it is the best monitor in the market and you don't have to worry about buying it.",4
"BenQ ships this monitor with a LARGE 16A power plus which needs an AEH point. In India, such power outlets are only provided for Refrigerators, Owens, Geysers and similar electrical equipments that need high Amperes. A monitor does not need 16A. Why is BenQ shipping it with an unusually big power socket forcing customers to buy additional converters? Can BenQ or Amazon answer this question?",1
"Bought it for my Dell XPS laptop so that I can have a bigger screen. The build is solid and the cable management is great. The monitor stand is also very good as the monitor does not tip over easily. Max resolution is 1920 so don't expect it to have a greater area like a 4K monitor.

Less one star as I had to do a lot of calibration for colour. The inbuilt modes are not great. I had to switch to user defined mode and calibrate the colour a lot. Finally after 1 hour of fiddling with the modes and settings of the monitor, I was able to get the right colour.

Since it is an LCD monitor (not LED), the font on windows 10 look blurry. You need to set the cleartype option in the windows settings so that you get sharp fonts. Do not compare it with other high end monitors like gaming or photo editing. They are better but more expensive.

If you are looking for a bigger area to work on, buy a monitor which supports 1440 or higher resolution. Note the resolution also depends on the graphics card support. If you have a 4K monitor but the graphics card does not support it, any monitor will run on max 1920 resolution.

For daily use like word processing and programming, this monitor is great especially the cable management and back side design.",4
"Perfect for Work+ Entertainment purpose,

Picture quality is very nice and lot customisation available,

Very thin bezel apparently looks like bezel less

Low blue light is very useful for log time office works

Inbuilt speaker is not useful, evel Laptop speaker give a better out, but luckily its having 3.5 output, I combined with my old USB powered PC speakers,

I am using with MI TV Box the experience is awesome,

Initially i was planning for a LED smart TV, and now i am very satisfied with this setup,

I got it for 8500 from Prime day sale its still a better deal",5
"If you're looking for a monitor for programming/content consumption, this is highly recommended. I don't game at all so can't comment on the gaming experience.
The stand is sturdy and all types of adjustments are supported. The speakers are just a gimmick, they are just there and can be used only in case of an emergency. Picture quality and the brightness level is as expected. There were no IPS glow/ screen bleeding in my unit but you're advised to check for it as soon as your monitor arrives.

If you're planning to buy GW2480, I'd suggest investing some more money in this model, as the stand that this comes with comes very handy.",5
"Everything about the monitor is great- picture quality, size, brightness, height, everything.

EXCEPT- it comes with a stupidly big power cable- a 16A sized 3 pin instead of the usual 6A one. Would be very hard to find a spike booster that would fit it in. So was forced to run down to the store to buy a smaller power cable for the monitor. But thats just Rs.120. So not a big deal.",4
"Specifications mentioned on the product page are correct.
Pros: (total 10 points)
1. IPS panel with 27 inch screen and FHD resolution. (+2 points)
2. No flaws in external hardware design, round corners, even level surface mat finish (yes i do check these things) (+2 points)
3. Multiple connectivity with vertical access (means connection ports parallels to screen) and Wall mount options available. (+2 Points)
4. Anti Glare coating, No dead pixel, Great color depth and contrast ratio, average thin Bessel, good response time. (+2 Points)
5. Cable management provided in table mount and separate button at bottom for screen config. (+2 points)
6. it has in-built speaker, expect only to play smooth music. (+1/2 point not considering in monitor category)
Cons: (total -5 points)
1. they provided auto bright adjust sensor in front side (mid bottom) but for me it was annoying for two reason. (-2 Points)
a. its not upto the mark.
b. i missed basic elegant rectangle design look (i would suggest to make it detachable)
2. external Power light at bottom right corner but since its not on front side and not a hard light and can be compensated by keeping dark object beneath it (-1 point)
3. Manual color and screen mode adjustment required to suit your viewing distance and content. Presets were not that helpful. (-2 point)

Overall (+5 points), Product Quality and offerings are really good and worth the price.
Thanks to Seller and Amazon for great delivery experience..",4
"This monitor is great if you know what you're getting into.

First off let me start by saying that the factory settings on the monitor's features are not the best, the ""sharpness"" is cranked up the intelligent brightness control seems to be off so make sure you turn it on and set sharpness to zero or text can look funny.

At this screen size and viewing distance of about an arms length 1080p is just barely passable I really wish I could have gone for a 4k option which I highly recommend if you're gonna be coding on this thing. I paired it with a pivotable vesa mount to let me use it in portrait mode as well and it's going great.

This is not by any stretch of the imagination a gaming monitor that being said light gaming is acceptable on any display with reasonable brightness and >60 hz refresh rate

otherwise the massive screen real estate is much appreciated at this price point and the automatic brightness adjustment is extra cherries on top, my room has many windows and it gets bright in here during the day and dark at night and i don't need to fiddle with the brightness settings ever. and the glare from windows is practically non existant so kudos to Benq for making a great product",5
"Yes just like Xiaomi products. Cheap but good product.
I find the vga cable that comes along with this better than hdmi because it attaches firmly and vga cables are not as sensitive to degradation as hdmi. ( Strictly my opinion as I lost two within a few weeks).

You will appreciate the product.
I don't get ultra sharp text as I used vga cabel, I managed to increase the sharpness and it does the job for now. For hdmi you may get like picture quality like dell ( I haven't tried).

I would vote for this product on any given day.
Because it is
- cheap
- has decent anti glare
- good brightness
- excellent native blue light filtering
- good tilt adjustment angles vertically
- speakers are present ( haven't used them since vga doesn't transmit audio, if you use hdmi cable you will get the speakers to work)

This product is easily worth more than 8k.

We need companies building products like benq does for a moderate price.

If you need this for coding. Just hit the buy.
If need extra clarity, order a good hdmi cabel along side ( Amazon basics hdmi cable is good).

If your a gamer, then this review is not for you.
From what I heard on YouTube, it should do a good job but 60 Hz is the limit for refresh rate. So watch out if your games need more juice.

I hope this review of useful to you. Good day:)",5
"The picture quality is very low... I got this 2 weeks back and am not at all satisfied with the product... Taught the quality was bcoz of the settings but didn't have time to check that, by the time I realised that it was not the settings, the return window also closed...
Don't buy this monitor... May b u can go for a bit costly one and it may b good...",1
"Received in well condition 1 day before the estimated delivery date. Absolutely nice deal, I got it for 13.5K. Resolution is very good as I far as my needs, for office work and personal studies, this is the best fit at this price range.
1) Many built-in configuration menus to set the monitor as per your comfort.
2) Works well with Ubuntu and windows without any drivers
3) easy to configure
4) package contains all required items (monitor, stand, power cord, HDMI cable)
5) Stand is sturdy and the fittings are tight enough to hold the valuable firmly, and smooth enough to detach when needed
6) easy configuration menus and pre-configured menus to adjust backlit according to activity (multimedia, surfing, reading, office, etc).
7) sufficient wide screen for developers, regular office work, reading ebooks.
8) Picture quality is awesome for my requirements",5
"Amazing quality product delivered at this cost backed up with super Amazon delivery....what went well....
1. The pricing.
2. Multi inputs to include HDMI, VGA and even audio in.
3. Built in speakers that dont clutter the desk.
4. Screen size...maxx screen availabilitywith smallest bezels at this pricepoint
5. Beats my HP 22es monitor hands down with amazing quality, sharpness and eye control tech.
6. Wall mountable..
7. Wire organiser design that handles wire outlet so neatly.

Cons

1. No wallmount provided.
2. Not so slim in looks, but the same is not noticeable at all.
3. No separate audio cables or HD cables provided, has only VGA and power chord supplied with the package.

Overall a great affordable product with features akin to a high end LED monitor that easily cost 15K or more.",5
"I was a SAMSUNG Monitor user from long time. Initially I had SAMSUNG CRT monitor and after that LCD monitor 18 inch one. I used them for many years. After lots of research on internet I decided to buy this Benq monitor. But, after using it for more than 1 month, here are my opinion about this monitor.

PROS :-

- Looks and Build quality is awesome.
- Cable management at its best. If your monitor is going to be visible from backside also, then you should definitely buy this monitor.
- 2 HDMI Ports is a advantage.
- Brightness auto adjustment sensor is also very good addition and its works perfectly. After using this you will get used to it and it is very difficult to go back again.
- Stand is very sturdy and simple yet stylish.
- Overall Image quality is good considering this is the cheapest IPS LED Full HD monitor.

CONS :-

- If you are a tech person then you are NOT going to like its Display quality. It is good but NOT excellent. Overall I am NOT happy as I am a tech person. For normal people this is a very good display.
- Only VGA cable is provided in the box and NO HDMI cable. This is really SAD. Quality of image from VGA cable connection is Average. Strangely it is showing some flickering on screen which is NOT good. I don't know it is only for my unit or everyone is facing it.
- Factory Color calibration is NOT at all good. You have to adjust many settings according to your requirement.
- After connecting with HDMI cable I observed that it is showing too much whiter shade in black areas which is NOT good. It was not the case with VGA connection for same settings.
- If you use it on User Defined Picture mode then it shows nice colors and deep blacks.

Conclusion:-

If your budget is strictly low and you want good monitor, then only buy this one. Or I strongly suggest you go with LG monitors.",3
"This monitor is cool in design with very small/thin border (which I usually prefer), picture clarity is good and size is big enough for editing works relating to photos, music or video (I'm not into games - no comments). The monitor speaker is just another add-on feature, thought it's not great. But I hardly use/rely on monitor speaker and it doesn't matter much.

Delivery is excellent - item delivered the next day even though I don't subscribe prime membership.

However, one issue I faced - the original item was somehow defective - only flash screen displayed but somehow works again. To ensure that I bought a non-defective item, I have requested for a replacement. Amazon as well as the seller sent a brand new replacement item immediately, which is working fine now. So, this issue is deemed to be resolved immediately.

Overall, it's worth buying at this price range.

About the durability and any pros & cons that comes along, I'll try to review once again after some time - at least after 6-12 months of use.",4
"I was looking for an economical monitor to connect my work computer to work from home . This monitor fits my requirements very well . I paid 9.5k which seems to be more than what other reviewers have paid ... but it serves its purpose well .. the item was received promptly . The monitor works out of the box with my Windows 7 enterprise , Windows 10 and MacBook Pro 2019 laptops and I did not need to install the monitor drivers .",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Freedom sale: my first benq monitor, first impression (keeping the price in mind) ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù picture quality is the best you can get in a 8k monitor.
I know a lot of people would rather go with LG because of its name specially in India but then you wouldn‚Äôt know if you don‚Äôt try the other brands.
I wanted to have a 24‚Äù monitor, and this one is a beast both look wise and the price wise.

Monitor is bright enough.
I spoke to benq support and they said my monitor has three year of home visit warranty which is a plus point.
Go for it guys.
F&D sound bar is what I am using with this monitor and it‚Äôs pretty good to the ears",5
"I am using this as my second monitor - to replicate the dual-monitor setup at office. This is my 2nd BenQ monitor - the first one was bought over 6 years ago, but was TN type, with poor viewing angles and marked color shift when viewed from any angle other than straight ahead. The older monitor works otherwise, but the control panel buttons are misbehaving now. I am unable to change many of the settings, including Blue light.

This monitor, being an IPS panel, does not suffer from any of these shortcomings. The images are very crisp, clear and with natural colors. It has a wide viewing angle, being an IPS panel. Having blue-light reduction feature helps reduce strain on the eyes. The design is very slim and sleek - very think bezels. It supports full HD resolution.
The screen has matte finish, so there is no issue of glare.
Note: the monitor stand supports only vertical/side-ways adjustment - there is no height adjustment. You will need to pay more if you need this feature.
I use it for office related work mostly, video conferencing, and occassional entertainment - watching YouTube or videos.
I have not used it for gaming and have no experience evaluating it for gaming purposes.
All in all, this a very good buy, perfectly suitable for average users.",5
"Over the past 1 year, I've bought this monitor thrice.
I'm using a 4 desk setup, and till now, everything was fine.

Now, when I purchased this monitor yet again (same one as before)
I got a huge power socket with it, unlike ever before.

It's as huge as the one used for geysers, ovens and AC. It won't fit into my spike guard, or any other switch in my room.

I'll have to either install a new switch, or replace the power cord.

The first two times when I'd purchased, this wasn't the case and I received proper cord that'd fit into normal Indian sockets.",5
"The monitor is what you pay for... The screen is too bright with very poor contrast for any night time work. The contrast is soo bad that to see anything dark clearly, you have to crank up the britghtness. This means you cant work in the dark or night time.
The whole idea of LOW BLUE LIGHT and eye strain etc is defeated if you screen is too bright.
The speakers are a joke, my 5 year old laptop has better speakers. and a monitor DOES NOT NEED speakers.
This feels more like a bad TV than a good monitor.

All said, i still bought it because it was cheap, and have a great DELL monitor i can use for low light performance.",2
"I must be using Laptops for decades and never had any complain. But with my advance age of 70+ those small fonts do strain my eyes, when my daughter from USA, advice me to use an additional larger monitor for better viewing. I did some searching to select a proper monitor , variables being Size, Technical specification, Brand Name and of course, Price. Finally i selected BenQ, Model GW2780, 27""monitor. Price of around INR 13,000/- is alright and Amazon supplied the same very fast. Packing was excellent and assembly instruction very user friendly. Though it is having an elaborate online User's Manual and tons of instruction, i found it very simple.....just plug and play!",5
"Bought the monitor(GW2480) for wifey when she started working from home. She is not into gaming, and just needed a big monitor which is easy on eyes. Had the monitor for almost two months, she could stare into the monitor for hours without complaining (and that's a win in my book)

Deducted two stars due to the customer service experience, and not giving us a cost effective repair solution which resulted in more e-waste (we had to request a paid service since the LED panel cracked due a mishap, s**t happens when you have an unsupervised toddler running around the house).

BenQ customer service is a joke. Usually, there won't be any response when you try calling their toll free number (once, I got the message saying that the incoming calls are not allowed to their toll free number!). None of their local service centres listed in their website answers the phone. They have no record regarding the service request I made via their website (I got a confirmation mail). Finally when I did talk to service personnel via his personal phone, he quoted a repair charge which is almost equivalent to a new monitor price since they have to import the LED panel from Taiwan (or was he trying to get rid of me since it was a Friday evening :D The monitor is going straight to recycling eventhough it‚Äôs less than three months old and still in warranty period :-|

Below are some of the takeaways:
* Very nice monitor for your everyday use, BenQ got it right with their ambient light settings and low blue light technology
* Unlike some of the Samsungs and LGs out there, picture is not very vibrant
* Don't expect too much from audio dept; you are buying a monitor, not a sound bar
* When you buy this monitor, you pay for the hardware and not for the customer service

ps: we already ordered a BenQ 27 inch monitor",3
"After a lot of research, I found this monitor. It is perfect for regular reading and my office work. I was earlier thinking to go for 27'' model, but chose this rather. There's a lot of screen real-estate and the slim bezels are cherry on top of the cake. I really am impressed with how good the product turned out to be. If you are into content creation, video editing, media creation, or you are coding enthusiast, you would appreciate the product. Also I have seen the most reviews of this product on YouTube, and you can see people praising Benq for creating such a nice product.
The only drawback that I could notice was ghosting effect if you've kept the picture mode to be dynamic, but the product is well priced, and you cannot expect much from a 60hz IPS panel.
If you're going from a 16 inch to a 24 inch, you will not regret it. Peace!",5
"1. Anti-glare is awesome. Zero eye strain.
2. Buy 24 / 27 inch only. Even these sizes will seem small after a weeks use.
3. Has speakers.
4. Adaptive Brightness
5. Headphones & Mic Jacks

Cons
1. Max Audio is quite low",5
"Actual mrp price Rs. 8990, overall good to use it as extended monitor for office work. Have different picture modes, eye care with brightness intelligence, low blue light with multi options. You can safely assume there are no speakers in this, even though they exists. Point to note - Made in China, Manufactured for Taiwan BenQ",4
"I have been using it for last one week and it has all the features mentioned in the description. it is Flickr free it has auto brightness. It is the best monitor if you have to spend a lot of time in front of your system. It has less blue light compared to other monitors once you go into reading mode it completely gets rid of blue light.

Now coming to speakers, They are basic, you can just listen to the audio, they‚Äôre not meant for listening to music. They are loud enough if you are in a closed environment.

I don‚Äôt know about gaming experience because I don‚Äôt play graphic intensive games.

One more observation, auto brightness don‚Äôt go too low when there is no light around and you can‚Äôt decrease it manually when it‚Äôs in auto-brightness mode, that‚Äôs a bit annoying.

Overall it‚Äôs a bang for buck.",5
"I would have given this 5 stars if not for the first 3 faulty monitors i received. First order- 1st one showed vertical lines and flickering after 2-3 days, replacement came which developed vertical and horizontal lines by 6th day. Replacement was returned and I ordered once more ( because I liked the monitor and there were a lot of good reviews). Second order -(3rd monitor) -- screen started flickering after a few days, I thought I'd just return this and go for the 24inch one, but amazon said only replacement was possible. The replacement (4th monitor) has been running fine so far (3 weeks now). I should also mention that the first 3 monitors came in just the benq cardboard box while the last monitor had pretty good plastic wrapping over the cardboard box.. I wonder if the first 3 were products returned by other customers..

Monitor review
Pros- Price, Vesa mount
ports (2x hdmi, 1x VGA), audio out/in ports
Speakers- Nothing special, but for me its fine for watching random youtube videos, pretty useful when you can't be bothered to put on the headphones. helps in cutting down headphone usage a bit i guess
Auto brightness - not as sensitive as phone screen, but works...
Low blue light mode- Good but, might be easier to use night mode button in windows 10 than to reach out to press the button on monitor
customisable buttons x3, ( i've assigned low blue light mode, brightness and input source to them)

Cons-
Only vga cable provided (would have been better if it was hdmi)
Power cable is a bit short, not a problem if you're not using a mount. Since I'm using those gas spring mounts, I have to put my UPS on the desk to move the monitor freely without stressing the power cable.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Bought 2 of these monitor in October. Worked perfectly fine for couple of weeks, afterwards screen started flickering. It was occasionally in the beginning now it has become more frequent. Amazon did not offer any support as it was past 14 days instead asked to contact Benq. When lodged the complaint with Benq then flickering stopped as they take more than 2 days to respond. After they closed complaint it started again. Completely frustrating and very annoyed with this purchase.",1
"Needed a monitor after getting eye strain for almost 2 week, didn't had to be fancy or gaming type.

Have been using for 1 week now , 1st day eye strain was there but haven't noticed much eye strain since last 4 dys. Didn't find adaptive brighness too useful as it is more bright than what I needed.

Went with manual mode as I keep brightness minimum. Blue light filtering is good. Overall good for regular office type work where you have to look at screen all the time.",5
"Absolutely loved the purchase. I am so glad I purchased it before the lockdown was announced and my WFH just got way better due to this.
The autobrightness setting on this is a 5/5 and I am super thankful for it as I also use this using dim lights in my room.
Overall its a quality product and colours and contrast and overall viewing angles are the way you'd want. I specificaly use it for work and watching movies so I couldn't have asked for more!

The brightness sensors work really well and I'm impressed with the price tag amazon offers (bought it for 12.4k).
If you are looking for something for daily use (non-gamers) like for work or watching movies, this is the best out there.",5
"It's extremely well built with very sturdy stands and frames.

The picture is optimised to go easy on the eyes than looking good. It's great for office use, reading etc, but not good for any multimedia usage. The black levels are not very black. It feels more red due to the always on blue light filter.
Not very good for gaming too due to a little washed out colors and average response time.

Antiglare is great, it very good for reading especially when using windows greyscale.",4
I bought it for my office use. The one with height adjustable. You have to spend rational 1500 rs for mount . So I bought this one to avoid nuisance and for looks. As for the picture quality. It's not the best but decent enough. I'm able to output 4k video through my laptop. And it's probably upscaled 1080p..Sound is a bit low end. Audible in 3 feet radius. No boss whatsoever. Just normal speaker sound. Overall good buy because of eye caring feature and height adjustment,5
"i purchased this monitor and the internal panel was damaged within 3 months. after long follow up for 2 months. i got reply from customer service that it was broken by external force ..they never replied to my follow up emails. the company said enginner will visit site but he never did. i also followed up with amazon regarding the issue. although their service is generally good, i did not receive any reply from amazon regarding the issue despite follow ups . maybe because it was out of return / replacement period.

although there is no visible damage in display, its not covered by warranty. the cost of the panel is same as the new monitor (rs. 8000). besides, they are not available in india. hence i will be cautious of buying benq again. while it was working the display quality was good but after sales service was disappointing. i purchased another dell monitor from amazon.",2
"fabulous monitor I have come up across from few years. It's Eyr Care technology saves eyes. Sensors works excellent. I see the strain on my eyes is reduced after startin using it.

Please note my above view is from a professional working prospective sitting in front of system for around 12 hours a day. It looks solid and heavy, this indicates long term durability. Surprised of this being available at around 8k. Means a lot is coming in technology for less price.",5
"Monitor started to flicker very badly after 6 months with moderate usage.

I got this monitor on November 2020. I have been using this monitor only for office usage due to current WFH. Around 8 hrs per day on average and no usage on weekends. The monitor was working fine for 5 months. All of sudden, one day, screen started flickering very badly.

I tried all initial trouble shooting steps and nothing seems to help. I have dropped a mail to Benq support today on 5th April 2021. I will update if there is any response and If I can edit the review.",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 First i was confused between Lg, hp, and benq. Then when it comes the versatility and performance i believe benq is best brand not only for this one but all kind of of your monitor requirements.
Price might be 500-1k higher in similar range, but its worthy.everything like wall mount, audio in and out, vga, power cable with out adapter, cable management is there.
What i got:
1.Black levels are almost like oled, its great for an ips panel (see video).
2. Covers RGB, low blue light mode is great. Almost retina from 2 feet.
3. Benq is solid buid, low weighing monitors (asus) shake even on using buttons.
4.Recommended for binge watch and surfing and PPT and assignments stuff.
5. Very great use for TN dispaly laptop extension.
If you have 9k , don't think twice just get it.

Ps: *used asus vz229 no audio out no wall mount.
Used lg 24 inch, got burn screen issue in two years.

Only Con is sound is low but accepted as its a monitor not tv.",5
"I am writing this review after a month of usage.
Pros
1. Ideal size for doing office work. Eye care feature with low blue light (reading mode) is a plus.
2. The main feature is the height adjustable stand. Helps in getting the most ergonomic position thereby avoiding neck pain.
Cons
1. Speaker is very weak. Laptop speaker is better.
2. Headset port is for speaker/listening only. The port cannot be used for mic feature of the headset. So I still need to attach my headset to laptop.",4
"2 Weeks Review
If you are looking for 27inch 1080p Full HD with Affordable Price Range. This is the Best in the class available go for it as other competition are in high price range Benq is one of the best in monitors. Suitable for WFH Office and watching Movies.
Pros
-> Got the product Delivered on Time with proper Packing from Amazon .
-> No Dead pixel seen on the product and working perfectly fine.
-> Installation and Usage are easy. It comes with Power cord and one HDMI to HDMI cable.
-> IT has inbuilt Speakers . Works Well if u are attending Meetings or Watching Movies when u connect your monitor to the Laptop. Helpful for long hour meeting so u can avoid connect head phone or laptop speakers.
-> BenQ Brightness Intelligence. Good and Nice feature works well and get adjusted based on the surrounding light ambience. Working on Type C display to DVI port to Monitor and HDMI port.
-> Little hesitant for 1080p for 27inch where we may end up seeing pixels. But its other way around for normal Movie watching and Office work you will not see those

Cons
-> Monitor has only HDMI, display Port and VGA port and Audio in.
-> If you are planning to have 2 laptops connected or multiple pc then you may end up to have port availability on the Laptop of PC to have HDMI or display port or VGA.
-> VGA has the limitation of only Video output.
-> Display ports are not available in recent laptops they have either Type C or HDMI only . So you may end up spending addition 1500rs for type C to Display Cable if you are planning to add mutiple monitor with 1080 p and Audio \video.
->Note: HDMI to DVI cable . PC HDMI port to DVI on monitor doesn‚Äôt work with Passive cables. Make sure you get the correct cable or adapter as the cable is not dual way support. only one direction it works.",5
"Purchased to use it in my dual monitor setup and it works great. The picture quality is very good, especially for the price, and after the calibration the images looks almost as good as on my 20K+ LG Ultrawide monitor. There's no issues viewing from sides as well. The thing bezel design also makes it attractive, especially for a multi-monitor setup. The anti-glare coating is also a good thing. It takes 3-4 secs extra to turn on when compared with the LG. There are many configurable options and adjustments to be made, but using the buttons are not very easy. A joystick based navigation control would've been better. There are inbuilt speakers, but they are a big let down. Should is muffled and even a ~1000 INR Bluetooth speaker will produce better sound. If you are buying it for media playback or gaming, better go for separate speakers.",4
"Pros:
1. Speakers (Hardly any others have)
2. HDMI ports 2 (No other in this price segment)
3. A good screen and sturdy stand
4. Auto brightness adjustment sensor

Cons:
1. Useless VGA cable (after 2019 which laptop comes with VGA port??) HDMI cable is must.
I tried using type-c to VGA adaptor, monitor works but speakers do not work.
2. Not so great speakers (don't think of using it as TV)
3. Backlight bleed all over (typical IPS)
4. HDMI ports are very near, cannot put a cable and fireStick together (2 cables will work easily)

It could have been really handy if it had USB ports, but no !

I bought this on sale, costed me Rs. 6750, worth the money, I am going to keep this despite of cons but due to the pros. I would recommend buying if you are ok with these cons.",3
"I bought this monitor when it became obvious I would be working from home for quite some time.

The 27"" display is large enough, it's perfect for providing enough screen real-estate and the need for an extended laptop monitor is not required at-least in my opinion.

The monitor has a light sensor below the BENQ logo which can adjust the brightness, but it is not useful for me at-least as my seating position does not have much of varying lighting conditions. Others may find it useful though. Please remove the plastic film over the light sensor so that it works properly.

This monitor is a very good option to consider for those who are going to use it for regular home - multimedia usage and office work.

Overall, happy with the purchase and great buy for the price.",4
"Earlier delivery and packaging was good even though there was a small tear on the outer delivery box, inside was packed with adequate thermocol, hence no damage to the product. Got monitor, HDMI cable, Power cable and monitor stand in the package.

It is very easy to assemble meaning connecting the monitor to the stand, I did it myself. That way, it is very user friendly.You can tilt the monitor but can't adjust the height.

This is good if you are into photo and video editing and requires a good monitor on a tight budget. It is IPS panel and LCD screen. It has one HDMI port, so you can cast using fire TV.
There are Readermode, multimedia mode etc in the monitor with preadjusted settings. I use it with my desktop and cellphone. Backlight bleeding is very less. Just play with adjustments and which one you are satisfied with. I am using for 4 days now and I had used auto settings, but I feel the light green color is excessive(may be it's just me) especially on skin tones, you can try adjusting it manually.

There are inbuilt speakers with this monitor(I decided to purchase this model because of that )but the speakers' sound is very feeble. It is better to connect an earphone /external speakers to the monitor through the audio in port.

This is a value for money monitor. Love it.",4
"The first product I received has an issue i.e a dark or dull area near the bottom right corner. I thought this is a defective one and ordered a replacement.

However I was shocked when the second product I received has the same issue in the same spot.

Somehow this issue is not present in the logo/loading screen. It is also barely noticeable in dark movies while too much happening on the screen. But is definitely an issue in white scenes or softwares.

I have attached picture of this issue. This issue is more prominent when you you put the brightness less than 40 or so.

Below is the detailed review of this product:

Pros:
> Nice bezels
> Cable management system
> Build quality feels durable
> white to black separation is good
> Colour looks ok after some tweaking

Cons:
> Brightness uniformity is a big issue. Some part of the screen looks dull or darker than others.
> Black is not pure black but grey like
> There is some back light bleed issue in dark environment but ok as per the price point
> Brightness is too high even for 0 settings. Not at all suitable for working in a dark environment.

Final thoughts:
If you are going to work on creative apps like Photoshop or some other editing softwares then please don't buy it. For watching movies and other entertainment purpose it is ok.

On every white screen like Google Chrome or Microsoft office softwares you will notice the dark area on the screen due to the brightness uniformity issue.",2
Picture quality is very good. Loved it. Very classy and height adjustable feature is very good. It suits me and for my kid as well. I bought 24 inch and it is good enough for dual screen . It is good for working long hours,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Purchased this monitor, a few days ago, with the height adjustment capability as I have a small-medium work table on which I can raise the height of the monitor and place my MacBook/laptop in the gap between stand and screen (Pic attached). Go for height adjustment option if you have less space on table to manage laptop/keyboard and mouse or you need a tilt/rotating monitor display.

After 3 days of using this monitor for my everyday office work and watching the OTT (Netflix, Prime, Youtube mostly) content, here is what I think are the pros & cons of this monitor.

Display:
1. This is a full HD 1080p display the HD content looks manageable. Videos content from OTTs can be easily enjoyable.
2. Text doesn't look pixelated and for the programming/coding the portrait mode is just awesome.
3. Gets enough bright during the day even while facing direct sunlight. During the night, brightness intelligence kicks in and reduces the blue light emissions.But it's hardly noticeable.
4. The viewing angles aren't that impressive while watching video contents, but one can be comfortable working on the text, docs and excels.

Sound:
1. Well, with 16 watts built-in speakers, one cannot expect a premium sound quality however I can easily manage my office Skype calls without headphones and the sound is clear.
2. When listening to OTTs or video/audio content the sound is decent enough but it's just monotonous. (let alone the HQ & Dolby). Sample video clip attached.
3. I have connected my JBL flip 3 bluetooth speaker with 3.5mm audio input to this monitor and it solves the purpose of watching/streaming video content to a great extent.

Ports:
1. Has a HDMI port, a display port and a VGI port. (Sadly, no USB ports). A 3.5mm audio input port through which one can connect external speakers. (My JBL Flip 2 works like a charm).
2. Comes only with a HDMI to HDMI cable (1.5ft) and a power cord in the box.

Flexibility:
1. The height adjustment option makes this monitor an excellent choice near 10K and makes the competitors run for their money with screen rotation, 30-40% tilt.
2. As the display can be raised up-to ~ a feet, it creates a good gap between the stand and screen beneath which I easily keep my PC and my phone on a Techzere laptop stand. (Saves a great amount of space for my keyboard and mouse).
3. The monitor(with height adjustment) is arguably heavy with about 6kgs of weight and my work table is wall mounted hence I am not sure I can let this monitor, along with other accessories be as is. So consider the weight, should you often tend to displace the monitor from time to time.

At 11k, I find this a good addition to my WFH set-up, not good for video editing or 4K content. Only sad point is that this is MADE IN CHINA.",4
"The two in-built speakers are nothing but a joke. Even if place myself right up close to the the monitor (one foot from the monitor...the only thing between me and the monitor is the keyboard), the audio is very low. The volume from this monitor set to max is not even 20% from the single speaker of that of my mobile phone (Redmi Note 7) placed exactly at the same location.

I am not expecting a TV like volume from this. But the speakers are not even audible. I need a monitor with built in speakers to go through some videos etc quickly without having to connect my sound bar etc.

For such an awful speaker volume, they should not describe the product as one with built-in speakers. I am going to have to return this.

I am not going to comment on the picture quality at this point because I have not validated it enough as I have made up my mind to return it.",2
"As a monitor, have nothing to complain at all. Looks elegant and have nice picture quality.

The only thing I did not like are the in-built speakers which are very poor quality and also too low in volume. I did not expect deep bass, but at least the voice/treble should have been louder. We can watch news or likewise on youtube, when sitting within 3 feet of monitor, but not further. And not suitable at all for music or movies. I take one star off for the poor speakers.

The brightness intelligence feature: The sensor captures direct/directional light falling on it, and not room ambient light. My room is such that the room light (LED tube light) is directly behind me, and a slight shadow falls on the monitor's light sensor, such that the monitor thinks the room is darker than it really is, and dims the brightness. So finally, had to keep the sensor auto brightness feature off.",4
"Review of BENQ GW2283 22"" Full HD Eye-care Tech PC Monitor -

Pros -
1. Nice thin bezel monitor giving more display area. Just right size for daily use for office work etc
2. Full HD resolution is good for reading and office work on spreadsheets, etc.

Cons -

1. Bought this monitor mainly for its proprietory Eye-care technology, but didn't notice any change in display despite change in ambient lighting. Spoke with their CC who simply gave phone no of their ASC who wasn't of much help either. Managing to use it as a simple Full HD Monitor.
2. Doesn't come with any CD with drivers (as it is for 24"" Monitors of BENQ)
3. Had I known about absence of Eye-care tech, I would have preferred to buy a PC Monitor with higher refresh rate (75Hz or more) as this is a 6-7 year old Monitor with 60Hz refresh rate only
4. Using this Monitor with ""Low Blue Light"" setting turned on is with Brightness at 100% and Contrast at 50%, which is too high and strains the eyes. Had to disable this and choose 'User' mode and adjust Brightness and Contrast to my preferred levels, as ""Low Blue Light"" or any other option (Standard, Web Surfing, Reading) doesn't allow adjustment of Brightness or Contrast. This should have been allowed in other options too.
So, am now using this Monitor in 'User' mode with very low levels of Brightness & Contrast, and choose Night mode in my Windows 10 Settings if I want to reduce Blue light exposure. Seems this is the best option for all-day users like me",2
"Very useful product. I like two HDMI ports, one I use to connect Amazon Fire TV or Google Chromecast while other one I use to connect with my laptop to use two screens. I connect my CPU in VGA port. Two 3.5 mm jacks in the monitor are also useful, I just connect external speaker with monitor to watch programs and movies using Fire TV or Google Chromecast without using CPU. The internal speaker inside the monitor is of no use because not much sound from it.",5
"Audio output speakers in the monitor is not working properly. very feeble output. Same sound at 20% and 100% volume adjustment., provided in the Monitor. Tried every adjustment in the system by maximising output from the system. When connected to external speaker from the headphone output of Monitor, getting good volume. Please analyse and see whether it's a defect in the speakers.
All other features are very good and I liked the product.",3
"The body and screen finish feels smooth and premium
Sound is properly enough for a 10/12 room if viewing 6ft away
The frame Looks stylish and edge to edge
Picture quality is fine, while the benq brightness adaptive sensor didn‚Äôt seem to change at different condition
The image is sharp, display is bright, colours are pretty fine
Eyes never strain even after working 3-4 hrs straight.

Overall it‚Äôs a better option than other regular monitors. Happy with my purchase",5
"It‚Äôs bright , doesn‚Äôt hurt your eyes Though.
Love the height & size.
It‚Äôs got speakers , so good for Town Hall meetings / Webinar‚Äôs ( outputs not crazy loud, but it‚Äôs good if you have a quiet room )
It can be tilted , so that‚Äôs surely a good thing.
And lastly it‚Äôs got a matt style screen - so no reflections or glare .

Just one word of advice - this isn‚Äôt going to wow you , so I‚Äôd say office work or for students. Don‚Äôt think this is best suited for gaming .",5

 I bought 2 monitors on this last Aug, But one of them keep on getting issues like Horizontal pixel lines and flickering problem. So I thought it's my bad luck that I got a manufacturing defect product. So I returned it and requested for a replacement.
The Amazon shipping was too good that the replacement came in 2 or 3 days .. But again this worst horizontal pixel line popped up into the replacement monitor after 1 week. So I returned the replacement monitor too... I wonder what happened to benq.. that their monitor is not even lasting 2 weeks! I tried it 2 freaking times coz I like Benq... Now I'm in confistion that I should again go for benq or I should find some other brand ... Please suggest if you guys got any good ones other than this..because God already gave me 2 chances ... I don't wajt to spoil the third one tbh",2
"Excellent monitor. I've been using this product for about 1 month, and i must say its awesome. Installation of this product is super easy, even a small child can do it (if he has some common sense). Picture quality is average - but anti-glare is awesome ! (hardly has any glare). Bonus point for this monitor is that it has various modes such as office mode, multimedia mode, reading mode(which gives least strain to the eyes). So its a very feature-ful monitor with auto-brightness sensor (which works well) and also low blue light mode for very long duration of usage. Basically i am very happy with this purchase, probably can't get better than this at this price.",5
"Liked the monitor very much though it is not even a week. The clarity is too good, clear and crisp display. Some reviews say that the brightness is low but at least I did not face that issue and to me, brightness is pretty good. Sound is very low though from the built-in speakers but then I already have good quality speakers attached to my PC, so that is not an issue at all. Yet to try the Audio out with headphones to check the sound quality and loudness.

Overall a good buy, maybe if I would have waited until the mid-July sale, I'd have got some discount. I paid 10,575 which probably is ok if not towards the higher side.",5
"If you are using any Apple products like macbook pro or ipad pro which have only usb type c ports then this is not the product you should even think of it.As per benq guys below is what I received

As this monitor is not having USB C Type ( USB 3.1 ) port, you cannot connect the Apple i Mac Products and you may connect through a USB C Type to HDMI Converter but the compatibility cannot be guaranteed. In the market lot of Converter are available, some may compatible and some may not compatible so customer needs to check and confirm the compatibility before purchasing the same.

Even when I m using original Apple connecter is doesn't support that. So if you want to risk your machine and try want to try any XYZ conneco then go ahead.",1
"Ordered monitor for home office. Nicely packed,delivered with one black HDMI cable and power cord.
Easy to mount on table stand and stable on table.
Picture quality is good with good sharpness, brightness, can spend longer hours to read, code, browse.
Comes with four viewing modes for read, office, browse and movie.
Set office or read mode for home office to reduce stress on eyes.
Best viewing experience on all angles, anti glare.

Textured plastic body of good quality.
Initially want to buy 24 inches 27 inches may be too big! To get office experience 27 inches is necessary, can split screen to view two applications without opening laptop.

Comes with three years warranty, can be checked at BenQ site with monitor serial#",5
"I bought it around August 2020 so it was the mid of COVID & this was at the right price in comparison to other 27"" monitors (Rs.14000). All others were around 20k then. There have been absolutely no issues with the monitor. It serves it's purpose well. The Read mode is very easy on the eyes & you don't need to manually change a lot of settings. In comparison to speakers of other monitors too, this one's speakers does a much better job. Definitely a must buy, if I need another monitor again.",5
"If you are looking for eye protection/ night mode options.. it has multiple option to chose from .. has auto sensor light adjustment feature.. comes with multiple hdmi and other ports are useful..

Drawback - if you have to switch screen brightness manually you will need to reach out to screen and press almost invisible buttons to adjust.

Body build quality is rich and strong",4
"Great looker.

Excellent picture quality and there is no glare. Good rendition of pictures clicked with pro cameras of Sony, Fuji, Canon, etc. Very good for regular office work and other general routine. Probabably should be good for gaming and maybe watching movies, also.

First time am using Benq products and am impressed.",5
"The product is well built , Delivery was a bit slow. (took almost 1 week.)

But the product has good built It has a luxury feel to it, and has extra crisp viewing comfort.
It also has a tilt featuer (up and down) which is convenient to use.

The speakers are below average, but at this price its great to have them to simply watch you tube videos or normal windows sound.

I compared it with HP screens , and found that at the same price (or less) BenQ was having speakers as well.

So I went for this for regular office use.

The plastic quality is top notch and the look and feel looks undeniably premium.",5
"I purchased this Monitor a week back and happy with the performance. Little disappointed with it's speaker because sound is very feeble and not able to use it, so you have to purchase external speaker if you would like to use it for some purpose. As it meets my purpose So 5 star. I am generally using it for office work purpose, so no problem for me. As I need to work continuously for 9 hours it provide relax to my eyes. Thanks to this monitor's eye care system. Brightness sensor is working well and automatically adjust brightness as per surrounding . all wires are passing through it's stand holder, so no mess of wires on my desk. It's boarder-less look from all 3 sides makes it beautiful I found all features same as per Amazon's description about the product. Thank you.",5
"This monitor I bought it for my office work (coding) It is just a month old, it started showing a vertical line on the screen. Not sure this can be replaced now? Any suggestions?",1
"I got this monitor to use as an external display to my mobile workstation (thanks to Work from Home due to COVID -19). Delivery was fast, well packaged, thanks again to Amazon's service.
The Monitor is good enough for office jobs. With whatever setting I tried, I could not get pleasing picture quality from this. it is a full HD screen and connects over HDMI. I am not sure whether my tastes are spoiled by using iMac for over a decade! This monitor has built-in speakers, but not useful at all. However audio out provision is there which is good. There is a cable management provision, which is a nice thing to have.
Overall, I can rate only 3/5, though this is sufficient for office work.",3
"If I could go back in time I would definitely not buy this product. The picture isn't sharp, the brightness controls are very weird - even after turning off the in built eye care or whatever they're calling it, it's still not matching up to my smaller hp monitor",3
"After unboxing the first impression was very good as the screen size is huge. And after powering on I felt like its a movie screen. Just wow. Awesome picture quality and bright screen. You can open many windows and work at same time. I am doing my freelance job easily now. Also I am playing game on this monitor. If you are not a e-Sports guy (who plays competitive game tournaments) then go for it. It has wall mount option so if your table shorts like me you can hang it on wall. Plus you can watch tv on it, angle of view is really wide, and the Product is very slim. Got it at ‚Çπ12999/- loved it. Aweome üî•",5
"I had checked reviews of many monitors before buying opting for this one. I was looking for the following features: 28.3 inch full HD with wall mount option, tiltable screen, audio out port and in-built speakers. The BenQ GW-2480 has all these features and the price was the lowest. The audio-out port is important if you plan to use Firestick. The sound of the built-in speakers is low (as expected), The screen quality is great for my work (I'm not a gamer, so I cannot review that aspect). The menu options are easy to use and there are some useful settings that can be adjusted. The bezel is thin so it looks great and the plastic quality is great too.",5
"I got this Monitor for 12499( 27"" Model), and it has been a few months since I am using it.

It is used primarily for Office work, and for some gaming.

Pros :
Clarity : The texts are sharp and clear, and there is no issue with visibility. I do not have to peek into the monitor to read, like I had to do on the laptop.

Brightness : The monitor gets pretty bright. So much so that I keep it at 30% Brightness.

SIze : 27"" is a pretty good size.

Color Reproduction : Colors are pretty sharp, and you can select from multiple color profiles from within the monitor. I am currently playing Witcher 3 and the colors are splendid. Though this might not be a good monitor for FPS gaming, because of the response time 5ms. But it is good for games like GTA, Witcher, RDR that do not require precision.

Cons :

The speakers are pathetic. Even the HDMI Passthrough for Audio Circuit is pathetic. Speakers connected to laptop have much better audio that when connected to AUX port on the monitor. Though no minus points for it, since it is just an add on, and not a selling feautre.",5
"Bought this @13490rs(2020 june) ...which I believe is an amazing deal.
The picture clarity is just stunning.
Amazon packing was also very good.
Gaming is little difficult with this huge size otherwise watching HD/4k movies is just great.
Side bezels are very tiny, that make this display aesthetically pleasing.

ps: (Malayalam) Onnum parayanila adipoli :)",5
"I am writing this review after 1 month of usage. This monitor has two HDMI ports which is the biggest USP. You can use this as second TV. Just connect firestick or settop box. The next best thing is reading mode which makes the screen yellowish by reducing the blue light radiation just like in mobiles. Very good for kids. The inbuilt speakers are also good. It is loud enough for music and videos viewed from 1 to 2 mtrs. It has headphone output too. The display panel is IPS with very good viewing angles and a good response time. Good for games too. The build quality is also good and it looks stylish with very small bezel. My previous monitor was also Benq which lasted 12 years. I hope this one will too last that long. Just go for it. Note the 24"" version does not have 2 HDMI ports, it has 1 HDMI and 1 Digital Display. Hence if u want 2 HDMI ports then go for22"" monitor.",5
"My first buy of a BenQ product. Though I knew the Qisda the holder of this brand I have never worked on BenQ monitors before. I purchased seeing the flicker free and eye care ads on this product with a great pricing. Well the buy is not disappointing. The product looks and works exactly as advertised. Most plus are very little glare, and the auto settings feature. With auto-settings enabled, it adapts to the lighting conditions around and making it comfortable. The only caveat with that is, when switched ON, it starts with full brightness and you will need to look somewhere away anticipating that. In a second or two it will be brought in to control, but that should have been set in the other way - start with medium brightness/contrast level and then adjust it to optimal level. This can be fixed with a firmware update - I hope BenQ will have to address this as soon as possible. On the other hand, the sound on the monitor - just don't expect any good. You have two speakers for just to have it. It is not loud enough and not any good quality sound to hear from it as well.",5
"The picture quality is very good. 5 stars.
The Audio is useless. 1 star for it.

ONE issue with the viewing is that the screen adjustments are mannual. During the day time Eye care intillegence work, but during the night we have to manually reduce the brightness and the contrast to avoid straining the eves. So this has to be done every day, it's not worth the price. 2 star for it
Over all 3 star",3
"Brightness is good but the adjustment settings not brightness are for good.
Eye care working very fine
Screen quality according to price good but sometimes when you using Microsoft product like paint, word or other software some time you feel bluri view i think this because Microsoft software not full hd icons.

Overall conclusion 4/5 to this screen
Design i like and fliker technology fully working",4
"Full HD, Anti- glare, yes ! comparable to other great branded monitors. but 1 star less is because packaging includes a VGA cable.. NO HDMI CABLE ! So again i got to run to a shop to buy a HDMI cable...... and Sound quality is like those mini speakers about 3 to 4 decades ago that used to be available for walkman !!! If you love music, you'll NOT love these built in speakers !!! So please dont rely on these built in speakers to satisfy your ears...
I hope they start shipping it soon with HDMI cable instead.. thanks !",4
"It is a very good product for the price range of 9K. The adjustable warmth and light sensor makes it conducive for any ambient environments. Viewing angle is pretty good. Exterior finish is premium matte makes it look cozy. I have tried connecting with my set top box and the picture quality is awesome than my TV. Sound quality is not so bad with the inbuilt speakers. Overall I would rate 5 as it does a good job for the price range.

The only thing I feel on the negative side is that the height adjustment. This monitor leg supports only tilt angle.",5
"Nice monitor for occasional use, who wants big screen at cheap price.

But not advisable for regular use because of poor sharpness.
It has minor blur effect due to pixelation all over the monitor, which makes my eyes to strain much. Long use leads to eye pain.

Thanks.",3
"Keeping it simple

Pros
Good display with Antiglare screen.
Eye care option to reduce Blue Like (Some may not like that option).
The Stand equipped is easy to install and does not attach scratches.
The speakers are addons, though not powerful.
Liked the cable management enabled in the stand.

Cons
Power cable provided in 16Amps which does not fit most sockets. 16Amp cable to required for an LCD monitor. Had to replace it with a smaller one to connect to UPS.",4
"For the price, this monitor offers the best features.

For gaming, one might want something with less response time but this works for me as I play mostly casual ones.
Picture quality is good. Colours are vibrant.
Brightness is more than enough. I set it at 30 out of 100.

2 HDMI ports was the USP for me. And the IPS display was a must. No other monitor have it in this price range.

One HDMI for laptop extension and another for Raspberry Pi. This serves a real good purpose.",5
"This monitor is one of the best for it's price range. Although I am using it for just 1 month but still can say that the picture quality will not deteriorate. For normal work it is just awesome. You can watch High Quality movies also and it will run the video smoothly.
The issues with this monitor which I felt is that it's speakers are not that good. I prefer my laptop speaker over this monitor speaker.",5
"Absolutely loved the monitor! I was looking for a monitor under 10k which would serve the purposes for office work, gaming as well as entertainment and this monitor perfectly fits for the same.
Before buying this one I did an extensive research on the monitors available in the market but this BenQ model wins it.
Have been using it for more than a month without any issues.
It came in nice packaging and did not observe any damages.
The picture colours are truly awesome and very well defined.
The only thing that I find lacking is the option for an additional HDMI port as this has only one since I keep switching between my laptop and desktop. But that is not a major issue.
If you are looking for a budget all purpose monitor, I'll recommend this one for sure.
Note: Don't rely on the monitor speaker as they are actually of no use. You'll eventually have to connect external speakers.",5
"Got the 22in for my 4th grader son's online classes. Our 2nd Benq monitor. I trust the brand. Picture quality is decent and light bleeding is well within acceptable range for an entry level IPS panel. Looks good on the table with the slim bazel. The power cable that came in the box has a16amp plug top- for a monitor??? Don't remember ever seeing any personal computing hardware powered by a 16amp plug. No 16amp socket in house within reach, neither did I have a 5amp spare cable. To test the monitor I had to use the cable from my office setup. I am a little surprised by Benq's choice. Also they only included a vga cable and no hdmi. Overall happy with the performance but pulling 1 star due to mo hdmi supplied and the 16amp plug.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 BenQ monitor was really nice for almost a month. Reduced my headache that I used to get while using laptop. Modes (Multimedia, Web Surfing, Office and reading) are very useful. I always use reading mode for reduced blues. Only annoying thing is I've started observing a patch at bottom half of the screen. Hoping it will disappear automatically soon.",4
"Brought this product for setting up my home office during the lockdown.
Delivery was before time - Thanks a lot Amazon for this.
A 24"" monitor within the budget. Has modes for multimedia, web Surfing, Office and Reading and each mode controls the brightness for the purpose. Has good blue light filter and pretty sooting for eyes.
Has built in speakers, but don't expect high quality output. It's a very basic speaker. This device has a 3.5mm monitor jack as well.
There is some provision for angle adjustment.. But no height adjustment available. Would need to depend on monitor stands or using bulky books for height adjustment :)
Am not a gaming person.. Not sure of performance during games
Very happy with the purchase",5
"I like the monitor for the following cases.
1. The Monitor has 2 HDMI inputs. So can you the same monitor for gaming (PS4) and office work (secondary monitor) without plugging and unplugging wires.
2. The monitor has a Audio line in and Audio line out (3.5mm socket). Now i can connect the speakers directly to the monitor instead of connecting to every device I use the monitor with.
3. Bazel less look is amazing.
4. The monitor also has inbuilt speakers which can be useful in quiet rooms.
5. Wide angle viewing.",5
"The product I received is in very good condition. It is exactly as it was described by the seller in fact, it is even better.

I read some reviews, where people told of backlight bleeding, the monitor I got, I couldn't find any backlight bleeding (The were no damage too).

Also, it is good for gaming as long as you are an Average gamer with 1-4 GB graphics memory and you are ok playing in 59-60 fps then this monitor is very good.

Eye care technology is very good if you are sitting in front of it and reading stuff and watching videos.

'""Only thing is that after you get the monitor you have to enable the eye care feature in the monitor """"

Overall it is a very good monitor. : )",5
"One of the best monitors I've worked on.
Screen Size is just Perfect..
No Bezels at all and trust me this makes the experience so much better
Brightness level is perfect. It has some very good presets that you can try and use according to your use.
The sensor is also good but I would rather use the presets.
Sound is low and I wouldn't watch any movie with that sound. But yes its a good thing to have just in case your speakers fail.
No Pixel bleeding at all.. even in night use no strain on the eyes.
I would 100% recommend this product.
Its VALUE FOR MONEY.",5
"I got the delivery of the monitor today but the power cable plug is of the big size. The one meant for the 15 amps socket used for high power appliances like the geysers and heaters.
I believe it is a wrong delivery. I have never seen a monitor needing such a socket.

I am not able to use my monitor because of this in my room.",2
"Very good product, Its features of multiple input connections is really helping me i have connected my three laptops to it and it automatically detects the input of whichever is on and we can override by buttons to choose the source. Picture clarity is excellent. Only one issue is that in the nearby switches if any one switches off or on this monitor will restart .",5
"It no doubt that the monitor is good with its price range.
But if you want to use for 8 hours a day .
Go for Dell or some other company.
Don't look for cheap one and make same mistake as i did.
The monitor causes headache after few hours of usage which i never had with any other monitor.",3
"This is an excellent product. I knew it has no height adjustment and thought it'll not be a deal breaker, however now I can not reduce it's height (one can at least increase the height by putting some support at the bottom). If this is not a deal breaker to you, then go for it. Speaker quality is good. Audio clarity is not good for video calls since it seems it is optimized for multimedia audio (treble is not that great). Hence when I do not want to use headphone, I switch speaker to my laptop instead of this monitor.
The most imp factor to me was the eye care feature, which is working very well with this monitor. There was no eye strain once started using this monitor in spite of long working hours (I keep eye care always on, not just at night).",4
"Hello Everyone,

If you are programmer and looking for a monitor for work purpose , this monitor is not so good. Go for Dellp2419H.

After a lot for research ,I finalised two products . Benq24 and Dell p2419h. There are two problems with Benq as compared with Dell.
1. Stand : As compared to dell , this stand is not up to the mark. Dell stand is the best in the market. You can do what ever you whan to do and it supports it.
2. Display quality : Too much complex to adjust and not upto to the mark as compared with Dell.

Coders, programmers -> don't buy this , go for Dell.

Thanks.",2
"This screen deserves a purchase because:
- It's well built - buttons feel clicky, low wobble while moving around
- The stand is ergonomic and functional, providing great support.
- Cable management is smart. Compared to LG or Samsung, this helps my desk stay neater. Don't know why other products costing much more can't do a decent design for cable management.
- Has inbuilt functionality to dim or increase brightness depending on ambient light.
- DPI is sufficient. Im using as a secondary to a macbook, and it does not feel inadequate. My 24"" LG with maxx audio at work has poorer resolution.",4
"its june 2020 and they still give vga cable and CD, got defective blue line in screen. waiting for replacement.

I will update review once i get the replacement

Update: replacement works fine. It is a nice monitor. The eye care feature/auto brightness is disabled by default. Please remember to enable it.
The only complain is getting vga cable in box.
Update 2 speakers are very low quality.",4
"no need to search for other monitors. In this range almost all the monitors have same warranty, service and quality but here is the advantage of price. You can invest in other components like graphics card from save some buks from this pricing. I got it for 8500/- in diwali amazon sale.",4
"Probably I am one of those few people to get hands on both Dell 2419h & Benq GW2480T.

I must say that both of them are plagued with manufacturing defects, such as backlight bleeding and uneven rendering of colours. Typical Chinese with no quality control. Only went with them as there were no alternatives.

The backlight bleeds can be noticed on darker videos (especially on right side corners), and uneven colours can be noticed with white/grey backgrounds where some parts of screen may appear as yellowing and rest whiter.

This is my 3rd monitor after returns/replacements and still face the same issue. I thinking to retains this piece not because it's better than remaining ones, but rather because I'm tired of this replacement/returns process.

If you trust any local shop then I would suggest to go with it rather than online in amazon, because getting a good electronic product (especially displays) is matter of pure luck here.

Update:
Found dead pixel on bottom left part of screen. So enough compromises, returning it off.",2
"I had earlier my 24 inch HP LP2475w monitor. After ordering this 27 inch Benq monitor I thought it is a upgrade to my old monitor. But the pixels are so big that it can be easily seen. This was really downgrade for me. I am unsatisfied. My old 24 inch LCD monitor pixels was better.

The built quality is very very good compared to my another 22inch led dell monitor which you can see back of this monitor image. It is quiet heavy too. Speakers are normal, not loud.
It is good for students. Not so good for designers, small text editors and photoshop editors.

So guys please decide if you want to upgrade to 27 inch, think of at least 2k resolution.

Thanks for reading.
Hope it helps you to buy what you want,,,

 Update on 14th June : After writing my Last review on 3rd June I got a Call from Deepak (from BenQ HQ Gurgaon) very next day and offered to replace within a Week as they figured out my Monitor has some Panel issues. The New monitor received as a replacement works like a Charm. Kudos to BenQ team.

1st Review : 3rd June
[Refer the Video attached] When the new Monitor arrived it was working fine - however after using continuously for 6 month for WFH it started showing Rectangular Rings and Frequent Flickering around the Screen Border. I contacted the BenQ support and they said this issue is common with BenQ and it will go away after sometime. AND yes this issue did go after 3-4 hrs and screen as good as earlier. BUT after one this issue again came and nowadays it is too frequent which hampers the WFH productivity. This issue is so uncertain that it can came during you meeting presentation or while watching movies. Lets hope BenQ provides a replacement.",5
The picture quality is Amazing. Quality and color reproduction is Amazing. It is IPS panel with the most accurate color accuracy. The refresh rate is 5ms which may be a problem for some gamers. But until you are doing coding or movie or binge watch the refresh rate will never ever bug you. It is just visible when reading a running text ( who does read a running text ? Document file is stable always üôå still it soemone cares about it they can check that) good dark levels I use it with my laptop as its screen was not enough for me. The bezels are very very thin which is just awesome. Complete screen experience.,5
"Updated review after 10 months of use:

Pros:
-- Looks nice
-- Multiple connection options
-- Lower price compared to Samsung, LG

Cons:
-- Monitor started flickering within a year
-- Different colours started appearing around the screen on different times
-- Audio quality is very low and not practically usable. Even volume of my laptop/mobile is much louder than the volume of the monitor.",1
"Very Impressive monitor to help attend video calls and work from home. The volume of the built-in speaker is a bit on the lower side. But that is not an issue as with a good set of headphones or external speakers, it is addressed. I bought it mainly for working by connecting my laptop for which it is an excellent monitor. The piece that was delivered initially had a dead pixel. However appreciate the smooth replacement process in Amazon, it was perfectly handled. Kudos...!!! to Amazon....",5
"Great Product worth for the money.
this is for my Office work setup for 9++++ hours continues work , I have habit of dual monitor in Office, which was kind of missing from very long as I am WFH but as everyone know this so called WFH exhausted full day and night life, working in laptop continuously would not help me to get productive and making my back and eye tired,

now this armament will help me with good visibility and work potential.
Good quality of product form BENQ and very surprising Super fast delivery form amazon in the just next day of order for this Monitor.
very thin bezels and quality screen visibility
soft to eye and light for pocket when compare with competitor
monitor is adjustable from neck for up and down but not shift up and down which believe me you don't needed.
must recommend this product go for it and great service form Amazon",4
"I got my monitor today and it doesn't include HDMI. I'll have to spend extra and wait more now to use it.

Hate the experience even though I like the monitor. Have to wait more days now for the cable.

Who uses VGA now anyway?

Arrrghhh.

Edit: Been using it for few months now. Works flawlessly. Speakers suck a bit. But anyway who buys monitors for speaker quality?",4
"This is review after 14 days of usage (9-10 hours/day). I used this monitor for working from home. Also used it for casual gaming (medal of honor, Call of duty kind of games), Web-surfing and watching you-tube videos and movies.
Good points: Easy installation, HDMI cable received with the monitor, bezel less design gives a premium feel, brightness intelligence feature is good, eye strain is very less. color production is good.
Bad points: haven't really found any.

Overall a good buy!",4
"Purchased this monitor for urgent need by seeing majority of 5-star ratings. Received this item today and unboxed it to find it as a substandard product. Not value for money. Repenting now for my buy since Amazon said I cannot exchange it unless it has some defect in it.

This is pretty old product it seems (2017). There is another new GL series (July-2020) LED monitor from BenQ available at same price(10K), description shows as LED monitor, when I was searching it was in the list recommended by Amazon, bad...

-The picture quality is not good.
-Sound quality is also poor.
-On the box it's mentioned as LED, but backside of monitor it's mentioned as LCD.
-Almost 6 inches of desk width it occupies on the computer table due to it's poor design of stand. This leads to strain on eyes.

Another observation: This 24 inch monitor causing a toll on eyes so don't buy 24-inch for WFH with 2-ft wide computer desk. better go for 22-inch.",2
"I use it for engineering design stuff as second monitor. It serves the purpose for me. It has blue filter already on so u will get yellowish tint image as u get on phone.
There is one small plastic part under monitor seems like remote sensor. But no remote and no mention of anything anywhere.
Cable management and vesa mounth is good. Build quality i like for this price range.
I felt happy for wht i paid.
Seem less design.",5
"I found it completely useless for my daily office work.

I had hardly used it for 8 day's, because my eyes started paining after using this monitor.
Eyes become full of tear and lot of pain.",1
"I bought this Monitor after spending days reviewing and comparing however the product did not meet the expectations at all.
The major problem is the Text Distortion , I doubt the quality of HDMI cable provided with this piece is poor quality

Text are blurry and i cant even reach out to their customer support team.
Is there anything possible to get the text distortion issue sorted ? Any expert view will be highly appreciated.",2
Don't buy this. It comes with a 15A plug. Practically unusable in bed room and study room or office room. You can use it in utility and kitchen by removing washing machine or microwave. They give you one old VGA cable again useless for new laptop. None of these things are mentioned in product description.,1
"In the first month monitor flickered a little but then was fine. And now, within 3 months, there is a broad white line around it with very high flickering. Called cust care for technician to come, he keeps calling everyday but hasn't visited from last 2 days. Ridiculous",5
"Writting this review after 2months of usage. 22"" model
Really appreciate the quality and features of this monitor.
I am 100% with this purchase.
I fell in love with this bezzel less screen in this price segment.
I think 22"" inch model is sufficient for general and office usage.
I am totally impressed with eye care system.
Sound is also acceptable, we can manage with this sound.
Look's soo stylish and Colour quality is awesome.
We have many features where we can adjust screen according to our work.
A must buy product.

Cons:
Should have send HDMI cable
Atleast one USB port should be there to connect Bluetooth.

But overall, I seriously suggest you guy's to go ahead with this purchase with out having any doubts.",5
"I purchased this monitor then i know its pixe density is only 92
While Lg monitor 22"" pixel density is 102

That's why this 24 inch monitor is cheap
Although there used lg panel with low pixel density.
If i know it further then i will go for LG 22"" monitor .",3
"Value for money at 9750 INR, 24"" IPS, inbuilt speaker, automated brightness control, great & intuitive cable management, dual HDMI port along with regular D port. audio / headset output, automated sleep function, automatic faster input selection, multi-color power indicator nicely placed at the bottom of the bezel. Simple, no fuss, ease of use design. Overall value for money, excellent monitor at this price.",5
"I bought this primarily for programming.
Didnt find any backlight bleeding issues as mentioned in some of the other reviews.
Yes, the brightness could be a bit on the lower side when the room is dark and auto brightness is turned ON but its not that big of a deal. The blacks could be calibrated a bit more darker.

Overall its a decent value for money.",4
"Product packing was really good and it includes HDMI cable as well.
If you're looking for a cheaper option for just programming, netflix and stuff connected to your laptop, then definitely a good buy. But if you have to do anything like remote connection, light designing work or light gaming etc.. then probably you might want to spend a little more..

Now manufacturer/product issues and which costed the rest of the three stars:
- It's not an edge-to-edge display (check my first image & it's quite easily visible)
- Ghosting issue (especially while on remote connection)
- Games like Asphalt 9 cannot be played easily (fps issue)",3
"Perhaps the best thing that I bought this diwali.
My eyes are loving it.
The monitor's in-built sensor automatically controls the brightness according to ambient light and keeps your eyes happy.
The in-built speakers are OK, I use external speakers anyway.
The picture quality is right there at the very top.
This monitor is a big value of money.....actually it's a bargain at this price.",5
"The screen started having problem of multiple lines flickering on the screen post 7 months of purchase.
The use of screen being only for office purpose yet started having such issues.
Not a quality build product",1
"Just received this monitor 2 days back. Assembling the monitor is very easy. Only 2 parts. I experience no fatigue while working unlike my laptop. Overall Good for working and studying. Height adjusting is also good.
But on the downside, it occupies space behind the screen, so make sure your study table has enough width.
I tested in dark room and bright lit room, there is only limited change in brightness when in dark room. I have expected iPhone like sensitivity. (May be I am wrong as I need to explore some more features)
Packing received from Amazon is teared when I had received it. But there is no damage to monitor box. I hope this monitor will last for a longer duration.",4
"The video quality is very good. The design of the product is also good with thin borders. However, the audio quality of inbuilt speakers is extremely poor. I have an earlier model of the same product GW2270. That GW2270 has superior audio quality compared to this later model.

Another small issue is that no HDMI cable is provided (mentioned in the desc). However, the VGA cable that is provided is too small, barely 1m long.",3
"This is excellent. I selected it because of elevation / height adjusting feature.

No doubt quality is best in itself. Got the delivery, next day after the order placed.

Well packed and safe. I would like to say 24"" inch is the best for monitor & PS4 playing purpose.

27"" wont be balanced one while you have very less distance between you and screen during monitor work with laptop/desktop/playstation.

24"""" inch is the recommended size.

Obviously Benq is Quality ! Speaker is also inbuilt, may not be needed everytime, still a source of sound with screen.",5
the picture quality is good for normal working. even for playing high-resolution videos. haven't played video games so cannot say anything about that. but overall the video quality is good. the speaker's voice is a bit low compared to the laptop speakers.,5
Would have given a negative if there was one. This monitor slows down my iMac and occasionally hangs too. Couldnt work from citrix either. I could not return the item as the only option provided is replace with the exact item. Called Amazon customer service and received an appalling service. Called the seller directly and couldn't get through to them despite several attempts. Atrocious.,1
"-Good connectivity options
-Great looks n build in price
-Nice thin bezel
-Great for general extended use (work, surfing etc.)
-Easy to assemble
-Not height adjustable with default stand, should be fine, you can buy other custom stands as required
-Not for hard core gamers at given resolution n frame rate, but that is expected at this price point. Should be very sufficient of you are casual gamer and on budget
-Various display modes n settings available, handy for switching between work mode n multimedia
-Inbuilt speakers are just bad, don't consider them to be there n just ignore.

Overall a great choice around 8500.
Was thinking of going for 27 inch of same model but would have pixelated the content since my primary use was to make it extension on work laptop for close viewing and sometimes with Firestick n Raspberry Pi.",5
"Good for eyes- love the eye care feature. I used BenQ external CD Writer in 2002 worked excellent. Taiwanese company known for its quality.

Thought the monitor was made in Taiwan, seems they made it in China.

No HDMI cable included- found it awkward, with hdmi expected a hdmi cable. Only vga cable included.

Fortunately I have ordered mini display port to hdmi for my Mac book air. So could connect it immediately!!",5
"Pretty good for office works. Enough brightness as needed and less strain to eyes for sure. Not tested much for gaming or watching videos. Will update my review once it's tested.

What I feel can be improved:

1) The innovative screw at the bottom to fix the stand. It doesn't fit properly at one go, but had to try multiple times to fit in.
2) The on-screen OSD menu of the monitor looks oldish. Hoping we can get get an firmware update to the monitor that has a new redesigned OSD menu.",4
"Writing review after 3 days of use:
This is a nice monitor in this price range.

Review after 15 days:
Reducing the stars for faulty item and replacement guy behavior and handling of the new/replacement item.
Monitor had a flicker issue and white border after use of 5 days.

Best Part:
Thanks a lot to Amazon team (5 star) for handling this case gracefully and refunding the money.
First time delivery and return pickup guys were co operative and did assisted well and shown compassion to the customer. Top of all Customer care executive took the note of what went well and what could have been improved.

Worst Part:
The delivery guy who came for replacement of the item was rude and his boss asked questions over phone what is the fault and all which was not expected. The delivery guys who came for replacement was rude and did not handled old and new package carefully and Rejected the replacement by saying the serial number is not present.

However, later I figured it out that It was there on the BenQ box.",3
"I had double thoughts before purchasing this one as the reviews were mixed but i still went through it and glad that i didn't regret it.!

Man it's a beautiful stunning screen which I got for around 9450/-

It has a matte finish and has an adjustable tilt not much it is adjustable as per convenience. The assembly was easy and the stand is good and sturdy, also it is compatible for wall mount.

The colors are really very satisfactory and the brightness is adaptive. The panel is Anti glare and i work with a tube light behind me and have not faced any glare issues the display works like a charm.

The main reason I took this was for it's multiple connectivity as it has 1 HDMI 1 DP port 1 Vga 1 Audio Out 1 Head phone in.
I usually connect my Ps4 via HDMI and PC through the DP port and so the VGA is unused for me. There is also a panel behind for the organizing the wire efficiently.

There are inbuilt speakers 2W each which felt a bit disappointing as they are not that loud or not that much useful but the audio out port covers this issue.

It has some eye care protection function and can be turned on or controlled through the monitor itself.

I've had read many reviews on backlight bleeding and IPS panel issues it's been almost a month I'm using this monitor for about 12 to 14 hours but I've not faced anything like that yet. Also people tend to get confused with a IPS glow to backlight bleeding.

However I'm very happy with this monitor as it's a 24 inch one having multiple connectivity options and the display is delightful altogether this is far superior than the other in this price range.!!!!!!!",5
"Sleek and beautiful looking monitor, wish it had worked. It powered up with a pale backlit screen. OSD button controls don't do anything. Picture doesn't show when I connected HDMI. Only the sound was playing.

I waited for 8 days to get this monitor, the waiting begins again for the replacement. Hopefully the replacement works well. Fingers crossed.",1
"The quality of panel is way better than i thought and the colour production id very even and good. the only thing was the refresh rate is low which is not recommended for gamers. But for general usage, office work and movie watching it was a good choice. please see other reviews before purchase",4
"Received one BENQ 21.5 inches LED BACKLIT computer monitor Model GW2283 through AMAZON yesterday on 3rd July 2021. On connecting the Monitor to my iMac through the HDMI port of the Monitor and Type C thunderbolt and Hdmi connector on my Mac side it says "" No Signal detected ""
I changed the Hdmi port on the monitor from 1 to 2 with proper selection on the monitor and still it says "" No signal detected""
When I use the same set up to connect to my Samsung TV , the display of the iMac works fine.
When I login to my Amazon account and want to return the monitor It says only replacement after 7 days. I am in urgent need of the monitor . I don't know how to solve the issue",1
"This is the best monitor for me. Has blue light filtering modes, custom keys for setting brightness, etc.

Although the auto brightness works in different way than I expected, it does it's job. I don't really use though. I imagined it to be something like phone's auto-brightness. It only changes contrast, and a little bit of brightness.

Apart from that the viewing experience is best. Can tilt the monitor easily. The stand is very handy.",5
"I bought this display for my work from home setup, and though I was skeptical initially about it's resolutions vs it's 27 inches size, I was satisfied with the image quality and overall performance. The display gets fairly bright and is great for work and movie/video watching.

Works way better than LCD's, has no white backlight. Speakers are a bit dull, they have decent sound quality but they are very quiet. My laptop speakers produce louder and better sound than speakers on this display. But I expected the sound to be not that great, and I have external speakers/headphones to use instead of default display speakers.

The stand height is not adjustable, but you can tilt the angle of screen forwards and backwards.

Overall a great screen, I've been using this for a year now.",5
"ill split my review into two parts gaming and casual use

gaming
this is definitely a capable monitor for gaming. gorgeous colors, deep contrasts and overall just looks amazing. AAA titles are just an amazing experience especially if your main display is your laptop screen. just two different worlds.
that said this monitor is noticeably held back by its refresh rate. my laptop screen clicks by at 120hz, nearly twice that of this and although it does not make a huge difference in single player games it really is quite noticeable in games like pubg and cs go. definitely would not recommend if your primary purpose is gaming (especially competitive gaming)

casual use
Much of my collage work has shifted over to online work since the pandemic so i find myself spending a ridiculous amount of time in front of a screen. the bigger screen definitely helps productivity i find. usually have a split screen setup going with this. the viewing angles are also pretty awesome. no color distortion as far as i can tell. definitely not compared to the laptop monitor i use.
now the on to the main reason i got this monitor,
i thought about it and i found that i was spending about 2-4 hours a day on a computer per day and that rises significantly on a weekend. on average about 25-30 hrs a week most of this is web browsing watching videos (youtube, movies, etc) and small part would be gaming.

In short if you want the best gaming monitor i suggest looking elsewhere. if you want one of everything else this is a great buy for the price.
ps ive been told its pretty good for Photoshop too( i dont use it myself so i cant verify.)",3
"Pros:
looks good enough
IPS vieweing angles are just fine
Sound is just okay

Cons:
This product has issues with color reproduction
Every time laptop goes into power down mode or we have a reboot, this monitor needs to be explicitly detected using windows drivers to detect. This doesn't happen with any of the three other monitors I have",3
"# The picture quality and color reproduction is good. I tried playing 4k UHD video (btw, this is a full HD monitor)
# The brightness options offered are good.
# Buttons for control are convenient.
# The cable hiding is nice.
# HDMI cable is supplied in box.
# The assembly is easy.
# The base is Matt finish and anti skid.
# Speakers are good and loud enough when used at 100%
# Some tilt adjustment is there.
# screen is non-glossy.
(I am not a gamer :-D )

* Only lacking feature is vertical height adjustment.",5
"I'm writing this review after 4 months of usage.

Materials:
The build quality is superb, and I personally loved the ergonomics of this monitor.
This monitor can be rotated vertically for programming and also can be swiveled from the sides.
It can also be pivoted/tilted behind to align to your line of sight.
The stand helps you to also raise the monitor which can be a blessing in case you're a tall person.
The bezels are thin and I love them. They give a more sleek look.
I would definitely give a full 5 stars for the ergonomics of this monitor.

Picture quality:
Maximum resolution supported is 1920 x 1080.
This can output a FHD displaying via a good VGA cable, HDMI port and DVI port.
The picture quality is crisp and really good for programming, reading & multimedia.
The AI brightness technology is pretty good and automatically adjusts the screen brightness based on the room illumination.
Monitor has a lot of features in the menu, which I find pretty crazy/good.
If you are not a professional gamer, you wouldn't really notice the difference in the refresh rates.

Warranty & support:
Benq support team is really good and actually respond to your requests swiftly. I had some issue with the monitor for which I contacted the Benq team and got it resolved within a matter of days. FYI, this monitor has a 3 years warranty and I would definitely recommend this product.",5
"Brightness is too high sometimes even at 10% setting. Automatic brightness adjustment not working with custom mode, standard mode is too bright for room light condition.

Viewing angle is good, picture is crisp and clear, headphone output is too low even at 100% in monitor setting.

What i hate in this monitor?
Too heavy, yes looks like 4-5kg.... 2nd made in China.

What I like?
Auto input selection. You can put 2 hdmi and 1 vga device. If you start any device, monitor will display that device automatically.

2nd speaker is good for hearing computer sound but not for watching movies.",2
"Do not buy this product, I had done a mistake I purchased it over Dell for saving 2k now end up with dead pixel in the screen with in a month.
There warranty already mentioned up to 2dead pixel are allowed. What a strange idea.
Never going for cheap.",1
"i have used for about a month and finding no issues. i mainly bought for doing work (since my 14'' laptop monitor doesn't give enough space to open files properly), for web browsing, watching online streams. i find the view quality quite good for all these usage. don't feel glare even after working for long duration, but had to change the default brightness/contrast setting for that which is quite easy.",5
"I purchased the product after going through hundreds of reviews and comments on the monitors of 21-22 inches screen size, not only in Amazon, but also in other e Commerce sites. I found this product as the best in this range which have the required quality without making big holes in my pocket.",5
"I am more than happy with the product and its delivery. Have been using it for 1 day now and I am more than happy and I just wish and pray that this continues.

Pros:
1. Value for money
2. Amazing clarity
3. Superb and sleek design

Cons:
1. No USB Port (Can live with it though, if you get a USB hub :))
2. Audio output is pathetic (Please ignore it and get an external speaker)",4
"I clicked the picture at night as I'm too lazy to turn on the lights.
Overall this monitor is very good. fell into my budget. comes with 2 hdmi and inbuilt speakers. also has port for 3.5mm jack. 5 physical keys below the screen to control settings and power on/off.
I'm using both the hdmi ports as one is used for Amazon fire stick while another is used for laptop connection.
Stand and size is good. even the build quality is very sturdy one. haven't faced any issues yet.",5
"Really glad I made this purchase. Until the Prime Sale a couple of weeks back, I was using only my laptop for work at my table. Wasn't able to get the right balance of screen height and keyboard height.
I tried putting my laptop on a small portable laptop desk and put my keyboard under, which was solved the height issues... but ended up with a very cluttered setup.

So, put this monitor, a desk mount and a desk mat in my wishlist and waited for the Prime Day sale. Really happy with the setup.

Coming to the monitor, the size is perfect for me. The various blue light filter modes are good. I primarily use the 'Office' mode, and change to 'Media' mode while watching movies.
The four navigation buttons on the bottom right corner are very convenient and the configurable settings offered are more than enough for basic office work and some simple editing.

Was a little skeptical going for this as the price was much lower compared to the other 24"" monitors available. But, I'm really glad I went for this.",5
"I am just blow away by its quality, contrast and anti-glare prowess.
For the price , its the best monitor to start your video/ photo/entertainment journey.
Colours are really good and accurate, its and ips screen.
Do note the monitor isn't build for gaming, it can play games with good colors but will have some screen-tearing .

The only minor cons i have is :
Doesn't include hdmi cable from the box.
Brightness isn't sufficient if you are going to use it on well lit rooms or near windows.",5
"I bought this product as I am working from home during the Covid situation and needed an affordable monitor where I could project my laptop screen.
Pros:
No bleed
Decent configuration considering the competitive price
Compact Size
VESA Wall Mount
No flickering

Scope of Improvement:
In built speakers are of no use. They could have removed them from monitor.
Monitor goes in sleep mode after a couple of minutes while working on MAC. This is not seen in Microsoft Windows.",5
"It is better than other cheap va/ips panel of similar size and price. I have another one from acer(27inch 75hz).

Picture quality of this panel is good and you get 70% srgb color gamete.

I am using same Benq monitor for dual monitor setup. Incase you plan to go for dual monitor like me. You need to manually calibrate the color since it would be lil difference out of the box.",4
"""No cons as of now after using it exactly 2 months"".
1. Really worth using it.
2. Like others I am working from home for last few months and thought of buying a bigger screen, after search found this product suitable for me and purchased it.
3. Within a second the screen visibility get adjusted to the surrounding light and your eyes hardly notice it, really Excellent.
4. To be honest, this should have been at least Rs 1500 - 2000/- cheaper than the selling price. I purchased it for 9750/-.",5
"I have been using it for more than 3 months and i can say its overall excellent monitor if you are using it for your work and software development related task ! Colour grade are vibrant and smooth which doesn't result in eye pain if you sit in front of it for more than 5-6 hours in a day !
Not suitable for gamers they would require higher refresher rate which it doesn't has but if your main purpose is not gaming just buy it wont be disappointed at all !",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 It is too good. I was little hesitant about the company initially but thank God it's too good. Delivery was excellent and so is the product. Only drawback is that the inbuilt speaker are not powerful so anyways you have to use the speakers or earphones. Otherwise it's really good. I am happy with my purchase.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 This is really good monitor (I purchased it for INR-8,499/- during amazon's offer sale).
The monitor is very good for the designers and developers. The color rendering and Brightness of the monitor is really good.
The price of the monitor is less, comparing with the other brands.

The inbuilt speakers are not good quality one. It is just normal speakers.
Comparing with Samsung and LG monitors, the brightness level is less.",4
"This is a brilliant Monitor if you are looking to get one for Office use/ and a bit of leisure use. It's got a great eye care system for long-term use. I have used this monitor in two sizes over the last two years. I would highly recommend this one. I use it daily for on avg 10-11 Hours, I have it connected to both my office laptop and personal one and can switch over at will, and it's very very convenient.",5
"Looked around for budget range of 24"" IPS FHD monitors and had these options - LG 24MPxxxx, Benq GW2480, Dell P2419H, SE2418H and an Acer variant. The Dell monitor seemed perfect fit when it came to features - height adjustment, USB 3.0 hub connectivity, rotation in addition to what I find in this Benq model. However, I found this display at a festival discount offer and the price difference made me purchase this model (INR 7.5k vs INR 12.5k).

1. Delivery experience : First time I had an experience of receiving a damaged product for an Amazon Order. But the resolution was smooth. I ordered a replacement online immediately after unpacking and the replacement was delivered within 2 days. Quite impressed with the service.

2. Display quality : Most people have already commented on display quality. The build quality seems decent, IPS display is beautiful at a viewing distance of 2-2.5ft, I enabled blue light filter at all times and it doesn't strain the eyes at all, cable management facility is neat - my desk is uncluttered and I find the Windows scaling setting at 100% ideal for my daily use. I do not game and neither am I into professional multimedia editing and I do not believe anyone who does one or both of these should even be considering this display. There are alternatives for those use cases.

3. Speaker : haven't used it and never used it with earlier monitors either. I hope people don't consider this an essential feature for monitors. It shouldn't be.

Overall a nice, economical upgrade to my 20"" 720p LCD monitor. I hope the product is as durable as my earlier monitors.",4
"First I got a defective product. But amazon made my replacement easy and smooth thanks to amazon team.

The product is awesome screen are sharpe and clear color are vibrant this monitor as some modes to like others srgb, reading, movie etc.. Its worth for you money

Cons is screen bleeding like other already send in review but you won't notice in normal use overall its a good monitor",5
"Seller is appairo. Received totally used piece. Everything was opened and dusty. There was only power cord available in the box. Buy the monitor offline from trusted stores. Never make a mistake purchasing it online.

Monitor quality is good. You should buy it. But only offline. Never trust amazon sellers.",1
"The unit i received has a constant vertical line towards right of the screen, and it was there as soon as i switched it on the first time, without any external connections on the benq welcome page. With external connections the same result.

Thanks to amazon for hassle free return process, have initiated the same. Hope all goes well.",1
"I have bough this monitor for home office purpose

Delivery and Packing : very good packing, and its delivered one day prior to the committed date

Iam writing this on Seconda day of use, I feel very comfortable than my previous Acer monitor. Adaptive Brightness is working well, and eyes feel relaxed, Watching movie is also I feel good, Iam not a gamer and so Iam a wrong person to comment on it. Overll I feel good

Cons : There is no height adjustable feature.

Thank you",5
"I bought this monitor to use for office purpose. My main work is on emails and Excel sheets and using a Lenovo T-480.

I have used it for 4-5 hours and no issues as of now. Would write a long term review after using it for couple of months and if I remember :)",5
"I received the box with a wrong power cable, a 16A one which will fit only in AC outlet. I talked to Amazon & BenQ mutiple times , niether was helpful nor was ready for any replacement cable. I surprised to hear the BenQ support guy said ""it is like that"". I ended up buying an after market power cable.
It is an okay product with decent picture quality as a regular monitor, not for games, as I can see gray lines when playing high speed video.",2
"I needed to get an external monitor because my laptop screen seemed a bit small for me. This monitor is pretty big and the price wasn't bad at all. It has multiple modes you can use (multimedia mode, reading mode, office mode, etc). Each mode can be used for a different type of purpose.

I dont like my screen to be too bright so I use the reading mode, which adds some yellow to the screen. It's very soft on my eyes.

For gaming, it's amazing! The colors are really vibrant and there's no pixelisation. I would definitely recommend this.",5

 Review after using this monitor for about 7 months

Pros :

Excellent picture quality for the price.
Nice viewing angle ( no colour shifta ).
Looks stylish with very narrow bezel.
No stand hight issue like other monitors for multi monitor setup.
Anti galre really helps in bright environment.
Not bad for gaming though its a 60 hz panel.

Cons :
Crapy speaker.
Light sensor not very well-calibrated.

Overall a very good product for work or casual gaming.
Highly recommended.",5
"It is a LED backlit 1080p 60Hz monitor. Picture quality is great. You can use this for multi purpose. The text is crisp even at low viewing distance. Viewing angle is also very good. Overall the monitor feels premium with its small bezels. It has also a cable management system behind it. Also the packaging was good. Great value for money.
Couple of things to note:
1) You don‚Äôt get an HDMI cable with it. Only VGA is included in the box.
2) The power cord provided has bigger power plugs which was not compatible with normal power plugs. I had to use a smaller one I had.",5
"This is best for this price segment. It has a brightness sensor. It auto adjust the brightness. The inbuilt speaker is not so good. It has a 3 types of connectivity option. VGA, Display Port, HDMI. And it has also audio output option with 3.5mm jack. Picture quality is also very nice. And the attractive part is it has a very slim bezel which gives a very classic and sexy looks.",5
"We dont have option to return, if it is not matching our requirement. For this monitor size, Full HD resolution is not enough. Buy 24 inch monitor if you are buying for test related work/purpose",3
"This monitor is really good at this price point ( I got it for 7,750 during amazon sale )
Pros:
1.Colors are much more Vibrant then normal LED's, i have a triple monitor Setup so i can compare this with other LED's
from dell.
2.Dark and Bright values are much better differentiated.
3.The best one is the price you cant get any thing better than this at this price Point...Kudos to Benq for that
4. Brightness is way too much high

Cons
1. There is some back light bleeding ( But that is ok even expensive monitors has minor light bleeds)

At this price point i think Benq has done a great job.
if you want a cheap IPS display then this monitor is for you.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Very nice product which I receive today from Amazon. Thanks to Amazon and service center Person name Mr.Reddy who solve my Problem. He manage me it for quick delivery. Thanks to him more from my side. I am very glad to him and sending me a very nice porduct to my native. Thanks to all service Persons of Amazon again.",5
"The ambient light sensor is better than others it will adjust brightness very quickly. Added with blue light filter technology, this monitor will not strain your eyes on long working hours.

Other things like color quality, and image crispness are also very good. Good response for gaming. Best features at a low price.",5
"27‚Äù monitor came with 15A plug. Upon reaching out to BenQ support on email, they delivered 5A plug free of cost within 2 business days.

One of the best suited for long working hours as it has adaptive brightness which is very convenient and easy on eyes with blue ray filter.

2nd addition in the gap of 6months. 1st one was 24‚Äù for my wife(techie).

@BenQ...27‚Äù Monitor could have had 2HDMI ports.",5
"This piece is just amazing. I ordered an LG a couple days ago but Amazon delivered a defective on that I had to return. Based on the reviews I went ahead and ordered this one. The size is 24"" which is larger than the LG one I bought. Picture quality, brightness, color depth, sharpness and even the sound output from the built-in speakers is great. It's just been one day that I am using this but I really liked the product. It's the best in that price range where most LG / Dell / HP ones are usually defective on Amazon.",5
"It's a perfect example of value for money üí∏.
It has IPS LCD display, it has automatic brightness sensor, it can be tilted without much effort, the cable management is fantastic, the reduced edge display is fantastic, the colour and everything else is fantastic.

Go for it! For <‚Çπ9k it's a perfect bang!",5
"Monitor is good for office and home use. Has good viewing angles, the sensor for autobrightness works fine. This monitor is good for coding and general use like surfing or browsing internet, working on documents. The inbuild sound speakers that comes with monitor are not suitable for music or movies and can serve the purpose of notifications sounds or silent music with not bass. Monitor stand is stif and good. Overall a good monitor after a use of one month. Not good for professional gamers.",4
"My first monitor, although i have been planning to buy same for almost a year. By far, this is the best in the market monitors that I have been using for almost a month and I can't complain. Full worth of 17K for 27''. I am using it mostly for software development, watching movies online and gaming. Although picture quality is not upto the mark since it supports only 1080p.

If you are on budget and looking for a monitor, go with this one. Its definitely worth it",3
"Very Very happy with this monitor. It is of best quality. Some people are reporting ghosting but I never faced any such kind under default setting and default setting of this monitor perfectly fine with me and have no inclination to change it. Regarding the sound quality of built-in speaker, I admit that volume is low but not that you can't here. Screen are non-glossy and non-reflective which is good for eye. Monitor stand is hard and sturdy which is great. Edge of the bezel is thinner than that of my laptop. Delivery was fast - monitor delivered to me two days before time. Overall, am extremely happy with this BenQ monitor....",5
"I got the monitor for my office work and the display is pretty crisp.. it also loads content extremely fast as soon as connected to laptop via HDMI cable
The inbuilt cable management system is a boon to avoid messing /tangling of cables.
The only downside so far are the built in speakers which are not at all loud even at high volume.",4
"I am not a gamer so the rating given for gaming represents ""I do not know"". As I am using it for software development work it serves my purpose fullest. It has good brightness range to take care of daylight as well as night work situation. I did some photo editing as well and found the colors natural and not adding any tint. Did not do any extensive color tests as I am not going to use it for serious photo/video reproduction. I do coding and this monitor works for me.",5
"It is one of the most affordable Stunning Full HD Display with Wide Viewing Angle IPS Panel,
Edge to Edge Slim Bezel Design and with input connectivity for D-sub, HDMI and DP",5
"The monitor is perfect for work for home. It's heavy (not flimsy) and sturdy. The design is understated just like to my taste. The best feature is adaptive brightness which control the brightness throughout the day and night and do not strain my eyes during long working hours. As I do just office work on the monitor, I am not sure about the picture quality or gaming performance.",5
"An extremely elegant looking and sturdy product. I am greatful that I did not go for LG or Samsung as some reviews suggest.

Picture quality is crisp with the panel being uniform compared to some others I have seen. It has 2 HDMI Ports and Audio In/Out jacks. The built in speaker, given the sleekness of product, is sufficient for meetings or attending classes.

Overall, given it's price, you can go for this product with your eyes closed.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I have used many monitors like Dell LG HP Acer and had a good experience with LG and Acer and never liked HP and Dell.

As I am not a serious gamer I use these monitors for programming and reading (sometimes I play games a bit).

This 27 inch monitor is the best for multitasking as it's a huge screen and you can easily perform 4 task at a time.

This has a good viewing angles. The texts and images appear sharp.

There is only one con that I have seen till now is that it has some I mean very less light bleeding. So yeah even 30k-40k have that.

You can hear to the song that I played for you. This monitor has nice inbuilt speakers which are pointed downwards. No complaints can be made according to the price of the monitor.

I think it's the best monitor monitor you can get at this price range.

You can check other monitors with similar features will be around 16-20k. I got this for exact 13993.

Kudos to BenQ and Amazon for that‚ù§‚ù§",5
"Hi, This is my first order in Amazon. I am little skeptical in ordering online . However i had to take a chance because of this pandemic . Overall it was smooth experience. I am pleased to give a review comments on this BenQ 24'' Monitor. Overall happy , except few things that failed in below mentioned. Hope this helps to all. Thanks
Pros :
1. Delivered day before than expected date without any damages left which is awesome .
2. Features are same as they described
3. It is sleek , good looking
4. Easy to fix the stand without much efforts. It is sturdy too.
5. Viewing 178 degree angle is working good .
6. Easy to plugin to your laptop using HDMI cable that provided with this monitor
7. Fun watching movies / videos and office work on this monitor as it is enough size for both purposes.
Cons:
1. I wish they could deliver with extra wrap for preventing any damages/loss.
2. I feel it is emerging extra brightness even though i could adjust all settings. Because of the high brightness , i feel starting headache :(
3. I don't see Adoptive Brightness feature is working fine .
4. I feel the cost is little high because of the Adoptive brightness failure .
5. And Volume is not that great . They could offer good volume with this monitor as it is more expensive.",4
"I purchased this Monitor for programming/photo editing , and it is pretty good for my purpose. The extraordinary thing about this is seamless height adjustment and tilt.

Colours are accurate.

This monitor is a very good all purpose entry level monitor which should suffice 90% of users.

Like a i20/swift in cars..

Please note that it has 5ms response time and it is a LCD monitor.

More than happy with the purchase.",5
"The first product i received had missing parts.
I complained about this and got the whole package replaced.
I am very much satisfied with my purchase.
The bezel less display is amazing.
The brightness modes for media, websurfing, reading make the perfect t
Transition from my office work to Netflix!
The speakers are not very effective..so you will require external speakers for movies.
However i am very much satisfied with the overall product.
The text is crisp and no lag between the keyboard inputs.",5
"Ideal for Work-from-home environment. Anti-glare works wonders for extended sessions. Of-course, it is always recommended to take a break for a minute after 30 minutes of staring at the monitor.

Gaming experience has been pleasant. The stock 60Hz can be overclocked to 74Hz-75Hz if desired but to someone that plays single player games exclusively , high refresh rates are a waste of money IMO.

Very wide viewing angles. Colour accuracy is okay but good enough for most tasks for the average user. My work doesn't involve any video/photo-edition so there are zero complaints. Extremely demanding users need to consider other options and also shell out more money.

Monitor prop stand is durable and sturdy with very little wobble.

TL;DR Value for money product.",5
The Screen was delivered to me in 3 days that's the only good part. The outer packaging was damaged and infact the product inside was also having dead spots in the screen. Not at all worth buying.,1
"As per me, i like thin design, but if ur buying go for 24"" for if 1080, if u need 27"" get 1920 or 4k, dont get 27"" 1080... But budget wise if u need 27"" n if u sit far for watching movie and all its fine...",4
"Good deal. One of the best deals you would get when looking for cheaper office monitors. I bought it for 8000. I like it very much till now (almost a month of usage). Picture quality is good and comes with many diaplay modes and blue light filter. Sensor to detect brightness (for auto detect) is a good value add.

Being said that, there are some flaws. Most disappointing thing for me is that my monitor flickers once in a while. Very occasional, but it happens. Happened 3 times till now. Secondly, the earphones socket is very very difficult to reach out to. If you are not removing it often, then no issues. But otherwise, it's a definite problem. For a guy like me who uses one earphone for phone and laptop, it's annoying.

Nonetheless, cheaper and decent quality.",4
"Good to go,but they should place the menu control in front side instead bottom of the panel,
by the way the size itself is enough to handle vscode with all widows opened [Ref 1st Image],
unfit for wating a movie,its getting pixelarated due to low res.
Best for surfing and programming etc..",5
"Picture quality is excellent for the price range. I think this is the only brand to offer the best quality in this price range. The finishing of the frame, simple cable management is good. An HDMI cable is provided unlike most brands.

I already had a benq for one of my systems and then saw the Samsung curved model. Made the mistake of buying that for my second system. I have now returned the Samsung and purchased my second benq with a screen size upgrade.",5
"This is an excellent Monitor. I use it for my Laptop extensions.
It can be wall mounted easily.
Speakers are very poor I even cant listen any audio at a distance of 1 or 2 ft.
But this issue is not a deal breaker.
Please go for this monitor.",5
The monitor started to blink frequently. It goes off and after a few seconds comes back. The power connection has no issues. It is just the blinking which is irritating. I was very happy with the product until now and thought of adding one more same monitor to my display. But from when this strated it is a serious work hindrance and I will wait to see their service quality.,3
"Good picture quality, full HD
It has inbuilt speakers, no other monitor offers this at this price. No HDMI cable provided. It's the best full HD monitor at lowest price in market.
We can use this as TV, i am able to connect Amazon fire stick to it. Works perfectly well. So just buy it.
This is not made in india.",5
"Short review.
Pros:
Good display quality.
Overclockable to 75 hz easily by nvidia control panel.
Looks beautiful with thin bezels( best looking in segment)
Taiwanese brand.
Cons:
Useless vga cable in box.
Navigation buttons on montior are not easy to use.
Unnecessary 15 ampere plug, majority will be needing an 5 amp to 15 amp converter . That's additional headache.
That's all for now .
21.5 inch is best size for 1080p. Screen resolution in 21.5 inch is like amoloed feeling.",4
"Why you go for an imac display; spending lot of money...go for this. But be aware about ports including the display port graphic card port..other external ports. This one have several ports..
I have an I mac as well..
This one i ve bought luckily and suits all my requirements. Two HDMI is always preferable for double display options. I guarantee this one and is fine for several purposes.",5
"A superb monitor at a decent price. I wasn't expecting the paradigm shift to be that big when moving from a 19 inch to 24 inch monitor for my gaming and video playback. Couple it with a 4k compatible graphic card display, this monitor is just sweetness overloaded. I recommend to anyone looking for a decent 24 inch monster that comes at a good price",5
"Bought this monitor after seeing the reviews
Its good for watching motives and web browsing

not good for content creators the colors are not true black values are off looks dull
i work in Photoshop, aftereffects and other creative software's this monitor won't be a good option for us as we need to see the true srgb and black values
i edited a images for a client with this monitor then when i saw it in my laptop it looked so different the brightness/ contrast were totally all over the place i had to redo the whole thing.
so i returned it back to amazon

hope it'll help fellow graphic designers and content creators to make a decision",3
Value for money monitor. Supports vesa mounting for all mounting. Monitor is 5 cm thick so quite minimal footprint. The stand which comes with monitor is also quite good with wire management and is also very sleek. A laptop can also rest on top of the stand bottom in an inclined manner without any problems providing for a clutter free desk.,5
"The package contained 15A power 3-pin power cable. As you know, no one has a 15A power socket near their computer station. I had to contact the BenQ support and request them to send normal 10A power cable. Monitor was delivered on 5th May and the correct power cable was delivered on 18th May. I could not use the monitor till then. I do not understand how such a basic packaging mistake (and quality check) could be done by a reputed company such as BenQ.",3
"What a great product!!
I am very pleased with it. Matt finish. Doesn't reflect nearby objects/images on screen.
Good sober colours.
I had 22"" Dell earlier, which was very good too. This seems so much bigger & comfortable to eyes. Less strain.
Good quality make. Well packed.",5
"I got this after I had purchased a cheap ADCOM monitor for my Raspberry Pi. After using the cheap monitor this was a big relief for the eyes. The pic quality is very good. I like the two HDMI ports so I can connect my Laptop as well. Sound quality is terrible, you must connect external speakers.",4
This monitor produces excellent colors with good brightness and contrast. The eye protection is very good for night-time working. I think they should've removed the speaker from the monitor completely to reduce the cost because the speaker volume is too low. Even my headphones produce a louder sounds.,4
This is good monitor overall but the sound is too low. You must rely on your either PC/laptop or external audio that too connected to your computer/laptop. Expect to get low audio when compared to connect jack to your device. and you already know it doesn't have mic. But the speakers are decent enough for hearing inside closed room like bedroom.,3
Great Monitor and timely delivery by Amazon. Included in the box is a 16A Power adapter and VGA to VGA cables which are both useless to most people. Ensure you've a 6A power adapter and HDMI cable in spare before ordering,4
"Pros
1. It has a good viewing angle due to IPS technology.
2. It has its own night mode kind of Eye-care which is good.
3. At this price You won't get this specification in other brands like samsung and LG.

Cons
1. If you want a less bezel monitor. This is not a good choice
2. If you are planning to buy 2 pieces of this product and connect to play games , the bezel will irritate you. And hence not a good choice.
3. Black are not black in this monitor. I have hp elite book and I have a wallpaper of black color . Beleive me they appear far different on both screens ( my laptop and this monitor).
4 . Same as point number 3 , colors are not accurate. So , movie and gaming experience may be a bit low due refresh rate and color accuracy.

Final verdict.
If you searching for a monitor for office work like coding, browsing, MS office kind of work, Go for it . This is an excellent choice.
Don't buy for gaming and video/photo editing.",4
"Best at this price.
Pro: 27"" is big enough for working.
Splitting screen into two is useful.
Even splitting the screen into four is also comfortable at some situations.

Cons: speakers are useless",4
"Response time was slow, neither VGA cable nor CD was present (which was stated in Amazon box components). Behaviour/Speech training is very much essential for Amazon executives...not happy with the conversation but liked their approach unless, it was a waste in time, cost and effort involved in replacing the whole set for a CD (which was also unavailable in the replaced product as stated to them maniar times on call)",4
"Really like to menu and buttons operation, very convenient.
Screen images guide the button placement, no need to look at the buttons.

brightness adjustments based on ambient light are effective.
resolution is only FHD, whereas 2K resolution would be appreciated for this size",4
"Very very nice product.
In build speakers is very nice according to the price.
Screen size colour and bezel is very nice.
Nice feature for the cable manegment.
And is also nicely compatible with wall mount.
Stand is also made up of pure metal and is of good quality.",5
"Loved it. Got it for ~7100/-. I don't think any other 24"" monitor is available at this price with speakers. Speakers are very basic though and could be useful only for notification sounds. But i am okay and happy with overall product.",5
"Very Disappointed, got Damaged Monitor... Up Left corner had dead pixels of approximately 2 sq inch. 2 vertical and 3 horizontal lines of dead pixels... and lot of flickering happening once a while, which i recorded in a video. Dont know if it is a manufacturing fault or transit damage, Replacement requested. I will update about the monitor quality once i got replacement.

Update : Got New Replacement & it was working fine.",4
"It's been month after purchasing this monitor and I am happy with it. Only issue I felt that Display port
not detected when HDMI cable is already connected. For that you have to remove HDMI cable, plug Display port cable and again plug HDMI cable. No issues with VGA. Menu is intuitive. Buttons can be more sturdy. Overall good product in this range.",4
I installed the monitor after a month and I find there is an issue with the power connection. It connect only if I keep the power cable in particular angle. N have to be very careful else power goes of which is really frustrating,2
Monitor is averagely good. They shipped a wrong power cable ( 15A) with the monitor so i had to buy a 5A myself. No easy way to reach support. The form factor looks fine. Overall I may have just gone for a dell. The audio is ok for the price and helps to atleast watch videos without an external monitor.,3
"It's a very good product for ppl who are looking for dual monitor setup.
Picture quality is good.
Pros : 1) Picture Quality
2) Price
3) Decent sound
4) 2 HDMI ports

Cons :
Didn't came across any so far.

Good buy for the price.",5
"For the 27"" Monitor, 1920 x 1080 is not the apt resolution. If you are going with 27"" It is advisable to purchase a 4k Resolution monitor. cos ppi is 81 but it is advisable to have Above 140 ppi for 27"" . which is why the monitor is getting pixelated. Choose wisely before selecting, Because there is no exchange on the product with Seller only Replacement can be made that too if there is any defect or damage. My suggestion is not to buy this product.",1
"Product does not come with HDMI cable and the power plug needs 16amps socket which is commonly used for A/Cs and Geysers and not for other common electric appliances. Needed to replace the existing one with a new 16amps socket after failing to make the Amazon customer service understand the problem and see if any possibility of getting another cable with low amp power plug. One needs to add these additional expenses .

Apart from above it looks to be a good product as of now.",4
"At this price this monitor is worthy. One thing i want to say that it an LCD IPS display, which they kind of manipulating it by saying LED Backlight. Viewing angels are good . Bezels are thin noticeably thin i expected this from it. Picture quality is good , as it is LCD display colours are more accurate. After all most of pro level indestrial used displays also LCD and at 10000 rs its value for money.
This i am writing after few months of use of this monitor and only problem i am facing is excessive backlight bleed . When you use this monitor with a black background sometimes it shows noticable backlight bleed but not every time if you use monitor not for long hours and less frequently then it will not be such a big issue but if you want to buy for extensive long hours of use then this might be a problem for few. Other then that everything works perfect . Ambient light sensor and other functions all are fine.",5
After a lot of review researching and price check I took a decision to buy this Monitor and I have to say that I am very satisfied with my decision of buying it. The anti glare technology works so amazing and that's a plus point while I edit my pictures in a bright lit room with no reflection. The colour quality (RGB) is also perfect and the viewing angles are great what else do you need in a monitor at this price. I haven't tried my hands in gaming but would definitely like to try it. But for now I am totally satisfied with the product.,5
"Build quality is good. Packaged with all kind of accessories like wall mount/cable management etc.

Absolutely no backlight bleeding.

Viewing angle is very good

27"" screen looks really well. With windows 10 full hd resolution, you get lot of extra real estate screen to multitask.

Speakers are okay, don't expect too much

I use it to work from home. In office, I used to have dual monitor setup. This cannot replace that experience but big screen is better for your eyes and for reading as well as for multimedia experience.

Freesync is not supported but works well with basic gaming like ping/cs/COD etc..
I have 4k freesync supported 55"" samsung qled tv for gaming so don't want freesync support in monitor.

Using this with low blue light mode which slightly impacts color calibration but I am fine with it. You can change the mode though as per your need.

It has inbuilt light sensor which works but reacts too fast. I have disabled those as my ambient light does not fluctuate that much.

Matt finish and no glaring.

Power usage is very less

Go for it if not a hard-core gamer. It's best value for money package under 13,500/-.",4
"It's the ultimate purchase for me! Going for 2nd order for dual monitor setup!

Quality 5/5
Screen Bezels looks amazing
Sturdy 5/5
Responsive 5/5
Audio Quality 1/5 ( I don't mind)
Ports 2 HDMI üëåüèª
Vesa Mount üëåüèª

Overall no issues.",5
"My requirements are good screen clarity, height adjust-ability, chrome-cast connectivity and a simple speaker. Benq is quite thoughtful in its design thinking about its customers.
Screen clarity is quite good.

Height adjusting is very easy. you just move the monitor along the arm.
Height adjust-ability is a must if you use a laptop to connect and using both monitors.

One disadvantage I think is having only one HDMI port. They should've added at least two.

Overall I will recommend this.",4
"It's good monitor with tweeks, i like the auto brightness feature but its range is not perfect, it doesn't get very low beyond a point, for picture quality you need to adjust the color manually as it's too bright by default, which is good for photo editing and watching movies, but for office work you need to use intel graphics utility to lower the color and brightness for reduced eye strain, for night mode i use windows 10 inbuilt feature, anti-glare screen looks good, speakers as decent(for watching few videos, don't expect best quality/loudness).

I am a programmer so i keep auto brightness ON, with 5 sharpness, 30 light sensitivity and rest i adjust in the intel graphics utility software.",5
"Truly IPS LED, thought try over DELL monitors and result is amazing.
So clear quality and display,
Automati Brightness,much more screen function and easy to operate.
Its logo at start up is just perfect.
Good one is its standing system with wiring arrangement.
So so so flawless performance, look at its bezzels, slim and beautiful ü•∞.",5
"I have been using this for almost a month now.Great design and build.Nice viewing angles and eye care tech works perfect.There is a reading mode which turns the blue light off and have a yellowish accent, very practical for Work from home uses.I got it for ~7000 with card offers.Overall a nice purchase.",5
"I have bought this product 5 months ago, display is good, eyecare feature good to keep eyes strain free. Audio output is useless my mobile is louder than this. But now there is no sound coming from the monitor's inbuilt speakers and also from the headphone out jack is not working... Now in this covid pandemic cant go out to get this repaired. Wasn't expecting this within just 5 months of usage. Wasted money on this better go with Samsung or Lg",1
"I was thinking to buy LG ultra wide 25 and finally decided to get Benq 27 since screen size is almost similar and screen width will be more on comparison. However since I‚Äôm not an hardcore gamer.It‚Äôs serves my purpose - presentation , documentation, minimal gaming ( lite ). Edge to edge display with every minimal bezel makes this unique at this price range.Product packaging was good, timely delivery and easy to install.",5
"First, the monitor was working properly. After an hour, some screen pixels turned green, i thought the problem was in hdmi cable. But even after removing the cable, the 'no cable detected' screen which was previously black, was ALL GREEN. After some time it again started working properly and then again turned green.
I ordered a replacement and its all good now.
Its a very nice monitor with this price range.",4
"The stand position is fixed. You cannot adjust it in any manner. No rotation, no height increase or decrease. Except one vga cable and power chord, no other cables given. Rest all is fine.",4
"Great display at this price point. 27 inch screen seems perfect and for a 1080p resolution and this big screen never pixelates when we play videos of 1080p.
It seems like a good upgrade from my previous dell 18.5 inch monitor.
When connecting via a vga cable, the clarity is not comparable to that of hdmi.
No issues otherwise.",5
A 15 amp 3 pin plug is unnecessary for a monitor. Very inconvenient as no 15 am sockets in room or office except for the Aircon‚Äôs. Makes no sense,2
"Suggest not to buy it. Adaptor do not suit india and hence it is of no use unless we again go buy different cables. But seller has a dutiy to clearly mention in his product page that they shall be selling adaptors which are non standard in India . Alongside, HDMI cables were missing too

Disappointed with this purchase",1
"Perfect monitor for work from home and office work. Height adjustment feature costs more than regular monitor but its worth considering long term use and ergonomics.

Speaker - of no use hence don't consider that as a feature. It's very low, 1w.

After 6 days use, I'm fully satisfied.",5
"Great Value Product

When I received the product, the box was damaged which was a clear indication that monitor might also be damaged and that is what exactly resulted. The monitor received was damaged as shown in the attached photo. Cleary there were quality checks missing that is the reason i got a damaged monitor.
==============
After receiving a new product via replacement, i am actually satisfied with the monitor.

Pros:
1.Auto brightness
2.Headphone Jack
3.HD resolution is enough for me as i am using mainly for work.
4.Build Quality is nice by that i mean to say is the stand is sturdy and screen doesn‚Äôt shake until and unless someone purposely shakes it.

Note- At the time of pick up of damaged monitor(which was the very next day) , the guy had already come with a new one.",5
"Update: Speaker stopped working in 3weeks.

The speakers are just a waste of resources/money. I didn't really expect good speakers, but these speakers are just there, you just hear some noise.
Other than that its an excellent monitor so far. good design, built, excellent display.

built and design = 4/5
Speaker = -1/5
display = 4/5
price = 5/5",2
"Best monitor for it's price range. I don't know how far it goes but for now amazing.
I firmly believed n rely on Amazon service as I order everything from it whenever I need online product. Basically I am a content creator. So to all those buyers looking for a good affordable monitor than this is amazing.
Thanks Amazon for keeping my trust high. Way more to go..",5
"Awesome display. 4k videos look amazing. Works for gaming too.
Supports HDMI. Comes with a cable. Can be detached from the stand so that you can fit it on the wall. Not very heavy.
Not harmful for eyes.
The only drawback is that you cannot adjust the height. The angle is adjustable though.
Overall, really cool product.",5
"Best Desktop Monitor In set budget with Eye Care, only thing which creates trouble was Sound inbuilt in it, i still dnt hear it ., neither its software installation CD works properly, rest apart, all good and a must buy from my side (excl sound issue) in the set budget ( i bought it for 6990/- )",5
"Sound is not great..being monitor cant expect much.
But has an audio port..which you can connect to speakers to enhance it.
Nice picture quality ..no eye strain..if working for long hours 6 to 8 hrs.
Given the price of 10K..for 24inch...monitor..its good perfect.

Go for it.",4
The display build quality is good and i you just want a display for basic uses then its find but if you buying if for any type of creative work then i will strongly suggest you not to buy this display the colours are not at all accurate in any or the colour profile and the blackes are very dull i bought it as a secondary screen and i have a much experience screen as my primary screen but the colours were so different in both the screen as both the screen are from the same brand Banq and it was impossible to work in that screen because of the colours.,1
"After 7 days use ! Bought it for 13500/-
Great product, I bought for my 2020 MacBook Pro 13 Inch. I bought it for official work, programming. Very good viewing angle. You can play 4K, 6k and 8k videos. Your system should be capable of playing high definition videos. Monitor is very good. There is one cons: stand is fixed, you can tilt monitor up or down , but the stand will not go up or down. But it has option for VESA mount. Overall good product for your better productivity. Go for it if you‚Äôre looking for 27 inch under 15k.",4
"AFTER USING ONE MONTH
1. GOOD PACKING 100/100
2. SEAL PACK PRODECT 100/100
3. DISPLAY COLOR & EVE CARE 100/100
4. EXTREMELY GOOD POWER CABLE 100/100
5. VGA CABLE POOR QUALITY 30/100
BAD THING IS NO HDMI & AUDIO CABLE IN THE BOX. IF YOU ARE USING VGA CABLE, YOU NEED TO BUY MALE TO MALE AUDIO CABLE FOR SOUND.",5
"Would buy this eyes open, but ears closed... You will need a separate speaker pack if you are looking for sound.. But, if you are looking for stellar visual experience, go with this excellently priced option.. Pairs well with mac laptops too, with Display-port to HDMI adaptors..",5
I did mistake by buying this product based on description. Product description is misleading on some point. Before buying this please visit to genuine Benq website and try to compare this and then buy. Monitor working fine their is no issue as of now. But fingers crossed.,4
"I ordered this monitor after so much confusion to whether go for the 27"" or 24"". I feel glad that finally I ordered 24"". For videos and may be for gaming this monitor is fine but if you are using it for browsing or text based work the resolution is not enough. Pixalisation is evident while reading texts. Never make the mistake to order 1080p 27"" display if your using it as an office monitor or ms word and Excel related work. Yes for watching videos and it may be sufficient. Also 60 hz screen refreshment rate is also not compelling. I mainly use this monitor to watch videos and do some chart analysis and this monitor does the job. For reading and ms office I still use my laptop screen as this monitor gives strain to my eyes. Overall the color reproduction is good. Blue light filter works fine.",3
"Good monitor. Not v ultra sharp. But nice.
Looks of this monitor are very cheap. Plastic like.

Can not keep this monitor on reception. Dust sticks to parts parts and looks very cheap.

Functionally this monitor is above average.",4
"After doing lot of rearch finally purchased a 24 inch monitor which is a ideal size for home and office use. For watching movies and gaming you may go for 27 and above.
The left one is 13 inch laptop, center one is BenQ 24 inch and the right ine is 19 inch old monitor",5
"Monitor is good for video editing purpose, I connected it to my laptop and screen size is almost double, Speakers are decent enough for watching movies I got it for 12049/- best monitor in this range",5
"2 quick things
1. Product is really good. Overall build quality, pictures quality, eye care feature and ambient light sensitivity and vertical display angle adjustable. No IPS backlight glare.
2. Product packaging was not that good. Monitor box was like teardown at some places which could damage the product, fortunately not this time. Please work on packaging.",5
"Just received, set up in 2-3 minutes, excellent built quality. Appears too good. Will write detailed review later.
Quick feedback:Cable routing provision is too good, snaps are too nice. They slipped in smoothly. Base strength too good. Swit he's are robust. Bezel is is too slim as BenQ promised. Amazing product.",5
"I get it and did'nt open because pendemic covid19 the package deliver address was sealed and after 2 month I open that, I am seeing it's broken and not working, so any buyer please check the product whenever you pic that and be confirmed product is working fine or not.",1
"what a masterpiece. i have bought it for my official work and long sitting , and this monitor not disappointed me.
It has an eye strain and pain control hidden feature. kidding.
you can easily use it for long hours without getting irritated.. very good , though the price is little high compare to other brands but worth buying.
Just pick the one and go for buy if you want a class in limited range.",5
"This is a very good monitor under 10k. The display is matte and non-reflective. Brightness is decent for its price. Haven't noticed any ips glow/backlight bleed yet. Colors appear quite accurate for editing. It's just a 60hz display, so not recommended for serious gamers.",5
"Excellent picture quality but the sound produced by in-built speakers are very horrible and useless. Even in full volume its sound cannot be heard from 5-6 feet distance. Look is very smart, good anti-glare screen. Overall, it is a good monitor if you don't use its audio.",4
Very happy with the product. Inordered this as working from home is now new jormal. I had shoulder paun and continuously looking down at the computer screen was increasing my shoulder and neck pain. With this screen i now now have to look straight in the screen. This does not strain my eyes. The hdmi cable is also in the box so the i stallation was super quick no extra purchases. And as usual amazon delivery was superbüëçüèª,4
"Great product at a perfect pricepoint.
The monitor is perrfect size with minimal border/bezels. The Cable management in the monitor stand/pillar hides it conpletely giving a clutter free desk.
Display is bright and vivid.
Came with an HDMI cable (although it wasn't mentioned in the package contents_",5
"This is a very nice monitor in terms of picture quality. Comes with HDMI cable, with option to connect using VGA and DP. The screen is very sharp with 81 PPI. Please dont expect this to have good sound(atleast it has in this price range).

I am using it for my laptop to work more productively, to keep eye on all application at a time is just awesome. It takes some time to get used to of this big screen, please use blu rays reduction always, else you will feel the strain a lot.",5
"The monitor has a great built quality and the picture quality is good as well. The monitor is an absolute beast and you won't feel how huge it is unless you have it. The unit that I have got has absolutely no backlit bleeding problem and has very miniscule IPS glow which is actually a good thing as all IPS displays pertains a bit of IPS glow. Moreover, Before buying I was concerned about the warranty as Amazon says that it would be 39 months from the manufacturing date or 36 months from the date of purchase whichever is closest so I was concerned that what if I would get a model that was manufactured way earlier than 2019 as the first availablity of this monitor is in 2017 but my model has a manufacturing date of MAR 2019. If I talk about the display, it is good and the built quality is top-notch. The only con of this monitor are the speakers, they are decent. Also, the product description says that the package would contain the cord and monitor and some reviews says that the power cord provided is not Indian style but in my case it turned out false, and the package also include the HDMI cable so no need to buy HDMI cable along with it.",5
"At this price, this monitor is good value for money. It is perfect for most home and office uses. With the thin bezel it feels really big. It would have been better if the height of the stand was adjustable. But the very large viewing angle compensates for this.",5
"I purchased it on last May and the monitor is more than what I expected. I am a UI UX designer and I was in search for a good monitor which is best one for ma budget. And at last found few of them. In which I purchased the BenQ monitor. If you are only having a full HD laptop then 24 inch monitor is the best. It's good for Designing. It's having the best aspect Ratio. Quality is also good. Colors are nice. Best experience for design, gaming, movies etc. Inbuilt speaker is not good. Rest it have 1Display port, 1 hmdi port, 1 vga port. I give it 5 star for the budget monitor in the 24 inch segment includes every features. üëç",5
"Super monitor for gamers, developers, movie watchers.
I just plugged in my sundirect set-top box to the monitor. It's working without any set. The inbuilt speakers works perfect. So we can use it as TV as well.",5
"It's been 2 days I'm using the monitor and it's awesome.. it is so big that i can see 4 documents on screen at the same time.. i haven't checked the eye care functionality or anything else yet from the menu buttons on the screen as the default setting itself looks wonderful.. i got it for Rs. 12200 approx and there is nothing out there better than this at this price. I've purchased this strictly for working from home, so my review is not based on how it performs while gaming..",5
"Amazing budget monitor. I got the 24 inch which was perfect for my small table. I mostly use it for coding and the text is sharp and visible.

In order to get the most benifits, you do need to change the default settings a bit and customize to your preference. You'll be able to find YouTube videos and guides online on how to get the best picture quality.

I've also really appreciated the auto-brightness feature which adapts the brightness to the amount of light in the environment. It's not always perfect but you can tweak the sensitivity in the settings.

Overall a great monitor for the price. Will definitely recommend.",5
"Not for gaming, not for full HD movies. There is pixelation if u want to see great 4k videos and pics... U should choose little higher resolution... 2500 not 1080",3
"Monitor much more than I imagined.. I have been using, HP, LG monitors earlier but after using this BenQ for close to 3 months i found its really good. Its Easy to use, awesome picture quality , modes to adjust along with features like anti glare..

Few minor tweks can be taken care here, Inbuilt speakers audio is bit lower, quality of power cable, this could have been better.. Still giving 5 star because of the price point and sleeky design.",5
Got successful delivery of the product 2 days before the scheduled date. Monitor is in perfect condition and looks are great for such a budget and brand. I am using the dual Monitor arm and managed to get it hinged in less than few minutes. It has got lot of menu options to configure. I dont play games on it as i already have a ps4 pro so wont be able to comment on gaming experience. overall product is much recommended,4
"Size of this monitor is good enough for home / office use. It's an excellent product baring the sound. Sound clarity isn't loud enough to hear clearly. I haven't played any games on it but for watching films, home / office use it's an excellent pick. Above all the price is affordable. Probably at this price you may not get AMD sync, clear and crisp sound. But it has eye care technology which is very useful for those use this for home / office use. Make note though it has HDMI port, HDMI cable isn't included in the package.",5
"Best monitor under 8000rs (better than Acer nitro and Samsung).

pons: blue light filter
best IPS display that looks soo rich and 3d
Very DECENT eye-watering brightness.
Normal speakers.
border-less.
works great on the inverter.
cons: very bad fking response time (5ms) +Ghosting.
(u will notice even if ur not techy, but for me, display quality is better than response time.)

info: I have also used gw2280
Suggestion: add 1500rs to your budget and u will get a better monitor with good response and the same quality as this monitor have.",5
"I purchased this monitor and within 20 hours I got it's delivery.

The product seems worth to the money I have spent.

However, the power connection cable I got has a bigger plug which can't be supported with my spike guard or home sockets as it's not a standard for Indian house
This monitor either be shipped with the correct cable for Indian houses or with the conversion adapter.

A bit disappointment.

I had to use the cable from my old monitor.",1
"I love to work on it at night.
During the day its a nightmare. I have to put the curtains to block the sunlight, else i can't see anything on the screen even with maximum brightness. üòî",4
"I bought it as a part of the whole Work from Home situation due to Coronavirus scare. I am a Technical Analyst and I usually look at live market data and Charts on this monitor and have a laptop for comms. Image quality is crisp and clear and post market I can even enjoy a good FULL HD movie or TV show thanks to 2 HDMI ports where I connected my Chrome cast.

The various modes for color adjustments are brilliant as you can see the changes real-time and change it from work to fun in couple of seconds.",5
"This is a must have wfh component for any developer. The screen is made of a high quality panel and is anti glare.
The usp for me however is excellent portrait mode which helps me to see more code.
Thin bezels is always a welcome.
I got hdmi cable in the box which was an unexpected surprise.
Couple this with Amazon basics monitor stand and this is an amazing productivity booster.
P.S There is a small sticker at the back which say made in China for for Benq in Taipei. One of the reasons that I bought it was because it said manufactured in Taiwan. Amazon please update.",5
"Installed , 27/3/2018, loved the bezeless screen, it is beautiful, 1920 x 1080 display is fantastic after installing DVI-D to HDMI cable on 28/03/2018, i dont feel like leaving the monitor, 24 inch is just perfect as it fits my desk especially the height and width, good that my old 22 inch monitor {Brand: Datamini} was / is not repariable, Benq GW 2480 is blessing in disguise.",5
"I faced issues with its brightness. After using it for an hour, I started feeling discomfort in my eyes. I have reduced brightness, contract and then also set it its brightness intelligence but nothing worked out. There was burning sensatio to my eyes just after few minutes of sitting. Finally I returned the product. Not sure the issue is with model or the product which I have received. I'm now looking for other brands like LG, samsung, HP and Dell. I just went for this model after seeing 10k reviews and overall good raring but I had terrible experience with the monitor.",2
"Excellent features for the price
With two hdmi ports and one vga port,one audio port
The good thing is that it has built-in speakers
But which sounds average
It has auto brightness function for the price
And it has more features for this price",5
"Best product in its segment. Superb
Picture quality. Go for it without any hesitation. 09/10 from my side. 01 for sound because its very low. Almost nothing. Rest are awesome.",5
"I was super easy to set up. The cable holder at the back helps to keep the wires neat. I'm happy with 'tilt' option which is more than enough for my needs. Haven't had any display problems for the past month since I've purchased this monitor. My one peeve is that it's a bit cumbersome to change the settings and I switch between reading, multimedia and web surfing multiple times. I guess that's a small price to pay for a monitor that comes at such a low price and excellent value.",5
"One of the best monitors.

Excellent quality of contrast, wide viewing angles.

Top notch IPS panel.

I do not know how it suits for gaming as I use it for office work. But It can be a trusted versatile product.

Thanks Amazon for providing such top notch products.",5
The monitor has 16 amp socket and non returnable. It will not fit in multi pin plug. So only two option is if you have a 16 amp socket or you use a converter for 16amp to 6 amp so that it fits with multi pin socket. Later is highly risky as it will lead to power failure or short circuit. Not able to return it on day 1 itself,1
"The eycare technology and the Adaptive Brightness are the main takeaways. Ever simce i changed to this monitor the dark circles and redness in the eyes have reduced very noticeably.
It is a good monitor for gaming purposes and the picture quality is also great. The speaker on this monitor are not that loud but they do the job. Who uses monitor speakers anyway?
The black is not that black in this monitor or maybe some settings are needed to be done. Prefer this monitor at this price over other overrated monitors.",5
"Worst and faulty...the resolution looks blurry right from first day, I don't even have option to return it now as dur to being out of town I checked it after end date, I have purchased benq monitor earlier which was good. So I thought this should be good too .I am stuck with a faulty monitor now which I can't use",1
"I was in dilemma between samsung curved monitor and this. Chose this over samsung due to speakers, dual HDMI, TUV SUD certified blue screen. Writing this after 2 months of usage. A good product with ambient lighting and appropriate blue filter based on time of the day and surrounding. You can config for office or gaming etc. My prime usage is of office spreadsheet and videos from Netflix,Prime etc",5
I‚Äôve been using this monitor for more than 2 years now. And I must say its a very nice monitor for all kinds of usage. I mainly run graphic design softwares like adobe photoshop and illustrator and this monitor produces very good colours which are important in my work. Full HD videos and Gaming grapgic is also very nice. At this price this monitor is steal. I‚Äôm pretty happy with my purchase!,4
The picture quality is nice. I do not have any complain for its display section. However I have failed to use its audio system. I have tried to get output from the speaker using my available devices. It failed to give any sound when the input is given through its hdmi port or audio line-in jack. It appears to me that there is some fault in the section that implements the audio system. It is my suggestion to viewers that you should check both the video and audio system before giving any rating to it.,2
"Picture quality is great, viewing angles are great. The controls are accurate.

2 areas of improvement:
Built in speaker sound quality isn't good. The sound levels are really low.
Why does this monitor come with a 16a socket? Had to replace the power cable.",4
"The product itself is good and hence this is my second order... but still I returned the product.
Please please read this before you buy. This comes with a power chord which is pretty big generally used for high voltage equipments like geyser. This power chord will not fit to normal switch board so it has following drawbacks
1. It cannot be used where ever you want as such high voltage switch boards are not generally be installed
2. Even if you use a bigger switch board typically ups will not be compatible so when power is cutoff monitor won't work
3. An additional adapter may be required if you still want to keep",1
"Model is good.. If keep setting good its worth it..
Durability part felt outer frame is very simple not sturdy.. Plastic like it even let led come out.. Not scary but wasn't so hard sticked like.

Sound.. U need output speaker if desire good audio sound.

Text part reading is easy and nice considering eye feature.. But use settings of contrast for crisper texts

Surely worth considering for 24inch one. Can buy",4
"Pros.
1) anti glare
2) automatic brightness control function
3) audio in and out

Cons.
1) not a sharpen image
2) districting ips glow
3) colours not uniform from left to right screen. (When watching a white screen, left side more yellow tint and right side screen blue tint)
4) very low speaker volume",3
"The color reproduction is quite poor. However, the overall quality is decent for regular office work, but not for gaming / entertainment / graphic processing.
The size is quite large. 24 inch would've been a better fit for home office setups.
Benq drivers are not available for download on Benq website either.

Amazon delivery was very good, but there is no option to return because of poor picture quality.",3
"I already have benq 24 inch ips ...but this one is phenomenal with wire management system and eye care ....amazon must be thanked for guidance as i has gone haywire with so many options available .....this is the best monitor for eye care and it is recommended to save up rather than go for similar cheaper options .

Audio out with sony headphones is studio like .

As for screen size ....it is breathtaking ...no 4k led tv can even come close to it .

Thank you amazon from an old customer",5
The monitor came well packaged. The entire monitor box was placed inside a much more larger box to minimise the damage during transportation. The quality of the monitor itself is above average. The stand is plastic covered. Inside there is strong metal reinforcements. Eventhought the bezels are thin there is a black border around the display panel through which the cursor still pass through. I think this is the most affordable 27 inch ips display available online.,5
"Good product.
Doesn't come with HDMI cable. Looks clunky and old fashioned.
Has sound output port in addition to the passable built-in speakers.
Controls are ill placed and difficult to use. Impossible to read the labels on the controls, so hang on to the manual.",4
"HDMI Cable wasn't there they changed the cable with VGA why I ordered this monitor because my card doesn't have VGA cable option , so i need screen which is operating with HDMI, I already have VGA Cables , Not Happy with the seller",1
"The best monitor at this price range which is very much impressive.

Just go for it it's built quality is good and picture quality is awsome.

But unfortunately I didn't have the HDMI pin to check but hwne I checked after two days the screen had red lines and have placed hand in hand replacement.

Hoping to get a correct one",5
"It is enough big size monitor to work at home or office. Colours are good, text is crisp and clear and most important I feel is Auto brightness adjustment feature, It is very useful when you are working in low light, if you are graphic designer and concerned about colours you can keep it off. Cable management system is very good. Only con is it's base is not sturdy.",5
"This monitor is really awesome.
Even small fonts are clear, there is no strain on the eyes. Its eye-care technology really works.
The screen is anti-reflective. Different modes for reading, blue light, multimedia etc are beneficial.
Five stars from my side to this monitor.",5
"Using since few months and no issues found, great quality of display and 24‚Äù is more than sufficient for all kind of work. Got Deal at attractive price of @8.6K. Built in speakers are not loud enough, need to add additional speakers.
Thanks Amazon and Benq!",5
Flickers and hirts eyes and not good build,1
"No doubt about the product. Perfect for home office.
Amazon service .. top notch. I had order for the 27 inch model but I was delivered a 24 inch. Contacted amazon customer service and within 1 hr, my initial order was cancelled and a new order was raised to deliver the 27 inch model. Super fast delivery. The same day the item was shipped and I received the product today, 3 days !!.
Bezos, you have set the topmost standards of customer satisfaction. Right now, nobody can beat that. Well done boys.",5
"It comes with power and VGA cable. The stand is sturdy and vertical angle can be adjustable. comes with hdmi and audio port as well.
The screen is wide and amazingly beautiful.
I use it for office as well as gaming.
I haven't used its speaker yet.
Overall, a pocket friendly purchase as it delivers what it promises.
Blue light filter is spot on.

P.S. The power cable had 16amp pin, which is absolutely unnecessary, I connected it with 6 amp pin cable and it is working fine.",5
"Plus:
Monitor looks sleek
Multiple brightness modes
Can tilt vertically to some extent

Minus:
16 amp plug. Can be hard to find a matching plug point
Speaker volume very low. speakers are unusable",3
"It's been 3 days since I have been using this monitor. 24 Inch is a good size for office work, the bezels less design gives a very premium look. The display is crisp, colours good, adjustable blue light. Speakers are not up to the mark in terms of sound output, but, I guess that's hat you would expect from integrated speakers. I have external speakers any way.",5
"This monitor is a very good one.
I have just unboxed the item. (The same day I am writing)
All the features are good.

But only 1 disadvantage:- it's 3 pin power adapter is too large to fit in a standard socket. 15 Ampere plug is needed. (Probably its power requirement is large in comparison to other standard computer monitor).

Possibly it can never be powered from any ups directly. (Another extension chord is needed.)
So, in case of power failure computer can not be used (even for few minutes).
This feedback will be edited later on. (Possibly after couple of years).",5
"While this may work well for a Desktop PC setup, the monitor is NOT COMPATIBLE as an external display screen for a retina display device. The text becomes blurry. Also, there is no option on this monitor to disable the eye-care features (which aren't really needed in daylight) making the screen yellowish all the time.",3
"It‚Äôs a good monitor has intelligent brightness control, which is good for extended working hrs.
24‚Äù screen size suitable for use as a 2nd screen or you can use like main screen: need to connect separate keyboard to monitor.
Monitor has inbuilt speakers quality is 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è",5
"Nice picture. Good quality. Worth. Easy assembly and no tools required. Only different thing observed is the 16A plug.
I thought it fits in normal household plug. But the powerplug is bigger and did not fit. I bought multi plug and then fits this one. Good to buy",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 After two years of use, the screen is flickering.",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Monitor is just amazing.
It is quite heavy and feels sturdy . Picture quality is great and eye Care technology works good . I use it for long hours daily and it smartly adjust blf and brightness automatically. It is better than any monitor out there in the market as I have myself seen and used most of them. It is even a lot more better than it's LG competitor.

For me it has no cons. Using it from last 3 months.",5
"This is my 3rd Benq monitor in last 4 years. Due to study/work from home I needed 3rd monitor now to ensure everyone is using big enough screen. Product is good but when I raised support call for my previous monitor, same model, which I bought last year support turned out to be pathetic.",1
"Good Monitor.
I bought 24"" Monitor.
Picture clarity is Very Good.
Supports VGA & HDMI Input.
It has inbuilt Speakers, activated only when HDMI input is given.
Though it has inbuilt speakers, sound is very low.
Overall its a VFM Product from BENQ!",5
"Great monitor for the price. I could achieve a massive +27 hz overclock (with some tweaking in nvidia control panel) bringing the refresh rate to 87 hz which is amazing for the price, but maybe not every monitor can do that and I just got lucky. Certainly expect ~75 hz overclocks at 1080p for this monitor for any unit at least, which would be much better for PC gaming.

Now, picture quality is another deal, everything except color temperature was fine on my unit. I had an awful red tint on mine, but with the built in color temperature settings I could offset that pretty well using my galaxy s8's much better calibrated screen as a template and going by eye. Not everybody will have something like that or the patience to correct it themselves, so picture quality gets a 3.5/5 for me, because it seems like a lottery on who will get a correctly tinted monitor. (P.S. BenQ has a color profile in their website for this model, which helped reduce the tint and make it more accurate by a little bit in windows, but definitely not as good as 'correct' looking as a manual calibration by eye in my opinion, and it also doesn't work if you use a console as a second input or just something without .icc color profile support)

Brightness is, well, as good as you'll get at this pricepoint. It's as bright as my older but more expensive Acer monitor, maybe 'bright' isn't the right word for it, but it gets the job done even in a well lit room for my use case.

Even with the tint issue, I personally think this thing deserves a 4 stars solely due to the value proposition, but in my case, with such a massive boost in refresh rate, I think 5 stars is well deserved.",5
"It took me a while to select this and seems to do the job just fine. I have tried both 1080p HDMI and 1080p VGA connections to the MacBook Pro laptop. The box includes HDMI cable. It wasn't clear in the description, now I have two HDMI cables.",5
"Very good quality product, excellent performance. As compared to other branded monitors available in the market, this model definitely scores much better and higher value, in terms of its reasonable pricing and the features it has vis-a-vis other brands. one can definitely go for it without any doubt.",4
"This is a great monitor in terms of display , build quality and eye strain reduction. Great for programming display and gaming or even video/photo editing because there are various levels of adjustments provided in the display.The contrast is very slightly dull. The box doesnt contain an hdmi cable- only vga - No clue why.. Almost all laptops have given up vga .",5

"I‚Äôm using it for office purpose, writing this review after a month. If you are looking for 24 inches Monitor just go for it. This product will not disappoint you. Picture quality is best and it‚Äôs anti glare. I‚Äôve search many product but this is best. Special system for cable routing as well.
Not used for gaming purpose.",5
"I am using 2 x 27' monitors
- BenQ GW2780 (1080p)
- HP z27n G2 (4K)

The performance on both the display is on par with each other.
- Crisp and clear images
- Soft on eye and comfortable for long use
- Low Blue light tech makes it really smooth for eyes
- Super slim bezels make the viewing experience amazing
- great gaming experience
- worth every single penny",5
"It‚Äôs almost 3 months and I‚Äôm not facing any issue, good colours, nice viewing angle, response is also very good, speakers are also good, almost 3x sound than my laptop speakers i don't know yours, speakers quality is fine and not more than this you can expect from a monitor speakers, better than any small Bluetooth speakers of range 400-800‚Çπ",5
"We have purchased quite a number of these for use at our company. The team loves them, however the last two came with 16A power plug, this plug only fits in our AC outlet. So we end up having to purchase a power cord separately from the monitor. Very inconvenient, and extreme over kill for a monitor that probable uses 1 amp.

In the pic the plug on the left is what came with last two monitors, plug on right is what our normal office outlet takes.

In the future we will be purchasing a different brand, hopefully one that comes with a power cord that works in our office.",1
"I usually use this monitor for study purpose but I do play games in between,recently I played cyberpunk what I have noticed is it does not produce very sharp image but it's not a big deal for a casual gamer like me this monitor has yellowish tint what makes it really soothing for eyes . The brightness adjustment feature serves it's purpose as it very accurate and sensitive . If you are not a hard-core gamer this monitor is just fine for you and last thing to keep in mind is that 24"" variant is perfect for 1080p resolution .",5
"theyveven don't know what power cable shold shipped. they sent 15 A pin. which is generally don't fit on general socket.

i wasted my money",1
"Using for programming and its more than enough.
For moderate gaming this will work
Con
Only issue is , power cable has power plug which is 16A plug which does not fit in normal indian sockets but you can also order power adapter and it will work. See photo for power plug and adapter.",4
Picture Quality is awesome. Photos may not justify picture quality. Sound output is also very good. For console gaming it is good at 60hz refresh rate. Can't notice any input lag. No deadpixel till now. Sturdy build quality. Text is crisp and clear. Anti glare is just awesome don't have any kind of reflection. Better to manually adjust brightness & picture mode for better experience.,5
So far so good..... No flickering... No colour bleeding..... Stand is brilliant.... Loving the size upgrade from 22 to 27.... And no heating issues.... Over all brilliant üëç ..... But I have used it for only a month...... Hence opinions can change......,5
"I must say, I am very delighted with this monitor. It took me small time to assemble by self, it looks so nice, non offensive beautiful design.

I have been using monitors since 21 years but this one looks special",5
"Been using it for wfh for long hours and happy so far. Picture quality is great, better than LG monitors.
Audio port volume is very low, but I wouldn‚Äôt expect a monitor to have good sound in this range.
Has auto off feature if you forget it On which is nice.",5
"I recently bought my third BENQ 27 Inches, Monitor.

Every time, when I decide to buy a monitor as an extension to my Laptop/Mac, the choice is simple. Just come to Amazon and place an order for BENQ 27"" Monitor. I don't even look for something else. It's so nice to work every day for 12-16 hr daily without any issues on this monitor.

I highly recommend to anyone who is working from home to have this must-have accessory to productive prolonged work life. Just go for it!",5
"I have been looking for a large monitor for WFH. Previusly used smaller BenQ 19inch and served me well for years, still working. The 27inch monitor GW2780 is a VFM choice compared to other brands. Using it in Low bluelight mode ""Reading"" mode. I found this is best suitable for daily work purpose. But for multimedia or movie other high brightness mode may be more suitable. Overall I recommend this monitor anyone upgrading from 22 or 24inches.",5

I have played YouTube videos via any cast 480p quality is good & 720p amazing.
Extremely good quality in cheap price. I have got it for Rs.7830/- 24 inch model (GW2480)
Just buy a HDMI Splitter. I am using as TV with Tata Sky HD connection & as a monitor & by any cast as smart TV.
It has 3.5mm audio out port for headphone & Bluetooth speaker & home theatre connection. Also has audio in 3.5mm.
It has many display pre set mode as TV. Monitor stand is very good & also wall mountable.
I am not a gamer and I have no idea as gamming display for this monitor.",5
"The features mentioned in the product description are all matching except I didn't received the HDMI cable. The operating buttons are good and the menu is also user friendly. I don't play much game's so can't write on that.
Sound quality is ok compared to one watt.",4

This product is in ""Amazon Choice"", so bought this, now so many problems. Please help Amazon.
I'm a regular customer of Amazon..usually experiences were good only.",1
The monitor is very good for the price. But dont expect more. It has its own disadvantages in terms of display resolution by design. 1080p in 27 inch will be okayish. Proceed only if u desperately want a big monitor. I used it for personal computing and found it difficult.,3
"This product has got misleading information. The description says there is a Display port, a VGA and HDMI, whereas there was a VGA and 2 HDMI. I had to separately buy a DP to HDMI connector.",4
Received Damaged Piece. Waste of Money.,1
"I bought the product primarily for work. It‚Äôs definitely very useful and a great buy, but a 22‚Äù monitor may be slightly more comfortable. That said, the text is clear and the connection with my Mac is seamless and took all of two minutes to set up, so it‚Äôs still been a very positive experience. The reviews about the speakers are accurate though - very low sound, even at max volume. Not too great if you don‚Äôt have separate speakers and wanted this to double as a Netflix watching screen.",4
"Nice product. Packing from Benq is robust so it doesn't get damaged during shipping.

Picture quality is good. Sharpness is setting on lower side, small text are slightly blur.

Auto brightness adjustment set brightness slightly on higher side.

Overall good product.",5
"Used benq for many years in the past. I was skeptical of the quality of this monitor considering no other brand had this kind of aggressive pricing, but this one is totally worth it and perfect for someone working long hours.",5
"Amazing clarity. Spending around three times duration with this EnergyStar rated Eye-Care monitor, when compared with my old LG- HD LED-Backlit 18.5 inch monitor. Another nice thing is that, the monitor is well designed to accommodate cables, two extra HDMI slots and an engineered stand.",5
"Overall fantastic purchase.
Clarity is really good.
Speakers are also of decent quality. Although voice does not go that high but according to speaker size it is good.
Viewing angles are good.
No issue so far. No screen bleeding nothing. I bought dell ips as well but it was bleeding so I returned. This is far better than dell. Eye care technology is a great add on in this monitor. Go for it !!",4
"The monitor is pretty good. Meets the color and resolution expectations. Looks elegant and functions well. The monitor has a built in speaker. Audio quality is not good for music. However it makes it very convenient for listening to simple audio.

The trouble we had was with the power cord. They had shipped a power cord with 15A plug. What is needed for all home appliances is a cord with 5A plug since most of the sockets are 5A sockets. Amazon refused to replace the cord.

We had to buy the power cord separately.",4
"Go for it .better than lg and other similar brands
It is sturdy : Crisp images:allow split screen has 2 hdmi
Speakers are not good but audio out is provided
Works perfect in screen share and most imp matte and anti glare with eye saver tech...a total vfm product ..netflix and hdr not checked pls cnfrm if u require ....as i didn't....hope this helps..yes thanks amazon...",5
"If your a gamer just search for the same size model from BENQ with VA panel instead of it , coz it's frequency rate is 60hz and response time 5ms . Other than gamers whoever you may be no matter what the purpose is just go for it . By far the best of best monitor especially for graphic designers coz it has a brilliant color settings and picture quality . Being an artist myself , fell in love with BENQ the movement I saw my logo on the start of windows .",5
"I am writing this after using for more than a week, the sound is not great, but is ok for every day use, the picture quality is really excellent also a very good viewing angle, I find nothing to complain about, please remember you will require a 16 amp socket for the plug, do arrange that if you buy this one.",5
"I purchased product based on Reviews only,
I really appreciate to true reviewers.
Although, my 1st product was defective might because of some issues,
So I exchanged my product with same model.
And it's really worth it.
This is best screen in this range for pocket friendly, unmatched quality, and Anti glare surface.",5
"Not as good as it could be. I use it as extended monitor for my laptop for coding. You can see the pixels at curves for letters.
Although it as ambiance sensor in place but that doesn't optimize brightness to ease your eveys.

It my fit for light for some work when you are not required to be focused on the screen for longer duration",2
"I was looking for a better 22"" monitor in this price range, could not get better than this BenQ monitor.
Display quality is overall good, build is solid and you can work for a longer time like 10-12 hours easily without stressing out your eyes, sound quality is poor and one more concern is they do not provide HDMI cable instead they provide VGA. Overall if you are only looking for a monitor in less than 8K price range. this is the one.!",5
"The monitor works best for usual day to day official work. Colour and Brightness are good. It is not a gaming monitor, hence do not expect a high refresh rate. Overall the build quality is great. It is not truly bezel-less. I am attaching pictures taken of my two monitors kept side by side. The left one is Benq and the right one is LG LED.
You can say it is a thin bezel, but still, there is an overall 1cm gap between the actual screen and the outside edges of the monitor.
In all cases, you can go for it considering the price.",5
"Picture quality is ok.
Only issue is the sound output from inbuilt speaker and audio out port of speaker.
As expected speaker volume is low but surprisingly the audio from the audio out port is also very low.
If you want to use audio out port of monitor, avoid this product.",3
"Quite Sturdy.. Cable management is neat..FHD is good for reviewing excel file on big screen...YouTube videos look pretty decent.

inbuilt speaker are pretty basic. Excellent monitor in the price range.",5
"I bought 2 different model(Hp/benq)27"" monitors and both had some serious light bleeding issues so I returned it.and seller refunded immediately. it that was great. after I bought this one. this one surprised me. No light bleeding. Picture quality is great. Minimum light reflection. Auto brightness works perfectly. 1080p is good.. 2k would be perfect if they launch it in future with reasonable price.",4
Great product from Benq. Guys go for it blindly. Such a quality monitor. Brightness is extraordinary. I was using Acer LCD monitor since 2009. For the first time I'm using IPS monitor. Great difference i can see from both. I'm loving and using daily. Matte finish display is an advantage thay doesn't affect ur view from sunlight through window. Previously i have that issue. Now no issues with this Matte finish display.,5
"The picture quality is amazing.
It does not hurt your eyes. It has ambient light sensor, it does change the brightness automatically based on the room light. This is amazing feature, it is not available similar cost range monitors.",5
"I bought this BenQ 22"" IPS display monitor its been a week now and I'm noticing screen flickers at center of the screen while playing videos. Is this normal? Or is that a defect. It pixelated as well. It was so quick so to take a pic was very challenging, and after shot 40-60 pic able to find couple of pics with the mentioned defects. It's hard to find.",2
"This a good product. The only down side is its sound quality. Though it comes with 2 HDMI and one VGA ports, which is perfect for me. it would have been great value for money if it would have a good sound quality.",3
"Looks dimmer if viewed from side angle but not the colour.
Built quality is very good when compared with Samsung.
The stand design is also very nice and took less than 10 minutes to assemble and install.
Very good for office use. Nice warm view.",5
One of the best 24 inch monitor in this price range. Picture quality is decent. Refresh rate is satisfactory for moderate gamers. I use it for editing works. Auto brightness feature is not too helpful but it's OK. Bezel is very thin which looks great. But there is some gap between the screen and the plastic cover which can accumulate dirt over time. But overall this is the best monitor under 10K I could get after doing a lot of research online.,4
My idea was to build my dream rig a triple monitor setup so I went through a lot of research and decided to go for BenQ 27 inch ips (since I am gamer/digital concept artist/content creator) but soon I learned that this 27 inch is too much for 1080p resolution. this monitor has good viewing angle and no problem with panel or anything but be a smarter choice would be 24 inch insted of 27 because the image feels stretched (by the way works great with my PS4 slim),5
"I am writing review after usage of a month.
The monitor is very good and display is awesome.

Value for the price and no issues.
I like Connection options, display, and
In-built speakers.

You can blindly purchase this.",5
Very nice monitor. Has simple and best features. Simple options to navigate and do the setup. It's been 2months I have been using this monitor for my WFH setup.,4
"After 1.5 month review.

Monitor is good, but if you are audio required then look for another monitor, since audio is not really good, otherwise in this price monitor is good, we got damaged audio speakers, but after follow-up with service team for our audio, they given us new monitor, service is good. They will carry in new monitor in your home.

hope Benq will improve the sound quality also. Then this will become best monitor in affordable range.",5
"I was looking for a HD desktop for Resbperry pi 4 and also for #AmazonFireStick. Researched and compare many leading brand and finally opted fro this at Rs.7990.
Delivered bit kate as came from Assam. It's working very fine on both the devices.",5
"Very good picture quality, well built for the price. Nearly borderless screen, good color rendering.
No hdmi cable was provided. Also the power cord is bit short for my liking. Menu button quality could have been better.
Overall, a very good product for the price point.",5
"The monitor is a great purchase at an affordable price range. Nice look and feel. The only downside are the inbuilt speakers, they are good for basic use like watching a video. But at least they have inbuilt speakers, other companies do not provide them at this price. Overall this is a pretty good monitor for the price.",4
"I have been using this screen from 2-3 weeks now and I found this very useful and less stressful for my daily work(`9hrs) and coding etc.
I can not comment on gaming but I guess go for a higher refresh rate monitor for that.

Blue light filter is very good and no ficker I have observed so far.

HDMI cable does not come with 22 inch one but you can get it from amazon additionally.",5
"I found deadpixel in my unit then i replaced the product sill the replacement unit has dead pixel, that's disappointing. The picture quality is great but as i know the consumer never prefers adjisting with a defective product while paying full amount, That sucks....second time i just stopped returning it didn't wanna go through the hussel...",3
I have been using this monitor from around last 2 months. It is very good for regular purpose. It is not meant for and I have not used it for Gaming so can not comment.,4
Having a problem of ghosting within a month of purchase. Didn't expect this after all the great reviews on Amazon.,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Sorry for the background noise for the price point it delivers what it promises.

I‚Äôm not a gamer tried playing few games and not that great but definitely not lagging.

Value for money.",5
"Received this item on 30/06/2020, the item is very good in terms of the monitor. The size is also adequate. Size greater than this like 24"" monitor or 27"" monitor becomes very big. This can not be used as TV because of two reasons. The first reason is inbuilt speakers are not of good quality and level is also quite low. The second reason is it is a monitor so it does come with a remote to change input source from HDMI1 to HDM2 or to VGA, so, you need to change the input source by clicking on buttons below the monitor.",4
"I am always doing coding for more than 8 hrs, and it was very tough for my eyes. So I tried this display.
This display really awesome, you will never feel strain in your eyesüòç.
The picture quality is also great.
You can go for it, it will be surely beneficial for your usage.",5
"It is not good for photo realistic don't listen to dumber iam rigrating . Go for hp 22kd it is better.
Benq screen pixels are clearly visible cause 3d image like painted on cloth.
It is not like your mobile screen.",2
"I have the opinion that this monitor is best for all purposes( for gaming, web search surf and movie watch etc). The prime factor is the price which is relatively lower than other brands. This IPS LED monitor is worth buying.",5
"Only one wall mount nut present on the back , other three not present. Cannot wall mount it now.

Careless manufacturing!!!

Despite mentioning to support VESA wall mount on Amazon, BENQ support refusing to fix this manufacturing defect.",1
"Got one dead pixel, and there is a bleeding issue also if one sees carefully, but ordered a replacement, will update the review after getting it...
Update: I've returned the monitor, as the second monitor was worse than first, and one thing I noticed in both of them is my eyes were getting strained after little use, as text was not that much sharper. If you want you can go for a 24 or 22-inch variant in this monitor as the FHD resolution is not enough for 27-inch screen.",3
"Product looks good only cons I see if it doesn‚Äôt have inbuilt mic and doesn‚Äôt provided VGA cable instead HDMI cable is given which is fine though
Brightness is good and the sound quality is moderate and not that effective otherwise all looks good",5
"This is one of the best monitors for the price .
Pros
1) Inbuilt speakers
2) Sensor for automatically sensing background light
3) Quality and built is good

Cons
1) Adjustable height could be good feature",5
"Works well, speaker quite useless, I wonder why they bothered to put that in.
I'm satisfied with it, though my use is really as an extra screen to put on when having an internal presentation in our office, so not very critical.",4
"I used to love BenQ monitors from long back. I migrated from viewsonic monitor to BenQ. I went through lot of monitors LG, Samsung and Aoc. But the quality and features offered from BenQ are at par when compared to others. This monitor is for daily use for browsing, reading and gaming. Thin bezel makes the monitor looks great.",4
"Got it few days ago. I have to say that its a bang for buck monitor. With a bit of tweak I am getting close to accurate colors. Watching movies on this is an amazing experience. You can also play games but if you don't want that latency of 5ms then go for other monitors, otherwise it's a really good monitor in this price segment.

Just go for it.",5
"I'm using it for work from home and the picture quality seems good. There is some slight screen bleeding on the edges, but are acceptable for this price range.",4
"Very good monitor for the price. Does not strain the eye and size is apt.
Not for coders who may want to use it vertically and also because the text is not amazingly sharp (4/5).

This is the second BenQ in our office and so far no complaints about reliability whatsoever.",4
"First of all I am happy that it is not a chinese product. I am using this monitor since aug 2019 and I am satisfied with this Product. I was using similar Product in my office that's why I ordered this one as it has great colors and a good picture quality. Lookwise it is a great product . In my opinion there is no competitor in this price range with a bezelless screen.

If you are planning to buy ""JUST GO FOR IT"".",5
"Good one. Best monitor for work from home.
If you connect through hdmi, laptop or PC will transfer audio to monitor. Sound quality is not sufficient. But, I always use headset for attending meetings. So, not a problem for me.
Better go for wall mount, you need to buy Vesa stand seperately. Quality of display is awesome",4
"The monitor is good for attending online class. The stand which allows for the height adjustment, tilt, rotate is awesome. The package seal was opened on arrival. But the contents were intact.",4
"I'm used to 27 inch HP 4k monitors at office. Needed something similar for home. Although not 4k, this screen is just perfect- sleek in looks, big screen and comparatively cheaper than most others. The bezels are incredibly thin and give a matt look. Only concern that the neck height is not adjustable which you can fix by keeping it on a stand or a book if you want to.",5
"Hight adjustable is good , changing to Portrait mode is essay.
i am using this screen for office purpose, from short distance so i have made bright to 0% still i have a very clear visibility . Nice product .

if you are not looking for Hight adjustable and portrait mode we can go for GW2480 has the same features",5
"Like
- good 24 inches screen with good quality images
- anti blur screen
- less strain on eyes
Dislike
- poor quality of plastics",4
"within a month i have faced power board issue so monitor was not switching on... (after buying please register for warranty with Benq) gave complaint to Benq, benq rectified the problem. monitor ran smoothly for 2 months, now today again monitor is giving horizontal lines.... i again need to contact Benq now... If you want to buy Benq, then be ready to face these quality issues.",1
"After a month i have issue with display and i registered a call with Benq and product was collect. After that i never had any updates from them. When called CC they say we have escalated the ticket and you will get a call back in 24 Hours. Tried email, no response. I regret buying this product for there worst service. I have been waiting for the status from 3 weeks.",1
"First impression...looks a good product for a desktop and general use In the house for a decent screen size.
Packaging pretty good , all components neatly packed
MOST IMPORTANT...delivered before time",4
"I need to switch displays many times ... if this feature was one button press .. I would have given it five star rating.
I also have Samsung P2350 .. where display switching is very very easy ... just one touch.",4
"-Ticks of all the right boxes that one expects from a monitor
-Anti glare and in built low blue light working as expected
-Picture quality is quite good.
-Any one who needs a good monitor for general purpose office work can go ahead buy this without any issues.",5
This is one of the cheaper IPS panel monitors available in the market today. The display itself is good and quite pleasant to the eye. However one of the drawbacks is the inbuilt 2 x 1 watt speakers which is very very low in volume and barely audible. So I had to buy external speakers just to circumvent this problem.,4
"First monitor i got manufacture defect piece on top right corner edge light bleed in every black
scene but after replacement I got proper product thanks for amazon I am getting replacement in 10 days.2nd monitor have no issue work well .picture quality is also good color look like natural.not for gaming purpose eye care is also good üëçfor programming i purchased gw2780t this is lcd monitor dont expect too much this price point",5
"The picture quality is ok. If you are using it with a laptop/computer, most of them have the anti glare thing.
I didn't like the in-built speakers at all. The sound quality is too bad. But it comes as a complimentary, so that's ok.
Overall is good. But not too good. I would research more for a better monitor going forward.",3
"overall, its a great purchase.

Pros: good form factor, sleek looking design, the frame around the screen is slim. It has speakers inbuilt, with headphone jacks (audio and mic). colors are nice, brightness and sharpness is nice.
cons: black color for the screen is not a nice black. even with adjustments, the black is slightly like a dark grey. i wouldnt recommend for photo-editing if you are a professional or particular about the quality.",5
"The monitor itself is fine, but the speakers are very weak. We need external speakers and we need to change settings to use those external speakers every time we watch a movie even in a small room.",4
A really good and budget friendly monitor that can be used for office work and gaming/multimedia like OTT. It is very easy to assemble the stand by reading the manual booklet. I've just set it up today and started using it. Will update my review if any problems arise. So far so good.,5
"Great looks, good picture quality with HDMI port, average sound, easy installation. However, though this has two HDMI ports, there was just a serial port cable rather than a HDMI cable.",4
"The display is as advertised. Speakers are a little low on the volume but sound clarity is good.
Removing 1 star because the angle of the screen is fixed and is a little downward. This is irritating as I cannot change the angle..",4
"After 12 days monitor horizontal lines and colour issues, NOT recommending to anyone.",1
"i purchased one Benq monitor couple of weeks ago and This monitor is excellent in quality colors are nice , can be viewed from any angles , over all good monitor ,

i ordered one more monitor for my office but unfortunately amazon delivery team damaged this completely during transit , feel sad ,",5
"Good for casual gaming. The only thing holding it back is the refresh rate in this aspect.
Small text may look harsh because of 1080p but can be solved by lowering the sharpness.
Although you might want to look for a higher resolution if text is important to you. The brightness did not bother me.
Overall, at that price it's a really good deal and it looks good with the small bezels.",5
"This monitor is only good if you require to do basic work like word, excel, emails etc. If you are buying this monitor for watching movies, videos or any heavy graphic work, avoid buying this. I tried extending my MAC book in this monitor to have experience of working on bigger screen, however there is lot of colour variation in comparison.",3
"Best budget monitor for the price.
If you want to game on it, and you are fine with 60Hz you should be good. Otherwise, stretch your budget and get a 144Hz monitor. But for basic browsing and editing it works fine!",5
"I bough this product yesterday, while scrolling down, it blurs, it takes few seconds to get the font, i contacted amazon for return, they did not accept for return only replacement they agreed. i used hp in office it was pretty nice. This is waste.",1
"Very good monitor.
Wall mounting option is also available.
Picture quality is awesome. I use it daily, for last 6 months, the experience is just fantastic.",5
"This product reached the next day morning from the date I ordered. Thanks Amazon for the amazing delivery.

About the picture quality, it is very good. I surely recommend this. But the speaker available in monitor, total waste. You can't even hear the sound properly. So if are planning this for sound, don't buy this.

The anti glare option also good, good to buy.",4
"Have been using this from past 10 months.
Pros:
- Display is great
- Eye care indeed helps
- stand is rock solid
- Bazel is stylist
- Not Made in China",5
"Good design with multiple ports that allow to keep my laptop dock (for my windows laptop) and a minidp cable (for older MacBooks) both connected at all times.

Audio output is decent, but highly recommended to connect an external speaker (monitor has a stereo output jack) if you wish to use this for music, movies or games.

Pixel density is fine (I sit about 1.5 feet away) and overall colours and picture quality is better than the Dell monitors I use at work.",5
"the video quality is good.
the 3.5 mm audio output jack is useful.
the lights in the room do not reflect on the screen.
only the in built speaker is very low in sound output.
had to use 3.5 mm jack and 2.1 speaker system to get proper audible sound .
sole in built speaker is not useful at all.
everything else is just okay and there is not problem with anything else.",4
Every aspect of the monitor is perfect for using as an additional display. Even gaming on the monitor is decent. Only drawback and the reason why Its not 5 star rating is the speaker. 2√ó2w speakers are not so clear and have some audio loss in the mids and low.,4
Really liked the product. Picture quality is great. I use it for my PC as well as PS4 Pro. Worth the price I paid. However i had to replace it twice due to a very small defect. Amazon was kind enough to replace it without any hassle.,5
"Pros:
Good picture quality
Value for money.
Supports both VGA and HDMI (one port).
Comes with HDMI cable for 24 inch monitor.
Good monitor for office work (Programming).

Shortcomings:
No height adjustment (No other brand supports at this price range)
Speaker is not great. Honestly did not expect much, it was evident from spec itself as it's only one watt speaker.",5
"Seems okay so far, visible light bleed is there at right upper corner but its not distracting. Display panel is okay but the height adjustment mechanism is not good as HP models.",4
"Product is just amazing. Finally purchased it with 10% discount @11500 approximately.
You can't get any other brands in this price range with a big 27inch ips led display. HDMI cable is also provided.
It has a premium look with great cable management and optional speaker.

I don't know how many days it will work. But Benq is already well known brand for monitors and projectors.",5
Good for office use (WFH) & Entertainment I am using with dual Arm mount. Didn't used for gaming. And giving 4 star because no HDMI cables provided rest seems good for the investment,4
I had an existing 27 inch monitor from Dell which is around 27000 Rs but decided to add a second monitor to fuel my work from home dreams. This is actually bigger than my existing Dell and is cheaper. I find the picture quality great on day 3 and very good night auto adjustment in night mode. All in all a great buy for the price and hope the product does not diminish in value as time goes by.,4
"I researched a lot to finalize a monitor and I can confidently say that this is one of the best monitors available at its price range. I bought this for 13,000 and I'm completely satisfied with its performance after 4-5 months of usage. It is easy to install and is easy on the keys. Wish there was a function to adjust the height of the monitor (you can adjust the position but not the height).",5
After going through most of the positive reviews i thought product will be good and ordered it. When i got it and tried to operate it the monitor was not working and sent it back for replacement abd the replacement monitor is also having the same. Not happy with thi monitor. There are so many monitors which are better than this. Please do not opt for this produst and get fooled by amazon.,1
"Received well contains hdmi and power cable both. It‚Äôs company condition.
It‚Äôs worth every penny!
It‚Äôs good for those who‚Äôs work from home guys.",4
"The design is very good, sleek and slim. I got the monitor in good packaging and with it i received 1 hdmi cable, 1 monitor power cord, warranty card, instruction manual.

Picture quality is excellent for development work. Has different types of reading mode in built.
Will recommend it to anyone looking for monitor for work. Note: its not a gaming monitor.",5
"I used this monitor for an extended desktop setup, it has built in speakers, which helps me with my conference calls, for the speakers to work you need to use a HDMI cable, the speakers are loud enough. The picture quality is crisp and clear. Happy with the purchase",5

"Large & Crystal display. Already using one of this earlier, bought it again for using double screen.
Eye care feature is really nice and works quite well with adjusting brightness to reduce strain on eyes.
Speekers are just okay. No recommend for music and movies but are okay for office and general sound.
Overall great product. I always prefer benq monitors for my office.",5
"This is my second BenQ after the 2470. Both are working really well. The stand for the 2480 is far more stable than the 2470. I don't game so I cannot comment on refresh rate issues. Colours are fine.

Purchased for 9699 after discount in early October.",5
"Will be great if product distributor/ manufacturer clarity. 15A sockets are normally there in the Kitchen / bathroom for heavy home appliances & geyser.

Heard very +ve feedback about this product, but this power cord is a bummer. hence returning.",1
Perfect delivery and it was sent in good condition just before the lockdown. Was worth it since I needed to work from home. Excellent packing and a really good monitor and works well for my office work.,5
"I'm fan of BenQ, specially this model.
I bought this one for my father.
I also have two 24 inch one of this model for my home laptop & office laptop.
Awesome display quality, you will not regret.",5
Amazing features specially the auto eye care. Couldn't isn't asked for more in 13k. Thank you Benq and And Amazon fire not raising the price during these tough times. I hope I get a good mobile phone as well soon on the Amazon day. Flipkart sale made fool of all customers by raising each mobile phones price by at least 2k,5
"Overall a good monitor. Nice picture quality.
But some cons too.
1. No hdmi cable provided. Disappointed
2. Useless speakers. No volume
3.brightness intelligence isnt working. But im okay
4.its not bezeless. It have some bezzel which you can see after bootup
5. If headphone jack is at frontside..make more sense.
4 out of 5 stars.",4
"First impression is that this is an excellent monitor. It is exactly what I expected. I do coding and the text is crisp. The speakers are good. The price is reasonable, thanks BenQ!",5
"The monitor arrived within 3 days and the build quality is sturdy, the monitor is slim, the blue light filter makes it extremely pleasant for long hours, there is an HDMI cable that the box comes with (and not the VGA cable anymore, although connectivity ports are there for both).",5
I needed larger monitor for my share market business as I could not see clearly due to my age and now I am very happy for having a very good display and I also watch movies on this very closely and nicely,5
"Very crisp display and clarity is good.
In Build speakers are not much use, don't hope that you will use them as a primary speakers.
They works only with DP port and not with HDMI on monitor side.",5
"The picture quality is just average when you connect thro hdmi to your Mac book pro., not much option to adjust the settings., just average but ok for browsing and simple work. Not recommended for accurate colours., photo editing.",3
"Best feature of this monitor is Audio In/Out Port.
Now I don't have to use my laptop's speaker while calling.

Got this for Rs. 8,900 in prime day sale.
It includes HDMI cable too.
Height of monitor with stand is 42cms.",5
"The power socket is big issue, it requires the one used for geysers. The title description says led but it's LCD, bad experience with Amazon. I've decided to quit Amazon shopping after this experience where I could not return.",1
"A class of a product. Has excellent colour reproduction whenever required based on the content.
Ambient sensor works like a charm and intelligently adjusts the screen contrast and color brilliantly.
I was able to get this 24 inch for around 8k which is a steal..üëå.",5
Using this product since work from home started in March 2020. Had got the 27 inch for Rs12900 . It is excellent to use as primary oe secondary to laptop as it comes with hdmi cable included in it. Very much satisfied with the display which is crisp and clear. Well suited to eyes also.,5
"Very nice anti glare monitor with preset display settings. Auto brightness, height adjustment and swivel works like a charm. Very suitble for coding and programming.

Only con: it's made in China :(",5
"I bought 24inch size monitor. Everything is perfect in this product. This product is best under 10000 Rs. Just go for it if you are looking for office work or coding. It's not good for gaming purpose as it's response time is 5ms. I could feel the difference when i played a game. If you are gamer, go for TNL panel monitors. But this monitor is best for Video editing, photoshop, programming and all, except gaming.",5
"I have received my product (GW2480 24-inch IPS monitor) and I am using this since 2 days. So far experience is good.
Cons:
This model does have 2 HDMI port. It has 1 HDMI and 1 display port , 1 VGS (D-Sub) port
Built in audio system is not that great
Pros:
Packaging was good.
Delivered on time.
Picture quality as explained in the product description.

will share more user experience in future.",4
Monitor looks awesome.. It came with 16A power socketüòá. Does not fit into my wall socket..,4
"I bought this for ‚Çπ7999 and it was delivered in 5 days. Really good monitor with great brightness and color accuracy for the price. Had they included HDMI cable in the box, it would have been a perfect package.",4
I spend around 12 to 15 hours a day in front of the screen editing audio and videos... This is so good in terms of the comfort to the eye.. reduces strain by a good extent!,5
"I got a different model. BenQ GW2280-T 19-inch LCD. There was no HDMI cable in the package. The color quality is very bad. Black appears as dark green on screen. The images are not sharp. Only suitable for coding and text based work. Not suitable for image editing , and video editing related work.",2
They have mentioned Vesa wall mount but it is not included in the package. I asked for a replacement thinking it will be there in the new box but no luck. It was missing again. Wrong product description.,1
Don't know who to blame . The product or the Amazon. It's not even a month until I got this. The monitor isn't working anymore.,1
"Biggest drawback - cannot adjust the height and the power cord is a little short.

Everything else is very good - picture quality, no glare, blue filter, brightness adjustment.",3
"Perfect for work from home set-up. Colors look beautiful and no flikering issues observed in 2 weeks that I have it.

Cons:
The inbuilt speaks are useless. External speakers would be a must.",4
When we run any high resolution videos the image starts showing in wierd colors. Had to reduce refresh rate to 50hz on my mac mini to get any meaningful display. The audio output coming from monitor is useless. Overall not very good.,3
"I'm a photographer
I like to buy IPS panel display for colour grading
So I bought this benq
But in the monitor the pictures are amazing
When we see in our mobile
It was quite different
The pictures are dull and low contrast
I changed all settings in picture colour mode but no change
In sometimes on playing a video
Some flicker are coming and 60hz also not working",2
"I bought BENQ24 GW2480.
This monitor is perfect for working and watching movies. It have brightness adjustment setting. We can change those according to our interest. Speakers are actually of no use, so I am plaaning to buy externals.
A little backlight bleeding was there, when I recieved this. But that was not creating much problem for my purposes. Delivery were fast and good. Thank you Amazone.",5
"lots of people saying sound is tooo low , but this is not a TV, only 2 w speakers like laptop
No mic in monitor
But meeting sound can be heard clearly default sound setting it 40 i think you can increase it to 90.
Cons:
Made is China
eye care is not that much useful",3
"Incompatible Plug. We bought these monitor three different times for my office use. Every time the plug comes in different form. The plug can fit only in the bigger socket, not in most of the 5A appliance socket which you find commonly in the households/offices.",1
I was looking for a monitor for couple of months now. My wife suggested me this. I took it and got delivery in 2 days. I am really happy with this product. Coding is smooth. stand is very strong. Picture quality is mind blowing. I will always go for this if given another chance.,5
"There are inscreen dust particles and the display is partially open from the borders. I first thought it was just a protective film, but beware that is the display itself.",1
"Here are a few drawbacks...

1. The inbuilt speaker is not clear/sharp enough for chat use cases...it's muffled. It's kind of disappointing.
2. There are no dedicated buttons for volume adjustment, it takes 2-3 clicks to get to volume adjustment",4
"I have ordered the product for my WFH setup. This monitor has been very easy on the eyes. It's brightness intelligence is wonderful and works pretty well. The sensor sensitivity is configurable.
Overall a very good product at this price.",5
"The product is great.It fullfiled my expectation. I am using this for video editing and best suited me . It's a 27 inch monitor you are seeing in this picture I bought it from Amazon's Great Indian sale
For rupees 11249 with 10 % sbi debit card discount.",5
"if you want to go for a good budget option with 24 inch screen size go for this , in my research i kept some points in my mind which was
1)IPS Display
2)24 Inches
3)thin bezels
definetely this monitor is not perfect because for gaming perspective it is not that good if you have budget gaming pc you can definetely go for this .",5
"Product looks good by design and feels nice by the build it has. And the display is more than awesome for an office use guy, with the preset modes for different uses. And it is not a bad option for multimedia either, as the color/saturation.. and refresh rate is good.",5
"I bought this monitor some time ago and hence, I think that BenQ may have discontinued with this monitor model.

Overall, my experience with this monitor is very good. No harm in investing in this monitor. One of the important feature that the monitor has is to adjust brightness based on ambient light. I find that very handy.",4
"Extremely bezel less.
Accurate colour correction.
No colour shifting when viewed from sides.
No Backlight bleed.
Excellent build quality.
Stand is tough.
Portion for cable management.
No pixel dead issue.

Left monitor is 18.5inch dell, so you can compare the size.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 After delivering the product to me, within 2 days it shows some factual errors on my screen as red dots, it spreads all over my screen and it was really annoying for me. The build quality of this product is above average.",1
"If you're on tight budget this Benq screen vl not disappoint you. Color accuracy, Sharpness is good. 27 in screen just enjoying it. Got delivery before the scheduled time. Thanks seller and Amazon.",5
Please don't buy this product for office work or browsing. The text is not at all clear and amazon doesn't take returns. PLEASE DONT BUY IT,1
"Superb IPS flicker-free picture quality, 92% sRGB colour setting is a good enough for 1920 x 1080 resolution. But better to check out your graphics card and should not be less than 1080 ti. It's good for photo editing and designing. Speaker Sound is not that good but it doesn't matter to me much as I have an external speaker attached with. Came with HDMI and main cables in Indian version so no need to purchase extra anything. Gaming not sure as I don't play.",5
Display is good. Received a defective piece on first delivery. Monitor screen stopped working in a week. But thanks to Amazon as they helped with immediate replacement in a day with new fresh product. The second one is working as expected. 27 inch HD screen is good for eyes.,4
"It has a thick frame around display, and wight is little bit high. Otherwise it is worth to buy at this price
Speaker volume is very low at its max level
No HDMI cable box in the box (Only VGA)
Really easy to install it on table using its manual
Build quality is Good
And finally different modes of color settings are good",5
"Good for the price, excellent picture quality, no bleeding, has a anti glare coating, good for watching movies and for office work, This is not a gaming monitor hence does not have higher refresh rates it can go maximum upto 60hz. My requirements were for video editing and within 10k this is value for money",4
"This is great for the price, I got it for 7,750 INR. The picture quality is great, I had to set rgb to full on ps4 to make the colors right. The inbuilt speakers are terrible, worse than smartphone speakers. The bezeless design is great and it looks even better in person. Gaming on this monitor is great and I haven't had any issues. I wish it was a bit brighter but not a big issue. The monitor is well worth the price..",5
"This monitor is good for switching between two laptops and I liked the speaker facility, Should have provided USB ports along with hdmi so that single keyboard mouse can be used. Overall good monitor.",4
"Images and video are clear. The sharpness seems a bit less. Also the hue is slightly towards yellow (warm) probably due to eye care adjustment. This gives it a dim look in some sceens.
Anti glare property is better than most monitors.",4
quality is good and has two hdmi ports which make it easy plug and play. different eye care modes. like it and affordable compared to other products of this size.,5
"Great picture quality and works well as an extra monitor for your laptop. Haven't tried playing games but works well for office work like working on Excel sheets, PowerPoint and other stuff. Good representation of colors as well",5
"There is not much to complain here, i have been using it for a month. The only thing i care about is the picture quality and for the price its doing a pretty good job. The inbuilt speakers are so low in volume, even lower than my phones speakers. The auto brightness sensor always set the brightness way more than what i need so i turned it off.",5
"After using a week, giving reviews, nice pictures quality, anti-glare, no brightness issues and no strain on eyes after working full day. Really excellent product and must buy without any second thought",5
"Good product but don‚Äôt know why, 15 amp plug is given
The problem with such plug is that when power goes off, monitor also stop working as inverter connection is only in 5 amp supply points
This doesn‚Äôt draw so much of current, this easy change will help a lot",3
I bought this monitor for WFH purpose considering attractive pricing. But its a disappointment with this product. Started giving problems within a month. There is display flickering sometimes and also weird colors during startup. Will not recommend to anyone.,1
"Service by Amazon is good.
Product was working fine for 30 days than suddenly one day it starts blinking continuously.
Have lodged complaint with the BenQ customer care.
Seems quality of lamp is not upto the mark",1
Bought this as a secondary monitor for my work and it has worked quite well. Have been able to get my work done faster and save some time while performing multiple tasks on different screens. Haven't tested for games or movies,5
"In this price range this is one of the best monitor in the market. With speaker and audio jack can be used as TV as well. Although sound is very less but ok.

Picture quality is also good and so far I find it very good monitor with eye care technology.",4
"Good display, picture quality is good for this price range. Brightness settings is the only qualm I have as it's too bright even in the lowest of setting. Hence working on it during night could pose a challenge.",5
"I bought it just seeing the brand, very much satisfied with the quality. I am using two monitors. One can go for it without second thought. I am giving this review just to help the people who are confused of the quality with various brands.",5
"Purchased after covid lockdown for work from home..Nice built and finishing, with inbuilt speakers, many picture quality adjustment options as per your need. Value for money. Not reviewed it for gaming but for office work specially for programing..it displays crisp and clear fonts.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 For this price range this is the best moitor, I am really happy with panel but inbuilt speaker quality is terrible.",4
"I paid Rs.7800 for 24"" IPS. Beat that!
I had previously ordered HP 22m. I had to return it because of a defect in all its models. I was previously using Samsung Syncmaster T220, it gave up after 11 years of usage. It was the first of its kind.
This BenQ monitor seems quite good. This paired with Nvidia display adapter is icks.",5
Very good monitor. Don't know about too many technical details. But eyes and neck don't feel the pain even after long days of work. Adjustable stand and light filters are really good.,5
The monitor is great. Very accurate colours. Do note that the product has a 16 A plug instead of a 6 A plug. I had to get a 16A socket installed in my room because I didn't know this earlier. But not a big deal. It's totally worth it.,4
"Seller deliver me a old mfg. Product. Picture Quality is nice, anti glare function is very nice. But speaker sound makes disappointed. Very low sound output. Actually I purchased it because its having HDMI and inbuilt speaker. Don't buy this product if you searching for good quality of inbuilt speaker sound.",3
Overall the monitor is good. No stress on eye for long work. Gaming is also good. Speaker are very disappointing. No pratical use. Option for 2 inputs is of great use.,3
Did a lot of research and bought this. Monitor is very good and cable management is also very useful. IN built speaker might not be great for can be used during night and for the price I really wont complain. Value for money monitor from Benq.,5
"Good monitor for the price. The reason I got this is IPS, HDMI, and built-in Speakers. Was skeptical about speakers but they sound good for kids online classes or audio conf...sound quality is acceptable, clean with no distortion.",5
power chord is too big and does not fit .. moreover one silver thin rod inside the support panel which is used to hold the wires in is missing. There is only one while pictures show 2 .. very shady .. will see how to get this started once I find a way to plug the power chord,1
This is good monitor for office purposes. This monitor is good value for your money. The stand and power cord and HDMI cable are good in quality. The picture quality is also good for day today office work. This monitor has built in speakers. It is additional.,5
"A good monitor, but not expect enything from ""the intelligent brightness"" thing, it has 2 levels i think, and those 2 levels have no much difference.
And sound, consider it doesn't have a speaker. If your looking for a monitor with this 2 in mind dont go for this,
Otherwise its good moniter.",4
"The monitor is good for office use but not good for HD media consumption, the contrast ratio is really bad. After all I received the first monitor the screen partially went black and replaced it buthe replacement monitor also had dead pixels so returned it for a refund",3
"Wonderful device
-works with fire stick
-works with mi box
-works with dth box
Just need to plug HDMI cable... that's all
And you can obviously use it as monitor... üòÅ speakers are not much loud...but it's only 8-9K...amazing",5
"The Monitor is really good and worth buying. Haven't had any bad experince yet, bezel free screen lets you view edge to edge. Color production is good and picture quality is good. It's an anti-glare screen, that helps in reducing eye strain.
Anyone with limited budget can definitely opt for this.",4
"Doesn't work best over vga, please use HDMI.
Eye comfort drastically alters the colours, would not leave it on all the times.
Apart from that, looks good, picture quality is awesome for the price.
Has speakers just for the sake of having, anyways that shouldn't make a difference.
picture quality 5/5
design 5/5
Eye comfort 3/5
Speakers 1/5",4
"I bought this monitor for my laptop - work from home purpose. my main usage is for office work, browsing & watch movies rarely. I am satisfied with the product.
Brightness : Good
color production : OK
one drawback is, power cord is not fitting properly, because of that sometimes it switches off.",4
"1) Power cord of power cable supplied is not standard size. Its 16A large one that comes with microwave oven. Need to buy adaptor or standard power cable separately. So yet not tested.
2) No hdmi cable in the box
So disappointed.",4
I bought this monitor to have as my second monitor. It works fine as expected without any issues. Only problem I faced was that the monitor power adapter comes with the big plug size which is used for AC's and such. Had to order another normal sized power cable because of that.,4
"The picture quality is perfect, you get the full 1080p resolution and the images appear crisp.

Brightness is very good, and while it‚Äôs not enough to combat the brightness from a window, the matte finish does help.

Gaming isn‚Äôt a big let down, but the frame drops are apparent when traveling at high speeds and ghosting is visible. However, it does work very well with consoles such as PS4s.",4
A very good HD display with eye care technology which helps reduce eye stress. Would have been a perfect display with additional hdmi or a usb connector.,4
"Really nice product....after 1 month using
Very impressive thin bezels and I love it..

Besides, best for gaming and editing
Overall I feeling good performance",4
"Worth it. It didn't mention that the screen is LCD with LED backlighting. This is quite an easy steal for its worth. Helping a lot with my digital painting work and gaming is good as well. Not sure about multiplayer though. If you're looking for cheap options, this monitor is a best buy.",5
Worst product... color is bleeding from all corners. Small dots of display crack are present of bellow left corners.,1
"If you are expecting a good quality display with speakers. then you are wrong
Bad picture quality....
Buy LG 22'' Display instead of it...",1
"Its really worth the money, bezel-less display makes the feel of its being so big, awesome for eyes with adaptive mode. nice for office use and daily purposes.
Speakers are so low by volume, since it was not my main expectation i dont care much on it, picture wise, its really a great one with color and good resolution.",5
"Manufacturing companies are just compromising about quality. they need to check, but they didn't check well. I got gap on left. It's A Pure Gap. But Quality is amazing. 60Fps gaming, Only you can enjoy 1080p. It's LED Backlit Screen.",1
Good product. Value for money. The stand is tiltable. But you can't increase the height. But in this price range it's not a big deal. Overall good,5
It's not the one for gaming Unless you are having a massive upgrade. It's a bit too faded for antiglare and colour calibration is your headache now. It's ergo is nice and in all its a sleek monitor with its looks. I got it in quarantine and it's been nice till now.,3
"I know BenQ was one of the good monitors from long time, but recently purchased this monitor and it is a worth for the money i spent. Picture Quality is Great compared to my laptop and old monitor. It's auto brightness feature is Cool. Overall i recommend this monitor though price is normal compared to the features it has.",5
"Hi, I bought this monitor and within month I am getting screen flickering. This was really not expected.
Please let me know whom I can contact.",2
"It's really looks and feels fabulous, Very Slim and yet bezeless with a affordable decent price for 27"" inch monitor. Easy to set-up the monitor with predefined and custom settings..!! Very comfortable to use and great. Thanks to Amazon and Benq.!",5
"Color looks pretty accurate, close to my MacBook display which was a priority for me. Thin and uniform bezels look great, and the black color gives it more of a minimal look. Anti-Glare coating is nice to have.
I am not much of a gamer so can't comment on it.",5
"Excellent Product!

The Product Comes With VGA Cable ,(It did for me)
Has very nice colours and sharpened images with low bezel ...

The stand is a little aggressive looking and is solid metal ..

If youre on a budget then go for it ..... Delivery was really good with product in Great condition and no damage ...",5
"The best in this budget
Stunning look, especially while it's turned on. Thanks for the bazel less design
Good features like auto brightness adjust and low blue light settings",5
"Volume is very low. Firstly received defective item, the screen hot vertical purple line 4 daya after the use. It got replaced and now using the new monitor. Haven't faced any issue yet.",3
"bad picture quality. Auto bright ness adjustment is not working.By default brightness and contrast is very high and looks too much white. Very high brightness for very low brightness settings too, which is straining my eyes.",1
Inbuilt speaker not working. Not to reach expected range,3
"The warranty is not 39 months as mentioned , it's 36 months from date of manufacture or bill whichever is earlier.
The day I purchased this , I got a 1 year old product with , so effective warranty I got is only 24 months with no fault of customer. This is tricky and not fair .

1 star to Seller for this",3
Recieved in one day ...quick deliver by Amazon. Monitor is thin and good picture quality. Met my expectations. The one thing i don't like is the built in speaker sound is very very low... But it has the audio jack where we can attach external speakers if we want. Design and finishing is great. Overall I like this monitor... I thing best in price..,4
"A big blue color spot is there on screen clearly visible on white background
Now a days most of the things comes defective from amazon after spending that much money. REALLY BAD",1
"I‚Äôm Using this monitor since 10 months. Brilliant anti-glare display, no eye strain, beautiful design. Well packed and safely delivered.. üëçüèª",5
"With in one month i had faced problem with monitor display... i want to exchange but return policy is with in 10days only .. After one month i had faced what todo? amazon CC not taking calls.. it had 1year warranty, but new monitor with in one month it is going to servicing center a great piece.. in this COVID situation we r facing this type of problems also...",2
Totally useful for office work. I am using it as a display monitor and connects seamlessly. Very effective and good on eyes. I like the clutter free wiring feature on the back as well. Good purchase !!,4
I bought this for graphic design purpose. I regret buying it. The color balance is bad. It‚Äôs near to impossible to calibrate it correctly. Min brightness is too high to use in dark environment.,2
"Within a few months, a large area in the top left suffered LCD damage, perhaps due to a slight impact. But there is no crack or physical damage on the monitor. When I contacted Benq service, they refused to repair the monitor under warranty. It is clear that the LCD damage occured due to poor quality of the monitor. So do not buy this monitor",1
"I received a faulty product at first. It had a issue with pixelation on screen with edges uneven and rough. The issue was reported with Amazon technical team and they agreeed to replace the product.

The replacement is good and quite happy for the price paid.

Thanks Amazon tech team for the prompt response.",3
"It's an awesome monitor at this price.. I brought a benq LCD monitor back in 2007 and it worked well for me and I guess it still works (as it was given to a friend of mine).. and so thought to go for for Benq again and really liking it. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and to Benq for another good product.
Cheers,
Cherry Thomas",5
"* Packaging was unprofessional. It looked like it was repacked by a previous purchaser while returning it.
* The monitor itself was not in a working condition.
* All accessories were also unprofessionally packed. It was clearly not a brand-new factory sealed piece.

Have asked for a refund or exchange.",1
"After a weeks usage I'm writing this review. This monitor is good at this price range. I use this primarily for writing code and satisfies my requirement. Picture quality is good and of course not a bad option for watching movies while taking a break.
Coming to the anti-glare property it's on the top notch and won't give too much strain for your eyes.",4
"As mentioned by everyone else, without second thoughts this monitor can be bought. Perfect for sweet spot 24 inch lovers. Awesome picture quality for gaming, reading, movies etc. You won't even notice the bezel when the monitor is switched on. Premium look",5
"I procured this for my work from home purpose, too good. Perfect screen, proper brightness, precise picture and text quality also contemporary. Comparing to other, just got for it without second thought.",5
"Never used an Monitor always used laptops , although i know there are many others monitors this is a good monitor for beginners who would use it for normal work or reading . There will be little stuck pixels here and there but i have seen in any displays these days . A good monitor for normal use .",4
I had seen high reviews and purchased it . Looks and brightness all is good.. but it has a spark on backside. I have to remove plug as even in power off state I get spark daily. Also screen gets blinked at times.. better to go with dell.,1
"Been using it for a while now as a secondary monitor to my Laptop. It's large and very useful for programming.
Perfect for the work from home setup.

Don't count on speakers, they are not even worth a mention.",5
Very good monitor for daily use and normal game perspective. Deleivered on time eventhough it was mot in Amazon box but from the company packing directly. One VGA cable is provided with this.,5

 I just received this product and seems good. But when I connect this to my all-in-one PC I am not getting proper display but can see mouse pointer on a blue screen. I could connect and work with my MI TV without any issues. Can anyone help?? Will wait for some time.",5
"The cheapest budget 27inch monitor the bezels are very thin, thanks for the matte finish BenQ üëç,if you are looking for 27inch 1080p monitor at low price u can go for this trust worthy and the light sensor is also working at the best.",5
"I bought this monitor for online classes of my kid and I think with proper settings (e.g., brightness setting to reading level) it works very well and puts no strain on eyes.",5
I have been using 2 of these monitors and they both are wonderful! Display quality and value for money,5
This monitor is very good according to the price. Picture quality is also very good but not for designers. Only 2 problems I found. There is screen bleeding issue and 60hz refresh rate.,3
"Excellent product. Go for it. The auto brightness is too bright for me so i had to turn it off and keep the brightness customized. All in all, a very solif product.",5
"When I tried to unplug or plug cables backside while power is on, I got electric shock, thank god, I didn't drop it that time. Experiencing the same shock another side of the HDMI cable also while connecting it to my laptop. Coming to picture quality, very good product at this price. My only concern is the electric shock.",2
"Got it for 8100/- INR during Great Indian sale.
It's worth the price and good quality.
Display quality and colors are good but speakers are useless..",4
"Its very good for working long hours. Good picture quality and colors.
For gaming, there is no support for Adaptive Sync and thus causes screen-tearing on low frame rates.",5
"pros:
the blacks are nice after some tweaking some settings in the monitor.
the bezel is almost edge to edge.
good picture quality
overall a good buy for 8500
cons:
the lowest brightness could be less especially for programmers like me.
the stand is kinda wobbly and it shakes when i type fast but thats cuz of my table also to some extend.
the response time is slow.",4
"Nice value for money
No bleeding
Best if working for long office time
24 inch curved samsung I have purchase as second monitor then I felt samsung curved is better",5
"I had the information about the goodwill of benq monitors long time ago as one of my friends bought it several years ago he recommended me so I purchased it without any second thought. I really loved the display quality, brightness and this amazing feature called eye care, which is basically auto brightness... I don't have any problems about this product expect one thing, it's orientation.",5
"A good buy for the price, but do keep in mind that the display is not ultra sharp, and you will notice this especially if you are coming from a QHD or higher resolution display. There is no height adjust, we can only change the tilt angle.",4
"It is an amazing monitor at this price point.. It has auto brightness feature which works great, but the thing it lacks is it does not have standard (type D) indian power adapter... It has a type M South African Power adapter... Luckily I had a Type M power Socket.. But please provide Type D power Adapter",4
"I am not a game lover, I am using it for Coding for my daily job and pretty happy with the quality.

Only limitation is not able to tilt the monitor. I was height adjustment is not available but nothing mentioned about tilting too. Deducting one star for that.",4
"I am using this monitor for almost a month now for office use. It is serving the purpose pretty decent.
The adaptive brightness is responding good to room light changes.",4
Very dissatisfied after unboxing and using benq monitor I found a red pixel in screen which is very disappointing Amazon,1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 This monitor is intolerant to even slight fluctuations in power supply ( micro seconds ). I have 2 monitors. This one blinks but HP one does not. See the attached video. Everything else is great.",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 After 3 months of use I am seeing two bleeding lines on monitor. I am not a heavy user of monitor. And I only clean the screen with dry cloth. This is a manufacturing defect in the piece. If this same problem is seen by anyone else then please do not buy benq product. Better go for Dell",2
"Good 27 inch monitor ..sleek and does it work.

Good for designers and movie binge watchers. But I suggest 24 inch is the best for IT people. as you sit close to the monitor...",5
"1) Good price point
2) no issues at all
3) Audio quality is good enough for taking office calls. Just like the laptop speaker.
4) No comments on the gaming, I don't play games, so did not test.",5
"With thin bezels and crisp display, this monitor is absolutely worth the price. I got it on sale at 9k. It is extremely easy to install and I got it connected to my laptop and running in no time. The feature I love most is the panel in the stand that allows you to conceal the cables very neatly by routing them through a port at the base of the stand. The build quality is impressive.",5
Its good monitor with low budget. But the product title says 21.5 inch. but product description says dimension is 48.9 x 18.3 x 39.2 cm. So highest length 48.9 cm = 19.25197 inch. So WHY THE PRODUCT TITLE SAYS it is 21.5 inch?,4
"I bought this for editing purposes. The panel got damaged within two months of usage. Warranty is not applicable for panel damage. When I contacted their support team they mentioned a cost of 9790+18% GST. Actually, I bought this for 13990 in debit card EMI. So you can buy this product if you can afford another 9790+18%GST for panel repair.",2
"Purchased for work reasons. Value for money. Gets the job done. The inbuilt speakers are quite weak, woule have appreciated it if they were stronger..",5
"A perfect non gaming monitor! Just Go for It.

Design: 5/5
Picture Quality + Colour: 5/5
Speaker: 3/5 (but having them is a HUGE convenience!!!)
Value filor money: 5/5

It's a right balance of everything.",5
"I have been using for few months now mainly for office work. Not much of any issue, picture quality is good and its not harsh on eyes.",4
"Worst experience ever
I‚Äôve got a defective piece of benq monitor on 15 sept and I requested for a return on that day only ... since then There hasn‚Äôt been any agent here to pickup the monitor ; it‚Äôs more than 10 days and soon the return window is going to be closed !!!",1
This is just perfect. Go for it. It looks like TV screen and make my weekend. This is also great for office use. Using that big screen for working is another level fun.,5
Very good monitor for the price. I am completely satisfied with this purchase. Picture quality is very good. Cherry on top is the inbuilt speakers.,5
"Picture quality is good. Liked the mat finish. Just not happy with the adaptive brightness feature, not sure if it working responsively.",4
"I use this fir my wfh setup. Speakers louder than laptop tweeters, but don't expect much. Anti-glare, eye care features works well.
Good value for money. No complaints after 2 months usage. Go for it.

I got it for 9k.",5
I was searching from many days and spent so many hours to find best one for me under my budget and finaly bought and Used BENQ gw2780. After using from. 2 days i can confidently say that who All are looking monitor for WFH and entertainment ..they can buy without second thought and 101% You will Not regret.,5
I'm a photographer (Instagram: @anik.sau) and purchased this monitor for photo processing. It's an amazing monitor for photo editing. The colour are and the brightness are optimum for professional photo retouching. Totally loved the monitor.,5
Your laptop built in speakers are louder than volume level 100 on this monitor. Both HDMI and VGA/3.5 mm inputs fail to provide decent volume level on the sound. This monitor can be bought if you want to ignore it's built in speaker capability.,1
"I really liked the product, monitor has a very good display.
Inbuilt speakers are good, clearly audible from around 1-2 meters distance from the monitor.
Headphones out is really a cool feature as you can connect to external audio system.
I still really didn't try any gaming yet.",5
"Go for it, all features working fine. Even on VGA also getting good display.Best display in its range. Height adjustment is not there. Builtin Speakers I never use. Less blue light mode is good. HDMI cable provided.",5
"I use this monitor for Photo Editing & its very best for the photo editing in this monitor colours are looking very sharp & accurate.
Best monitor I ever use. Buy this monitor without any doubt",5
"i did not expected this big is 27"" but its Awsome to watch movie and youtube and also good for browsing
just make sure that you know the size before buying
talking about monitor its nice and bright if you increase the brigtness
}2 negatives that
*Moniotor output 3.5mm jack is not as good as direct to PC
*Swiching the settings in monitor is so difficult to press button and navigate",5
I bought this for my dad for his daily work. The display quality is awesome and it was easy to set up. And delivery was quick.,5
"I bought this for two reasons - 1. Viewing 2. Inbuild speakers .
For Viewing I give it 5 stars
For audio / speaker quality I give it 1 star.
So if you want to buy it just for monitor purpose, then you can go for it.",4
"Really excellent monitor.
Super quality and auto brightness is working perfect.
This is the best monitor in this price range with this excellent feature's",5
When I receive item the box is open even I called Amazon and they told me to send pics to email but email was not working. Today after 20 days screen is flickers while I use HDMI 2 port and works fine on HDMI 1 port . It is really worst ever purchase from Amazon India and none here to help.,1
"I bought this Monitor in Feb 2021 and stopped working on 14th May 2021. I lodged complaint regarding it but no support or any kind of assistance provided by Benq team. So customer support is not at all good.

RMA # R210501197",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I got this today (4 Oct) early delivery thump up for that after using it 2-3 hr it's display got damage itself as shown in the photo and video. I booked it for return let see.",3
"Well BenQ has really a Excellent Brand. The Gw2780 has more than others offers and quality feels how premium it's this.
Yiu don't believe Gw2780 build quality is so hard. The boys who delivered benq will offered me very poor delivery. In fornt of ne they drop the led from bike. And my impression is shocking well i check properly the product and then paid. So that's why benq is more than a price segment product.",4
I picked this up cos of a recommendation from a friend. I'm very pleased with the auto-brightness and other display options. Very less strain on the eyes and the monitor is of the right size. I think any size smaller than this would not be great.,5
This is China Made,2
"Overall product is good, good colour production and good response and lookwise fresh and elegant . Only drawback is compNy doesnt provide HDMI cable with it and it is made in China even though it is Taiwanese company.",5
Very good product...Picture quality and the response time is awesome. ...Inbuilt speakers are not up to the mark but that's not really need as we have an option for audio out ...So home theatre can be connected via aux. Am using it to connect amazon stick too and it works well,5
"I have ordered 24"" height adjustable GW2480T model, but on delivery i have got the defective product. The screen was dim on one side. I have returned the product immediately.
Also the screen was not as sharp as i expected it to be.",1
"I am using this for productivity . As the screen is big I can do multiple tasks at the same time . I haven't faced any issues yet .
Quite easy to set up.
And delivery was also timely and we'll packed.",5
I purchased this monitor since I had to work from home during pandemic. I am fully satisfied with the performance and display quality provided by Benq in a very reasonable price. For an IT professional it is the best thing for daily work related task. I am not fond of gaming so no comments on that.,5
"Hi,

Overall performance of this monitor is fantastic If I would compare with other Brands Its suitable for those who is working hours long in front of the system and Its clarity and brightness is far better than other monitors. Its a good product and delivered to me on time by amazon delivery partners.",5
"Fantastic monitor. Everything seema to work as description of the product, with only drawback of sound, it is very low and not good quality.",4
"I purchased this for my WFH purpose actually it's does job well... no lag than while connecting. there seems to be an single pixel failure when trun on but it disaprears upon using it.

I was expected good audio but audio is not up to the mark",4
"I was used to my Dell 27 inch earlier and felt thats a bit better to this but this has the reading light effect and blue light filter so can compensate a it there ... rest value for money, close your eyes and buy if budget is concern.",4
I have purchased this for my daughter to attend online classes. She is very happy with this monitor and in fact this helped her focus more on her studies as it created lot of value in reading web materials and clear online class notes etc. Must have for students attending online class with laptops.,5
"I am an architect not a game savvy, the monitor comes with excellent quality and clarity, I recommend it have it. Essay to plugin.",5
Good product. It would better to optimise the auto brightness control. Sometimes the auto adjustment create pain in eyes.,5
Good number of ports compare to competition. I built speakers are advantage. Price and quality is great for home user. Dell ultra sharp may be better but they are at least double the price.,5
"The packaging was amazing. The delivery was fast and the product is good. Had a Hp screen for 10years. Not trying Benq for the 1st time though, have used the smaller screen of benq for business purposes before. But this eye care one has amazed me. I feel like my eyes are happier now.",5
This is the one of the best monitor. Best part is it has inbuilt speakers and 2 HDMI port. More you can watch on my YouTube channel DIY Tech Talk.,5
Very sturdy and good picture quality. I am using it with my laptop and very comfortable as compared to working on laptop screen.,5
Worth the price and great picture quality. Decent PPI density as it's a 22 inch screen. I'm using it for content creation and gaming. The panel has decent colour reproduction and refresh rate.,5
"Monitor is good for office work, as its anti glare screen seems so soothing for eyes. Bezel is slim and thin. Overall happy with product.",5
"Product received in good condition, no physical damage. Unable to check the monitor working condition due to Accessories send wrongly. Provided Power cord 16A instead of correct one , so unable to plug in the junction box /Plug point due to head size bigger. And also not advice able to use the high Amp cable for monitor.",1
"Good quality... very rich elegant look. Excelent performance. Absolute no flicker in any applications , game or mac or laptop. My LG monitor had flickers in some applications and screens. Worth the price",5
Costwise its bit costlier because of stand otherwise GW2780 and GW2780T features have same picture quality.not able move monitor side ways asked for replacement.But Samsung( curved) is best monitor when compared to benq in this Price range.,3
I'm a gamer and content creator & I've been using this monitor for months it's great. I had a long research before buying it. It's an ideal product for video or photo editing and gaming too.. but for gaming it's not perfect but it works out. New gamers and moderate gamers out there can get it no regret. Best monitor on its price range. Yea boiiiiiiiiüòú,4
"I got defective product and i requested for return and return pickup not happening, they are not taking action, worst Amazon service... It have been 25 days , please don't waste your money...",1
I'm using it for 2 weeks now!! It's working great till now!! The picture quality is awesome!! Though I gotta do some more checks!!,5
This product is good for watching your favorite movies but certainly not for the serious gamer. Inbuilt speakers do not produce that much sound. You can hear up to 1.5 meters (I give 2 star for (speakers).,4
I'm using it since last 25 days. I bought it for my brother at INR 7999 AI. Its worth it. It looks chic & view is sharp. Till now its worth it.,5
Amazon is not taking responsibility nor connecting me to the supplier. This is un acceptable and I will pursue all options to get a replacement or refund,1
"Pretty Good And a Bang for the Buck. Delivery Was Neat and packaging was good .... The installation was super easy .....I tested it with a bleeding test with RGB And Black Color and found not a single grain of Bleed...

(Note : The connector doesn't have a normal size )",5
"The product is very good, especially the price was just right for me.
I was planning to set up a small home office during this COVID situation and it was perfect. Suited my budget.
Not sure about the gaming etc., but decent enough for office work, reading, watching movies at times.",5
"Bouth 24 inch one
Speaker is useless otherwise it's a good monitor.
Speaker is too low for even a person sitting nn front of the monitor. So it's totally useless.
Resolution is fine.
Instead of speaker they couly have provided nusb ports, that could have added more value in less cost.",4
Best to use as TV and Computer. I have connected MiNox 4k. its awesome.. Sound little slow but u can use a woofer box to make ir dolby,5
"Nice product. Been using since 10 days, and happy with performance. Do note that the default setting might need to be modified to suite your viewing needs. I use it for my office work.",5
"Though I have used dell 21 inch monitor earlier,this 24 inch monitor is fantastic. I thought of purchasing 27 for my daily development work but this is the perfect one for coding. No glare, easy to install. Though it's just 2 hours, I'm very very happy with this product. Thank you Amazon.",5
"Was. Bit wotried as earlier experience ... Buying computer accessories was not good
But this purchase was good .. single day delivery ..
Good quality
Speakers are just manageble ..",4
"Worth buying slim and perfect.
Eye care technology I loved it and really it works.
Hats off Benq for its perfect packing.
I bought height adjustment monitor, even kids can also easily adjust the height nice technology.
Thanks Amazon for such a good product",5
This is really good to back light leak and very good screen for office work purpose. The only thing bothers me is the volume. Rest all is very good,5
"first of all i am really happy with the delivery speed of amazon even during the lockdown, got this delivered within 3days. i required this led basically for photo editing and within my budget this was the perfect choice . brilliant colors and amazing response time even at 70mhz",5
"Donot buy if you wish to play games and watch movies with inbuilt speakers and display has a huge backlight bleeding issues at the most.
All the above looks correct once you have it for yourself.",3
"I bought this product because, their advertisement is, ""Dual HDMI and in-Built Speakers"", but it has no built in speakers. The monitor is nice, good looking. It have 2 HDMI ports also. But company provide only vga cable.",4
Not at all recommended with in 20 days started blinking,1
Super monitor with affordable price . great seller: Appario Retail Private Ltd . we can trust this seller. mostly iam buying from this seller only.,5
"The monitor works really good for this range. The only reason i gave a 4 star is because since its a HDMI monitor, I was expecting to get a HDMI cable, but I received a VGA cable. Couldn't find a logic in it, other then the seller trying to cut down their cost..",4
"Ticks all the boxes, has great picture quality. Colors are good to read and do programming stuff. Have been playing Forza on it, looks great. Borders are minimal and high resolution videos looks crisp. You can go for it if you are confused like I was.",5
"This is best 24 inch monitor in this price ..I bought this ‚Çπ7600 in Great Indian festival offer..one week of usages... it's just owesom..
Cons: if you are using this in night don't enable sensor, you have to adjust brightness and contrast till 24% and that is manageable.
just go for it...",4
"Very Good Product With Latest Technologies amazing experience with Eye care technologies
Very good sharpness & clarity amazing i inserted some photo which is very useful for see to original one",5
"This monitor is best for photo editing and seeing movies in any angle sitting down,up and bottam aand any and any work is suitable And price is also good.
This product is value for money. Etc
If any one want to buy monitor for any work simply go to this monitor and select and buy simply.",4
Worth for this Price range...Ambient light sensor works perfect..Superb viewing angle..Colour reproduction is good for this Price...Inbuilt Speaker is too low u have to use external speaker for better sound...I would recommend this monitor for day to day use...,5
Monitor is very good in terms of picture quality and anti-glare. But came with a 16A plug which doesn't match normal 3 pin socket. Had to buy another chord for this. Company should have provided the normal chord.,5
Second monitor is always good to increase the productivity specially when you work in IT industry. This monitor solves it purpose and I am happy with it.,5
"Well built device. Easy on your eyes if you spend long hours in front. No eye strain compared to some well known brands (could be a specific models). If you are wondering what's under BENQ branding label, it is eye-care sensor.",5
"Just buy without thinking if your budget under 12K.
Pros:
1.Top notch display
2.Sturdy stand
3.Good viewing angles
4.Best for WFH and text is very crisp.
5.Good ergonomics

Cons:
1.Speaker
2.Very heavy
3.Not for hard core gaming",5
"device screen is very week to handle any small pressure which will result to LCD damage rom internally without any damage mark outside. which will cost buy new LCD again.

even snesor is uslsess very less accuracy have. buy HP or dell branded LCD which log lasting.",1
"Very thin bezels.
warm white color.
automatic brightness adjustment based on room light intensity is a great feature to have.

In built speakers volume is average., similar to laptop speakers.",5
"Excellent purchase.. Best Buy for home-office setup. You can watch movies as well without any issues.
For high end graphics game, not recommended.
I‚Äôm happy.",4
Product is just fine for gaming but my monitor has a very low volume of its own...... don‚Äôt know if this is a feature for all gaming monitors.....?,3
Good picture quality & anti glare and poor sound quality,3
"Good quality product.
Only bads:
1. Return or replacement not possible for any higher model.
2. No HDMI cable included only VGA
3. Connectivity via vga is not working so not sure if my laptop accessory vga port is faulty or monitor vga or vga cable.",5
The poc quality is excellent with accurate color reproduction and brightness levels. Soothing for our eyes. Got it during the summer sales for a discounted price. A good purchase,5
"Value for money if you compare other LED monitors from well known brands such as Dell, LG or Lenovo. I am using it for work from home and connected my laptop it to have an extra workspace",5
Good product and past one week observed that won't feel any affects to eyes while using continues hours of hours when comparing with my Laptop Screen..,5
"Good product
Good for gaming
Good for editing
I love this monitor it is so premium look
Great value",5
"The top left corner has a slight leak. Sound not that great but I did not buy it for sound anyways. As just a display monitor for regular work/reading, it does the job very well. 24 inch is a very good fit on a work table. Has enough buttons to adjust brightness and colour according to needs.",5
"Benq rules the professional series of minitors. Though in India it is not popular but designers world over prefer this over any other minitor. Interestingly samsung, Lg etc are considered actual monitor makers.",5
"I bought three of this monitors, and its perfect for my work, good quality picture ... I just love it.
You wont regret it you buy this at this price range.
Just buy it :)",5
"I love the nearly bezels less screen. The low blue light works well.
However I just have one complaint regarding this, they haven't given any custom button for volume up and down, you need to go inside the full menu to do that.
rest all is great.",5
"It is a complete package. Bought it to work from home, got recommendation from a friend who preferred this over Dell. Picture quality is good, has multiple connection ports, even comes with built in speakers.",5
"Recieved one week before expected delivery date, thank you for Amazon for fast delivery on this lock down time
The item is best in this budget of 9500
Value for money, benq coming with high picture quality without flicker
A little blacklight bleeding in the corner that doesn't effect the display quality",4
"Excellent budget monitor for everything.
The thin bezels make is really good for multi monitor gaming.",5
"Works better for me so far. Awesome and sleek product especially with three ports display port,hdmi and vga.

But only con is the speaker output is very low and u can't use that for anything. Needed a seperate speaker unit.",4
We received a defective piece. The screen is continously flickering and there are yellow. Never buy this. We replaced the defective item and recieved a new one. It was working fine for 15 days and now it is flickering again. Do not buy this product. I would give give this product below 1star.,1
The sound quality is very poor..with a 27 inch screen.. one sits a bit away.. however I have to use external speakers to listen..the in built speakers are very poor.. very low sound in spite of keeping at max level,4
Bought this during 2020 lockdown. Picture quality and anti glare are wonderful. Definitely we may not able to compare with all high pricing monitors. Wonderful product in this price range...,5
"Awesome monitor with adjustable capabilities makes easy to adjust as per convenient.l, less stress on eyes",5
"Excellent product but it does not have HDMI cable only D-Sub(VGA) cable is delivered. Guys in some comments You will find HDMI included, but that's not correct I have replaced one based on the comments but found no HDMI cable delivered with this model",5
"Value for money.. Please Make in India!!!
Full of features. Height adjustment is not available, but great to buy for the price.
24"" looks sufficient for the development/coding work.
In-built speaker is also good for the money.",5
"At this price range, this is a brilliant product. Although i won't really say that this is the best monitor for gaming, but it does a good job. This monitor would be more suitable for regular office work as it has a comfortable viewing experience for longer usages, and that's also my primary usage",4
"Very good monitor for office work and has PPI is on lower side, movie and picture quality are on the lesser side of the sharpness.",4
"Picture quality is excellent with 1080p‚Äîno HDMI cable inside the box, just a VGA. The in-built speaker is good for nothing. Just ignore and add external speakers. The refresh rate is 60hz.",5
This is a good product.. but unfortunately I am not sure after 2 months of buying there is white line at top corner of the monitor and suddenly it will disappear and again it will come...,4
"Good product, prompt delivery, super easy to install. very easy and intuitive operations. Took 2 min to set it up without even looking at the instruction manual and 3 more minute to place on table and connect to the main system.",4
"Been using for 5 days, it's amazing. Thin, lightweight, and has very small bezels. Got this for 9K.

I am using it for everyday office work and is great",5
Best in Budget but i have problem with this monitor of auto brightness it does not work on my one so before use it check it...,5
Using it from past two months. Good monitor in this price range. IPS panel is not is not up to the mark when compared to Dell. Also this monitor is not good for reader's.,4
The picture quality of this monitor is very very very good I cannot explain it in words I am using a v a panel and IPS panel you can spot the difference between those two in my pictures,5
"Great monitor, but the inbuilt speakers are useless...you cant really hear anything. They should save money and remove these speakers.

As much as the monitor alone is concerned. Amazing performance and crisp display. !00% worth the money",5
a thin horizontal line is appearing on the screen. product is quite good but i highly disappointed by quality check pricess of benq and replacement policy. we always expect qc passed product should reached to us but benq failed in this department.,2
"I purchased this screen after watching a video on YouTube for use in software development.
It amazing for me, very attractive and safe for eyes, just go for it",5
I had one and ordered one more as I needed it for my kid. First one was good. Second one came with a 16 Amp plug. It does not for into any socket now. Need to buy a separate power chord,3
Very good display good colors if not the best.Only problem is that it takes a few seconds to Show display,4
"Except for speakers everything is good at this price point. Not recommended for those who purchase a monitor with speakers. Even if you turn up the volume to 100, the output is only 1 volume.",3
Crisp video. Sharpness and contrast is nice. Color creation could have been better. Good for normal photo and video editing but not so for gaming. Audio is pretty average. Ergonomic design and build quality is fine. Controlls are well defined but have no toggle switch. No true HDR though picture quality is fairly appreciable.,4
"I brought this as a replacement for LG gaming monitor at same price segment. Seems this sufficed me in all aspects. Only disappointing fact is this is not LED monitor, it's backlight LED with LCD. So rating as 4. Other than, its good in all aspects. Great buy at this price. Thanks to amazon.",4
Simply awesome monitor. You can gor for it without any second thought. Only thing I was little bit disappointed was sound quality coming from monitor. Company can add more powerful speaker to make it a perfect monitor in this segment.,5
"Over all good product for a daily 9-5 or 10hr of office job. As I a programmer, this product is a good fit for my needs. It is neither too big nor too small. Perfect for a home office setup.",5
Picture is flickering and screen goes blank for some time.. This was purchased only 3 weeks ago and it's obvious that Amazon has sold me a defective monitor.. please refund my money or replace the monitor,1
"Please at least provide a hdmi cable with it.
AND THE POWER CABLE IS LOOSE IT GETS OFF AGAIN AND AGAIN
PLEASE THE POWER SOCKET CONNECTED TO THEE MONITOR
ELSE THE BUILD QUALITY AND PICTURE IS VERY NICE , GOOD PRODUCT.. it will be much more helpfull
Thankyou",5
"Good product
The screen goes off for a second if you switch on other appliances in the house",3
Does the job. Monitor is sturdy and feels like it is of good quality. Image quality is good. Audio works ok.,5
"I use as an auxiliary display for my MacBook Pro. The big, bright screen really is easy on the eyes.",5
"No complaints about quality of monitor. But there a few things to consider before buying this -
1. This model is 3-4 years old
2. No usb type-c port
3. After placing the order, I noticed that it is priced lower on other sites",5
"Good picture quality.
Speaker sound volume is decent. Don't expect much.
Auto brightness works ok. Seems bit slow to adapt to ambient light.",5
"I was delighted by the way it was perfectly packed and sandwiched. Loved it.. Also, it works great.. using it now regularly as a preferred monitor.. must go blindly with this brand.. they are awesome!!!! THANK YOU for delivering a wonderful product.",5
Very good monitor best relief in terms of eye care if you are looking for eye care monitor go for this with out any doubt best monitor @9.2k picture quality is good,5
Smooth font and clear text. I had hp 22es but it was different and i got eye strain. Got this one and used 0toper contrast + sharpness + blue light filter on. You won't feel it after several hours. Buy a pair of this and use for development. At this price point is good.,5
"I mainly used it for office purpose . The sharpness is good and letters are clear . It is not painful for eyes even when look into for 8-10 hrs . I have not used it for videos or gaming , so no comments on that purpose . But it is very good for office purpose",5
This morning suddenly the monitor was flickering and not sure what was the issue ! I am not sure how can I claim warranty for this since the return period in amazon is completed.,1
"Very poor quality display. Only given a VGA cable in the box, No HDMI cable. The texts appear with a diffusive color, hence reduces the crispness ....",1
It‚Äôs a must have at home/work. Picture quality is perfect and anti glare works very well. I have also tried for gaming and it seems to be okay. I recommended this for users who work at night.,5
"Amazing product, Good and very clean and clear picture quality, Colours and option for blue light adjustment is great. Speaker sound quality is good but very low as low watt speaker. Overall great product and must buy if you are looking for both TV as well as Monitor for your CPU.
Thank you!",5
"The display quality is really good, even the speakers are good , some say speakers aren't good at all, but believe me it's really good .
The 'build quality', 'cable management' , 'look', everything is just awesome.
Overall a great porduct .... Liked it very much.",5
"I have 2 of these monitors. Work fine for the price and purpose (office work)!!
Just add a HDMI cable guys c'mon! Who uses VGA cable with a 8k monitor!??",5
Could not ask for more. Meets all my requirements. Have been using Elite series monitors from HP for a long time and this one is no less in performance and quality. Very satisfied!,5
"My son uses this for his online classes. The quality is adequate for home use. However, recently the monitor flickers for 30 mins and goes back to normal after. This is quite strange for a product which is brand new.",4
Build and color reproduction quality is top notch. Highly reccommended compared to other brands.,5
"Pricing is not high. Not at all good for graphic artists. The resolution is low than expected. Audio speakers provided is substandard and even cheaper than any Chinese toys. Sure, it is flicker-free.",2
I got cheated the picture quality sucks see the video you will under would never recommend this monitor üôè,1
I had purchased an AOC 27 inch curved monitor and as compared to this monitor it does not stand anywhere. This is a very light it and almost bezel less monitor a wonderful purchase.,5
Screen started flickering after 2 weeks by which return window has closed .... WORST PURCHASE EVER !!!,1
Worth for just 13.5K. Best choice. Speaker is not bad. Gives you a frameless feel. Ideal for my research work.,5
the picture quality looks ok.i am feeling uncomfortable if I see the monitor for a longer duration. I feel eye protection does not work as expected.look and feel of the monitor is good.,3
As a monitor.,5
"Very good monitor for day to day use for word excel, mails, web browsing, movies use cases.. pls make sure that you sit atleast 3 feet away for best experience",5
"It is honest and my first review on amazon. The Monitor comes with very descent look and Amazing features under this price. only chinese company can did this. That is allrounder monitor for gaming,blogging,photography & movies. just go for it.",5
The correct specifications are not provided for this product. This monitor needs 16 mA current which is not normal power connection. Amazon customer service accpeted their mistake of not providing correct specifications but could not replace the product. This is really pathetic,1
"value for money, excellent display with both VGA and HDMI option along with audio output and speakers.

Cons: don't expect more for audio sound.",4
"Nice Screen overall, Go for it.I am using it for CCTV.",4
"Speaker sound is very bad
when the light sensor is working slows hands the machine
slightly heavy",4
"Worth buying it.. although audio volume is low but enough for the user.. brightness is gud and also light sensor works great. I use it for graphic designing, color brightness and sharpness is appreciable. Recently bought 2nd same monitor for my uncle.. working great.. surely recommend",5
"You get really good Features value for money.

Inbuilt Speakers.
Blue eye protection
Anti Glare eye Protection",4
"Bought this for office. ordered 2 monitors. The monitors are perfect match for office environment.
Definitely a worth buy for office and Home",5
Speaker quality is very bad. Less sound than my mobile phone. Screen is good in terms of size and automatic brightness control but price are still high according to the cost of 24-inch screen.,3
Clarity is zero. Images are blurred. Only for Height adjustment feature is best but screen glaring is more not suitable for office use for more than 2 hours. waste of Money,1
"Not much difference from TN panel in terms of colour n viewing angle. The speakers are of no use.
but otherwise the monitor looks classy.",4
"Decent price, good quality",5
"1. Very Good monitor with low blue light settings
2. Nice cable management arrangement provided
3. (Negative) :HDMI cable is not provided but is mentioned in the included set of accessories.",4
"Definitely worth the money. Adding the mount accessory, I am able to use it with its full potential. Durable for sure.",4
Got it during sale. Amazing value for money at that price point. IPS panel has excellent colour reproduction. Very happy with the purchase. Added a monitor arm to make it even more versatile.,5
"Better for Basic editing ,Movie and day to day work
Got it only 7000 (AMAZON GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL SALE)
Colors are punchy
4/5 Stars
Buttons working properly
Brightness is good
Wire quality is better",5
Can serves the purpose but better go for original branded monitors like dell etc. These are China products. Just serves the purpose.,2
"I bought 24"" with height adjustable fir 13k, it is worth price, colour is so good, firm design, looks fancy. Other technical specifications u can refer it's manual. But over built in quality is good and good customer experience.",5
"This is my third monitor from Benq, using from almost 6 years. As usual Best product quality and picture quality... anyone can go with this monitor instead of spending 3 to 4 thousand more to buy Dell or HP or LG.... Good design good picture quality working well for me...",5
"This is my second BenQ monitor purchased. Very good quality. Worth for price, good for eyes and no strain. Recommend to continuous workers... I love BenQ :)",5
"The best monitor I have ever used. I have used several monitors before like Samsung, HP, Acer, LG. But none of them can hold a candle to this beauty. Response is very fast. It's even good for gaming. Truly the best monitor in this budget.",5
Liked the screen. Picture quality is good.but eye care is basically an eye wash. I had to manually reduce the brightness to make is suitable for eyes.,4
"After having experienced the product I felt this is an overhyped product. the Dell monitor that I had before was much better than this.

Height Adjustment is the only added plus. Rest is OK. Not very great !",3
"Two HDMI ports and one VGA port allow multiple inputs. Picture quality is good and the built quality is also good.

In built speakers are decent and enough when sitting close but additional speakers are required for watching movies in a bigger space",4
"Good Monitor. Speaker is just for name sake. VGA, HDMI, Display Port, Audio In and Out ports available. HDMI cable provided with the package.",4
I am using this display for over a month now and it has been a great experience so far. I am using the as a second dispay for my office work. It has very clear picture quality and no stress on eyes. Can work all day with this. Worth it!,5
"Using the product for more than 1 year, till now I found no issue. Eye protect is one the best feature and it works without fail and respond to light immediately. I spend around 9 hours during WFH.",5
"Already there is a dead pixel in 1 month and they say a single pixel is not covered in warranty and now they say its out of stock.. just random answers. They have the worst support ever.

Never buy any Benq product.",1
"Using since last 2 years. No problem at all. Good product. But if you want to play high garphic, then it is not ok. Because it offers maximux 60fps",5
"Superb Monitor. I like it a lot, just the Brightness Intelligence makes the screen bit more brighter then what would i expect, but doesn't hurt the eye which is really good.",5
Amazing delivery and package from Amazon. Always trustable delivery. excellent monitor for long office hours and reading.....,5
"Defect appeared on second day of using (refer images), product return and refund received on same day of return.",1
"I like everything except one problem, first they send me completely damaged monitor, on complaining I got replaced with newly packed monitor, still there is one pixel damaged in it.
I dont know either it's handling problem from courier end or a manufacturing defect.",3
"Worth the purchase for a height adjustable monitor.
Good picture quality, with various display modes",5
"Display quality is good, not bad. But Inbuilt speakers is very poor, sound is very low in maximum value",3
"Very well build quality. Edges are really small which improve experience.
Light censor is remarkable which make product unique.

Ben q also take care for health that's thay provide blue light protection system

Very well design and developed with care..",5
"The picture quality and the built of the product are great. Ccomplete satisfied with the product. It comes with a decent set of speakers, along with two HDMI ports and a VGA port. Great product and features in this price range.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Amazing product and colour quality at a good price. Worth buying during sales. But for pro gamers 60hz refresh rate is not enough. I am a budget user so for me this monitor with bezel less and ips panel is nice.",5
"Missing back panel cover üòìüòìüòìüòì
missing part and accessories",5
Everything is fine but the eye care doesn't seem to work as expected or I don't find any difference of this aspect called eye care,4
"Value for money. Best for office use.
Don't expect good sound from inbuilt speakers they are just good to have. Better buy 2.1 Speakers to have best experience while using this for movies and other OTT stuff.",5
Wonderful display. It's anti-glare screen so no light reflection issues. Can use for long period of time without causing any fatigue to eyes. Display quality is amazing. I would have preferred the product to be able to adjust height.,5
"This monitor is really good if you have a long screen time because your eyes will not strain at all. I use it for playing video games and it works good for that purpose too, although you can always get a better monitor for a gaming but benq is the only brand i trust.",5
"Best in class.
Not for gaming perpose.
Quality is good enough.
Ambient light sensor is working well.
Boot time is also fast.
I use with VGA cable.
Because my laptop don't have a hdmi port so there is little lower quality for small words.",4
"Such a nice Nd super monitor ,big screen for doing tasks Nd watching video is fantastic I connected through a hdmi cable so quality is amazing after two months I am writing this,seller is trustworthy, Amazon good delivery.",5
"Budget friendly monitor with IPS panel. Picture quality is good and its stand is also designed nicelly with sturdy build quality. Speakers are just average, it is better to use external speaker.",4
"The colors on Benq screen are completely different from that of laptop. Very stressful to eyes, brought it for kids for online classes, not useful as of now. Raised a complaint with Benq regarding the brightness.",2
"This monitor is worth for the money, comes with 2 HDMI ports and one VGA. Display quality is very good.",5
"Best budget monitor for watching movies and other stuffs.
Pros - cost, easy to install, vibrant colours
Cons - It's not premium monitor so pinch dark black u cannot expect so light bleeds when it's absolute black",5
Very bad product and after sale service. No audio from monitor with HDMI connection. Call center gives no support and service center does not pick up only.,1
"Awesome, grabbed 24"" for 7700 using sbi card. This monitor is simply awesome no complaints. Value for money. Color nd picture quality far better than LG and HP monitors. Only dell monitors are better than benq but dell's cost is high, this is best.",5
"Monitor performance is good. Screen is wide and auto brightness adjustment. I think In-Built Speaker will work only, if we use HDMI cable.",4
"Low volume.
Height cant be adjusted
Picture quality Good
Connected with fire stick",3
"I got a defective item where one line of LEDs was messed up. So I can't exactly review this monitor. It did look good and if the screen worked I would have definitely kept it but unfortunately, it was defective. Amazon did accept the return and I'm glad about it.",1
Was looking for options in more popular brands and a local retailer suggested that BenQ is worthy one. Multiple input/output options makes it very convenient. Upto the expectation. Eye care technology is of great value.,5
I found this monitor to be perfect for working from home. The size is just right and the ability to adjust height very easily is extremely handy. The display is very nice and easy on the eye.,5
"Arrived in time, easy to assemble.has various modes for reading, gaming, watching movie etc.comes with HDMI cable. overall look and performance is good",5
quality is very good.The product was delivered to me. It has a black dot on the screen.amajon replacement product very fast.,5
"Good monitor, be aware the monitor comes with a 16A cable.",5
Awesome monitor with good brightness and contrast to get younWork done from home. It is also good for gaming even though the refresh rate is a little low.,4
"Everything is good at this price. Suitable for connecting as additional monitor to the small laptops
Cons: corners emits some light when the monitor has blank screen signal.",4
"When the monitor arrived, there was a grid of red dots in the center of the screen visible only when displaying darker colours. These days are also accompanied by white patches. The bottom left corner of the screen is very dim compared to the rest of the screen.",1
"Picture quality is excellent for this price range. In built Mono speakers are an added advantage. Worth the money.

Power supply from big 3-pin plug and it will not fit into conventional power sockets. You need to buy an adapter.",5
"Its nice but was not happy with the inbuilt speakers quality, its really bad.

Have used Dell Monitors and found Dell to be far better than this brand.",3
"Picture quality is superb. Anti-glare feature is also marvellous. Real IPS panel. Thank you Benq, Amazon and your team.",5
"The bezels are thin, the colors are accurate, bright and vibrant, good for editing and multimedia consumption. Great purchase!!",5
Overall good experience. But sound from in built speakers could have been stronger.,4
"Quite happy with the product. The bezel is so slim that it feels like it does not exist. Bright colors. If I have to nitpick, the speaker could have been better.",5
"I love the thin bezel design.
I would appreciate if it had hdmi 2.0 support.
Color and contrast is the best.
Better viewing angles.",5
"Monitor is listed as LED in amazon portal and label on box it arrived in is LED, but the tag on monitor is LCD and manual is for LCD. Which one is it? Power plug was the large 16A which I was not expecting and now need to get an adapter or change wall socket.",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 This is a really amazing product , the only thing not there is hight adjust",5
"We got this product today ( august 13) .. we were excited to use this product. But when we switched on the monitor , we realized we got a damaged product. We placed a replacement order and we are Waiting for the replacement.",1
"Great picture quality. No bluish tinge at the corners. Very soothing on the eyes. The read, office and multimedia modes are very useful. I do not feel fatigue in my eyes at all after working on it all day. Anti-glare is very effective.",5
"My feedback after 10 days.
1. Pics & hd quality is average as of 1920x1080
2. Sound, good as expected for alerts & notifications.
3. Flickering adjustable üëç
4. Body make, specially nearby bezel is poorüëé

Overall based on price it's üëå",4
"The Item I received looked fine from outside.
I used it for 10 days and now the screen is flashing. Very bad giving customers defected Items just to clear the inventory. SO MAD ABOUT IT. ITS HAS BEEN LITERALLY 12 DAYS AND it's NOW NOT WORKING PROPERLY.",1
"After using for more than 2 months (GW2283 - 21.5 Inch) I purchased this monitor (GW2480 24-inch), I like it. This monitor comes only with HDMI cable. GW2283 - 21.5 Inch comes only with VGA / D-Sub cable!",5
"Brought the monitor 2 months back and it's working like a charm, also a good product at a reasonable cost. Totally a value for money.",5
"While the monitor and other information met expectation, giving a heavy-duty three-pin plug that's suitable for heavy duty machines does not help the customer. Customers have to procure a three pin plug that goes into standard socket.",4
"Very good product, it's reasonable in price, can't buy in this price in local market. Speaker sound is not good.",3
Great picture quality and response. Works on both HDMI and thunderbolt ports of my Macbook pro. Works only when connected to direct power on the HDMI port while works also when on battery power mode on the thunderbolt port.,5
Good one for the price pic quality also good. Brightness adjustment is good. Speaker is just poor but that‚Äôs ok for me.,5
"Like : Build quality, price tag, value for money, ease of booking, delivery
Dislike : Description didn't mention about in-box HDMI cable. Due to which I explicitly bought.(What's inside)

Purpose : For WFH, secondary display using HDMI cable",5
I am not a gamer or a photoshop editor. I just watch youtube videos/facebook/general browsing. For that this is very good. dont know other technicalities. But there is a small Bleed/IPS glow whatever you call but for this price it is acceptable.,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The screen from left hand side is getting white day by day, I have checked it by changing multiple wallpaper and same issue. Look's like the screen is defective.",2
"Best monitor for office work. One of the best in class. Auto brightness one is lovely.
Average for Entertainment and gaming.",5
"have been using regularly from couple of months , didn't face any issues.

Pros: its blue light filter reduce stress on eyes

Cons: if you want to watch any videos with low light, picture quality is not so great.",5
"BENQ 2480 24Inch Monitor

The inbuilt speaker is giving very low volume and poor quality... not recommended if you are searching for monitor with inbuilt speakers,2
Very good for office purpose. Have lots of pre-setup display settings for different purposes. Speaker volume is less. Overall good.,5
The product is good but not at all because it's refress rate is soo law. It heats very much.,3
Best in this price tag. Specially icare technology is very best. Look is awesome üëå,4
"I used many benq monitors, all are still working, if benq will increase inbuilt speakers power then that will be great",5
product looks good but the picture quality is very bad . full blurry vision.,2
Working well cable holding in stand. Automatically adjustment of brightness.,5
Really soft on eyes a very cool monitor. One of my friend bought 24 inch one he is also happy.,5
i have connected this monitor with my laptop . i have not faced any issue regarding the monitor. i have been using this monitor more than 1 month. you can buy this monitor.,5

Good looking and easy setup. Would have been good if it came with a VGA cable!,4
"Timely delivery and packaging were great. The screen size, display quality and screen size was as expected. Although since it is a screen, so you might need to have additional speakers if using it for watching a program.",4
Waste Of Money. Not Good. Display problem,1
"Product and packaging is excellent. It comes with a HDMI cable, but really disappointed with the 1watt inbuilt speakers. They're of no use, don't even think of making use of inbuilt speakers. Rest everything satisfies my need. Colour accuracy is üíØ",4
"Good product , nice picture quality (though little pixelated when watch from close distance)",5
"this monitor is good in looks and other features except sound/volume of speaker , very low sound (50-60 % lesser than any mobile phone sound )",4
"What the heck today got a damaged panel monitor! Applied for a replacement

I'll update the review once I recieve replacement.

Update: Ok today I received replacement and it's good, need a month to review",3
This is my second BenQ monitor. Quality is excellent for the price as usual. I liked this model also for its edge-less classy look.,5
I use it for coding and browsing only. I couldn't ask for more. The text is legible and crisp when the monitor is upto 20 inches from me.,5
"Seeing rectangular shapes in display in just 6months usage.
Benq Technician confirmed it to be a panel issue.. Pathetic!!
Now waiting for a replacement..",1
"pretty good monitor, build quality is nice too. definitely value for money product.",5
"Fullhd is good only till 24 inches, after which the picture is not as sharp as it is supposed to be.",3
Good Monitor in this price point. Setting up is easy. You will fall in love,5
"Not even two month .. my kid hit lightly on the table and the monitor shaked and had a slow fall on table, the screen is broken and display went",1
"It's simply the best.However,you need to have high speed internet connectivity so the videos wouldn't be blurred in low resolution or SD. So far so good!!",5
"this is the best monitor in it's class. I compared HP monitor which refresh rate was 12ms. but this benq monitor refresh rate is 5ms. which is good for gaming.
I liked cable arrange in it's stand is very convient.
I didn't like is it's dual stereo speaker which out put is very low and poor sound quality.",4
"I have been using this monitor from the past 4 months for my home office. The quality of the monitor is very good. I particularly like the eye-care feature, which reduces the strain on the eyes. Overall very satisfied with the product",5
"HDMI cable is not available with the product.
This is one of the worst product, better to go for LG
Power switch is larger, doesn't fit any of the socket, you need to buy extra socket for this.",1
"You can simply go for it! The height adjustable monitor screen is pretty helpful (it can be tilted 90 degree and moved up and down) for your all kinds of moods - from intense gaming, to calm night time reading and writing to regular office work!",5
"Cons
-disappointed after when I saw dead pixels within 2 weeks

Pros
- Elegant display
- stunning color accuracy",4
GOOD QUALITY monitor. but there is no USB port. and the audio ports are not easily accessible.,4
"The monitor is really good. The picture quality was awesome, but the sound is really bad. You can barely listen to it but, most people use speakers so it should not be a problem. Besides that it is the best you can get in this price.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Within 24 day's display got a problem, rectangular Ring appears on display",1
"Bought it today for Rs 8775. So far so good. It's just new, need some more time to experience the product quality.",4
"It's very good product, I have taken for doing my office work which is related to coding, documentation etc.. And I am find it very helpful in my day to day use... Very good.",5
"The Monitor is Best itself. We get the same Quality as of HP Monitor, which is slightly Costlier than this.
Moreover there is a light Sensor which automatically controls the Display Brightness according to the Light Conditions.",5
"Definitely not good for games..It's been 3 Months and my screen started glitching, playing games continuously after 3 or 4 hours..Recommended studying and codin, even after use of long long hours, i hv never met an issue..",1
"Excellent but very delicate.
Value for money.
Sharp & Light weight. Fine quality picture. Just new age equipment...",4
I am happy with the product but I did not get the hdmi cable mentioned in the product description,4
Picture clarity and color sensations is awesome ..you can go for it .. ignore sound you can add speakers,5
It's a very good product with minimum bezels and a 1080p brightness intelligent display. The low blue light mode works really fine. The User interface of the screen is obsolete. Don't expect built-in speakers to deliver an output of even 1W.,4
It‚Äôs awesome! Worth the money. Bought this due to the eye strain as part of Work from home! Helped a great deal...!!,5
It is a good monitor. It has a great cable path that help to hide the cables. Definitely not for gaming in high fps. It is 60 in max you can get which enough for gaming. But if you are looking for high fps don't buy it.,5
Does everything as described. No concerns since we started using it.,5
Bought the product a month ago . It was working fine but today I'm seeing vertical lines flickering eveywhere on the screen. Worst experience ever from Amazon. I'm in need of replacement,1
I would like to thank BenQ for this amazing monitor & it works well will my Macbook air. One important recommendation for the MAC/ Windows users is dont connect to VGA rather use HDMI for the better display resolution.,5
"Solid build quality and antiglare makes it a good device to work long hours.

Physical buttons and the default purple could have been avoided for a premium feel.",5
"Product look generally good, easy to assemble; working well-used last 2 days
However, it is bulk and heavy. The display technology is LCD; the word LED in product title is misleading.",3
Great product... Speakers not too good but for that price its worth it... Great value for money... You might want to tinker with the screen settings to get it up to your mark... The default settings my not be the one for you...,4
I had dell 24 inch monitor as well but after using this monitor I can see clearly notice huge difference in picture quality and viewing angles considering the price .. benq is much better,5
"This is great value for money product
Bezel less display, with antiglare finish is amazing, may be inam not a fan of glossy finish screens.
Intelligent brightness works pretty much well.",5
Inbuilt speakers are useless. 3.5 mm Headphone socket useful to connect soundbar and use it as a tv. Overall worth the money. Using as a monitor and a tv with a amazon firestick.,4
As I find that is worst product nothing working on settings button and speaker also never works . Ifni connected headphone nothing is working only works sound on laptop,3
Its best monitor in this price range for multipurpose usage.,5
"Have been using this monitor for 3+ months and I'm really satisfied with this.
This monitor I'm using it for the WFH ; its on par with my HP monitor in Office.
Comfortable on the eyes for 6-7 hrs/day use.",5
"BenQ-27inch received in good package, working satisfactorily. Picture quality & brightness is good @ screen resolution 1920 X 1080.
Interested customers may go for it.",4
Power plug that is provided will not fit in your normal sockets. You will have to either buy another plug or some sort of convertor. I already had a spare plug that I am currently using,3
"A great product from BenQ. Best choice when comparing the 27"" monitors list, Eye friendly technology enhances the working hours with its eye care technology. I really got Money's worth.",4
Nice,5
"From 3 months of usage I haven't faced any issues regarding color, screen tearing or any such problems,
I use it mainly for designing and normal gaming.
I think for the price this is the best monitor having a very thin bezel and provides tilt adjustment which is not provided by other manufacturers at this price. I think it's worth a buy!",5
Everything is good but Height adjustment is very bad,3
"The display is not consistent and display flickers on some part of the display, for example, dashed lines drawn anywhere show blinking effect anywhere on the screen. That's what happens when you choose the cheapest option.",2
"If you are in tight budget, then go for it.
plus points: two HDMI ports, 16Watt power consumption in ECO mode.",5
"The only negative is it doesn't have USB ports but otherwise, it is really worth for the money. This is the only budget-friendly model in this size category. I strongly recommend to go with this model.",5
"Nice monitor at 8k-9k range.
Monitor is good. sleek and almost bezel-less. because of 24inch i use it as a dual screen.
Because of offer i got it for Rs.8541
Have been using it since 2 months and didn't face any issue.",4
Dead Pixel in the panel. Quality not good,1
Using as extended screen for the laptop from 1 year. No issues till now.,5
"When I received the first monitor, there were dead pixels, I got a replacement , even that had dead pixels. I don't know if this is an issue from BenQ or the seller. Anyone else buying this, make sure you do a thorough monitor test",1
"Picture quality is very good but rating it 4 cos connectors are not provided for all the available slots, have to buy them seperately.",4
"please immediately connect and check, if you find anything suspicious with display request for replace, I missed the replace window and I connected few days later of receiving the product. Now struggling to get it fixed.",1
"Have been using it for a month and so far so good. Picture quality is quite good, resolution is fine, sound is poor.
Stand is not that much strong, monitor shakes if it is under a ceiling fan.",4
"My kids loved it.
Audio is not bad, HDMI cable takes care of both audio & video..",5
Product is not IPS Model it's refurbished old monitor n One layer is Polarised on Led panel display don't go for it it's waste of buying Go for Lg Hp other models,3
"Hi,
Worst product and worst service.
Some how my screen has gone, now to replace screen I have to pay 9790+18% gay. Which I can buy new monitor.

Better look for other product where service is better",1
In built speak is not that great. Benq customer service is absolutely pathetic and irritating.,3

"Best Monitor for Multimedia.
If you're a gamer this monitor doesn't suit you.
If your budget is 10k then I will suggest this monitor.
I appreciated for the quality and colour accuracy of BenQ.",5
Pixel density is low with macbook pro. If you want to read text then go for higher resolution. Good for video streaming.,3
One of the best purchases I've made. It's a spectacular product. I've been using it for 3 months now and it's just amazing. I love how big it is.,5
"Awesome monitor in such relevant price.
I rated 4 stars for gaming bcoz it is 60 Hz Monitor. But still best monitor for gaming in that budget.
It has speakers with not very bad output.
Other features are good.
Best for Graphic designers and Video editors.
üëç",5
"Dont buy this. It has 15 Amps power chord, which is hazardous, unsafe for kids to use. I dont reccomend this.",1

I bought this monitor for comfortable long hours of work. Meets my expectations and will update my review after a few days of usage,5

"Its a good product,picture quality super,looking also super...",5
"Pros:
Sharp & crisp
Sensor based auto brightness
No bleeding(IPS)
Good price
39 month warranty

Cons:
Displayport cable is not included",5
Comes with power cable and HDMI cable. Power cable is 16A 250V. However bought an additional 10A cable because I didn't have 16A socket.,4
"I‚Äôm using this monitor for office purpose. Since last 2 months I‚Äôm working on this monitor, till now it‚Äôs working fine. Never tested its speakers as I‚Äôm using it as an extension for the laptop.",4
Just go for it,5
"While quality and clarity is good, this does not come with hdmi cable with bkx. So if you add cost of hdmi cable you can buy a better branded monitor.",4
"I'm using this Monitor with MacBook Air 2017 using Amazon Display cable. Its working awesome. I'm using this for 3-4 days. Its quality is awesome and very fine color, Best for eyes. But Too much Light leakage in the upper left corner.",3

Had to buy another power cord",4
"Hi, Though it is an overall OK kind of product I expected a better display. there is white glow/leakage, I think that is making this display not so clear.",3
I just received the product yesterday the initial impression is good also I would like to say that the display is really good on eyes and the picture quality is not that good as I had a costly monitor before but I will get used to it,4
Been using for a couple of weeks and the screen starts flickering.. not sure why is it. can I return it,1
"One of the best monitor with eyecare technology, I used to get eye strain with previous monitors, but not with this BenQ. Its worth the price and really a must buy.",5
"There is some backlight bleeding but that doesn't affect the display when working in a well-lit room. It uses an LG AH-IPS display panel, so the picture quality is similar to the LG monitors in the same price range. Overall, it's a decent monitor for the price.",4
"This is the best Screen on this budget. However, I feel cheated when the price came 15990/- after two days I purchased it for 17460/-",5
This product has many good reviews and i trust them. I am assuming i have got the defective product which has such horrible painful to look at text display. Picture quality is great though. Will edit this review after the replacement :),2
"Good Monitor for general use like programming or as a external display.

Picture quality is also good.

Not recommended for Gaming.",5
Excellent product for the price. Did not expect it to be that great.. have been using many other monitors at office and home but this was a pleasant surprise. The picture quality is quite clear and sharp and less harsh on the eye.,5
"Product is as in the description..
nd the display quality is superb at this price

but the is high chance to damage this product.. becz the pannel is not rigid or firmly attached to the frame...

so more risky to get pannel damage",3
What they say about the eye strain stuff is so true. Your eyes will only fatigue out of your laptop screen. This screen will remain strain-free. Kudos to this particular feature.,5
"Good considering the price.
24 inch Eye Care, IPS Panel with VGA, HDMI, Audio in, Headphone Ports and in-Built Speakers.
Speakers sounds only for noise free environment.",4
Really good. Affordable. With swivel and good on the eyes,5
This monitor is really good for this price. The advantage is it has 2 HDMI and 1 VGA. Good looking product finish. I recommend buying this product.,5
About this monitor everything is good but if it comes on the in-built speaker it doesn't performs so well but if i talk about its worthiness at this price then this monitor is really very excellent.,4
I have purchased it for WFH using for 4 months no issues till now.,5
"You Only get a 15 Amp socket power cable with this monitor.

No HDMI cable also.",2
"A perfect big screen monitor for office work and other personal stuff. Used for weeks and no issue till now. In fact ordered one more.
.Go for it.. no second thoughts",5
"It was nice product but looks 0.5inch small in height. That's ok. Good for WFh and kids as well for usage.
Delivered ontime with care as usual. Thanks to Amazon.
Loved it and like Amazon.",4
Nice eye friendly monitor with more than average speakers. Crystal clear picture with amazing clarity. Good for long hours and overall a value for money product,5
It‚Äôs an excellent monitor with this price range.,5
Never buy this Monitor. Right after 2 weeks of usage the monitor started flickering with a weird white tint. Thought it was my PC's problem but this happens even on the Monitors boot screen without connecting to any video source.,1
"This monitor has 16A plug. If you are using 6A socket, you will need 6A to 16A converter socket. There is no HDMI cable included. It has only VGA cable (D-sub).",3

"used it for a dual monitor setup for my work from home.
Definitely worth the money.",5
Good product for this cost. Good clarity. Speaker good for just system notification and audio. Nice secondary monitor for WFH connect to laptop,5
"I brought for photoshop , viewing angles are great was actually surprised seeing the monitor, its a excellent monitor for photo, video editing, just need to work on the colors manually a bit , or else auto works fine",5
"Ordered it mainly for WFH, display quality is good but not the best in this range.
The inbuilt speakers are totally useless, better to use external speakers.
Not doing any gaming so cannot comment on that.",4
If I connect a new device to this the device wants this monitor's speakers to play the audio but audio totally sucks. Everything else is really great.,4
Working well ...... no any problem till now.,5
"Product is good , but some waviness is appears while the monitor is on.Also the invoice bill copy is not received to claim the warranty",3
"Larger than i thought. Bezzel is awesome , sensor is not good , speaker is good but low volume .",5
"Brightness management is best but still there are some tiny issue that you can ignore because of this price. Otherwise this monitor is just great according to its price range and I'm using this from last 2 months now.

I will update here if I will face any issues.",4
"As per the monitor, it‚Äôs really good... picture quality experience... But the additional feature mentioned as speakers are the worst. You barely hear the sound from the monitor",3
Good product.. Working fine from 3months... Only problem is it's big pin which is something unusual,4
"Excellent product, super easy installation. Very comfortable for regular work from home purpose. Laptops create eye strain. This monitor helped to reduce it.",5
Built in audio speaker hardly audible.,1

However, comes with 16 A plug which doesnt fit in the standard Indian power socket.",4

I bough this for my home use and very much satisfied.,5

"It's a alrounder monitor, impressive build quality and performance.",5
"Helping a lot as i used to work on my laptop almost about 16 hours a day. Good picture quality, but sound looks to be low, but i didn't have problem as i have sound system.",5

"Great design, what to say... its a good budget friendly 27 inch monitor.
Couldn't find any in-built speaker.",5

Speaker is bad.....I purchased from Amazon... speaker run only 2 months after not running customer service is very poor,1
"Everthing is good about this monitor, just one issue is when i switched to hdmi, dosplay doesn't go fullscreen, even when the resolution and alignment is set at full hd. but in vga, its xoming full. otherwise its a good to go monitor.",4
It is so good! Much much better than what I expected. I'm using it mainly for work. But even the hd quality is superb!,5

"value for money. perfect size for programming as well as for watching movies and tv series.
anti blue light works great in reducing strain.
picture quality is as expected, no complaints.",5
"Good Monitor, earlier used DELL 21 compared to that everything is fine...",4
I don't expect this type of product . Sound is very low. Brightness is always high no matter you lower it. People like me who spend more time on monitor and wear specs. Don't go for it.,2
"Packing was so disappointed I have ordered amazon fulfilled one but the packing was not minimal it is just the box that company provides not extra box or bubble sheet
I have got some backlight bleeding due to unsafe packing I believe

Overall product is good for this price range",4
"Perfect product at a lesser price of 14,000/-",5
1 star deducted. No HDMI cable. Instead they still ship d'sub cable.,4
I use it as a part of 3 monitor setup for productivity and it is really good. Can be easily wall-mounted. The bezels are thin except the bottom one. Picture quality is top notch.,5
On time delivery. It was well packaged. The product quality is upto the mark by Benq. I waited 3 weeks to write this review. There is IPS glow and not white light bleeding. The picture quality is excellent.,5
"Huge improvement from other screens. As someone who works for 10 hours on PC, much pleasant on your eyes. Less strain on eyes.
Sound isn't gud though.",4
"Just compare the colors from both my laptop and the BENQ Display!! As a designer I had a need a wide range of colors and I can see it properly in this display. Adjustable height is recommended, very helpful.",5
It's great monitor having all functionality with great price,5
"A monitor is good for normal use.
The sound is ok but can be better as any background sound then you can't hear anything from the monitor.",5
Actually worth buying . Narrow bezels gives smart finish look . Purely satisfied . Got with price 8359 after HDFC discount . Which actually money saving buying . Thanks amazon .,5
"Quality in terms of color, resolution and viewing angles is good. Blue filter and auto brightness works well.",5
"It is absolutely perfect for office work.
There is no pain in the eyes after using for 12 hours or more.
Would not recommend for watching netflix of gaming, since it lacks the clarity or the speed",4
Everything good. Speaker volume is average but works fine. If u are looking good monitor just go for it,5
I bought this monitor specifically for its low blue light feature and brightness intelligence technology but after using it I didnt found it useful. Using flux software and adjusting brightness manually is better way.,5
One day the bottom panelf of the screen started to flicker. Had to power it off for half a day then it became fine.,4
"The best thing is the adaptive brightness. The elegant slim bezel design is also what i liked.
The price tag suits best with all the feature. Got in 9.7K for 24"" monitor.",4
The blue light filter is great. height adjustment stand is good and sturdy.,5
"Screen quality is
good.",3
Perfect one. Really loving it. Best packing and prompt delivery.,5

"Amazing for office work. Must buy, if your looking for a desk setup at home. Eye care feature really works when you are working in a dim light.
Cons: Built in Speakers are a let down.",5
Excellent monitor for under 10k. Use it for over 10 hours a day and face no fatigue. Love the inbuilt reading mode that shuts off blue light. No complaints.,5
"Nice product
But for 27 inch monitor PPi is less than 24 inch monitor i.e 80 ppi (27) 96ppi (24)
I think 24 inch monitor is feasible for regular use
27 inch can be used as tv also",5
"I am using this from past 2 months basically I am using this device for editing purpose it's good and clean products very good and geniune product understand 12k
Thanks Amazon.in",5
Picture quality is good. Cable connectivity is good.,5
What a fantastic monitor!! Completely satisfied by its quality and was easily overclocked to 75hz via hdmi cable. Bought it at 12959 on sale. Will order another one for triple monitor setup. Thanks Amazon,5
"Overall it's perfect for productivity like designing, video editing etc. I don't recommend for gamer's because of the low response time and 1080p resolution. It's fine for me anyway and happy with that.",4
"Display is really nice with super thin bezel.

Only Drawback:
Brightness calibration by the sensor is a bit off (slightly on the brighter side even in dark).

"Since it's IPS pannel it has good viewing angle, also picture quality is good I have done Unboxing of this video please visit my channel ""Techy Dabang"" on you tube",4
A quality buy. I enjoy the flexibility to rotate the screen when needed and even adjust the height of the screen as per my needs and situations. Screen quality is very good indeed,5
This is perfect for people who need to sit in front of a monitor for a long time like 2-3hours without break.,5
But I would recommend curved monitor if the size is 27 inch or above,5
"Product is excellent. The rate dropped by Rs1700 incleuing discount, one day after delivery. Now available at 14% reduced price.",4
Picture quality isn't that great! It does the job for a bigger screen for me but if you're looking for a good color ratio and better picture quality look somewhere else.,3
Recieved the monitor from amazone delivery today and found that built-in speaker sound is very low even after increasing the max level from settings. hope its not damage and its only this much it can provide,4
It needs a big power socket. Buy it along with monitor. Also plan for hdmi/ daub adaptor as it has only one hdmi poet and other is display port,3
Amazing display. Love the view angles and price point,4
Using it as a daily driver for my work for home and occasional media consumption.. I could say that it's a value for money product.. You can go for it without giving it a second thought..,5
Good quality. Sound of monitor is little low. But I am fine.,5
"Brought it during prime day at 8300, best for eye care and if u sit for long duration in front of ur PC. Would remmend it for office work and personal use. Really nice.",5
"In fact best monitor in this price range , Go for it with out second thought ..Great color accuracy , Very relaxing on eyes (eye care technology) ..Thank you Benq & Amazon ...",5
would recommend BENQ monitor because this is the company which actually manufacture monitors not like others which get them manufactured somewhere else and just provide their brand name.,5
best for productivity purpose colours are great for gaming I'll give 4/5,4
Great for Photo & Video Editing.,5
Low light contrast not so great,3

"Monitor outlook is ok, but the brightness and picture quality is so good. My long time eye strain are reduced now. Very decent monitor for work or browse.",5
The view angle is not 178 degree as per the specification of the monitor. Not recommended for professional use.,4
The display quality of this monitor is great and also have good viewing angle as it is a IPS panel monitor. Good for productivity and entertainment but not for gaming purpose.,5
Product is as promised. Colors are reflected brilliantly. Very easy to mount on provided stand. Volume of speakers is low. Else it is a good buy!,4

I am using it as Second Screen while Working from Home.
It has a HDMI port but no USB port.
A money worth product.",5
Awesome picture quality. Viewing angles are also very good. A true HD display.,5
Overall good but the sound output is very low. If we can use any external sound bar the product is excellent.,5
The display is sharp and crisp. PPI on the 22inch screen is good for comfortable viewing. Absolutely loved the Brightness intelligence feature. It works perfectly!,5
The monitor switches off whenever there is a fluctuation in power.,2
Don't whether it is a CPU problem or monitor but videos aren't playing well. It has a 60hz refresh rate but still videos are playing with lag.,4
Good,5

 This monitor (BenQ GW2480) is one of the best Full HD display monitor in very less price.
This is the full review of this monitor and lets just do with in the box contents, Pros, Cons and finally the Conclusion.
Feel free to checkout my profile.
-------------------------------------------------
IN THE BOX CONTENTS
-------------------------------------------------
1. Some manuals with one CD.
2. Power Cable.
3. HDMI cable.
4. Monitor itself.

---------------------------------------------
PROS OF THIS MONITOR
--------------------------------------------
1. It comes with a great design and those bezels, I love them because it looks so awesome at looking at that full screen with that almost bezel free design.
2. The viewing experience is just great. This display produces very nice colors and with the IPS LED display it is almost perfect to view from sides.
3. There are also inbuilt speakers and for this kind of design and price they just sounds nice.
4. It comes with HDMI, VGA and Display port input.
5. One of the best feature that I like id that cable management system. Every cable hides perfectly under that cover for cables.
6. There is also a feature of automatic brightness and it works really fine in this monitor.
7. The display quality is just remarkable and it is flicker free display.
8. The stand of this laptop has a great textured design and the same texture is on the back of this monitor.
9. It also comes with the wall mounting holes in it.
10. Finally coming to the price than, I think this kind of price and a the features that company is offering is just great.
-------------------------------------------
CONS OF THIS MONITOR
-------------------------------------------
The only thing that I did not liked it that it does not come with the VGA cable in the box.

CONCLUSION: Finally, It is a great monitor. Comes with almost bezel free design, Automatic brightness, wall mounting and other great features. For these all I think this kind of price is just fine and it makes the way to my great buying list and I am happy with it.",5
"I used this monitor to build my own cost efficient and stylish AIO! This is a gorgeous monitor with the following specs that fit my needs:
1. Edge-to-edge full HD display which makes it look larger than a 24""
2. Built in speakers
3. VESA compatible - for mounting my NUC box
4. Cable management - to effectively conceal the cables and retain the look of an AIO
5. Not too expensive
6. Good looking base
Cons: It came with one stuck (always on) red pixel. I used PixelHealer program to get rid of it and it's perfect now.

I'd definitely recommend this monitor.",5
"I bought this monitor as a secondary screen. overall quality is good specially in this price range. I already have Dell S2415H which is amazing. This dell monitor is discontinued, so i decided to buy a chep monitor to do my video editing work. I was expecting that this Benq monitor will have glossy ips pannel like my dell one, but it's not. it has matt finish ips pannel. so if anyone is looking for glossy ips pannel then it's not for you. I found only one downside in this monitor and that is the brightness level. it is not that much bright if i compare it with my dell one. But it's quite perfect for non editors and for home use. you won't notice much difference in color reproduction. However I won't recommand this as a primary screen for photo and video editors. Build quality is bit chrap though this is expected in this price range. Overall I'm very much satisfied with my purchase for secondary screen. Here i would like to say special thanks to amazon for timely delivery and replacement of my received damaged product. I just placed a replacrment of my product within one or two hours of receiving it. And they replaced it very next day with a new monitor. It was a great experience to shop with amazon. Where I had faced so much difficulties with othe online shopping site like flipkart and shop clues.",4
"Im a hardcore developer , and at times likes to play games , this monitor compelled me to write this review as i hate samsung products . This time i had a wide variety to choose from within my budget of 50k. I had chosen , this one , and after buying when i explored its features and options to adjust display , Im very delight at this product.
Using it with my dell 5520 workstation which is 4k itself.
P.S. : Dont get confuse with 144hz and curved screens if you are not hardcore gamer with budget more than 50k for monitor.",5
"I have purchased it and then returned it for replacement. The replacement had come with two cables as the original however it is supposed to come with four cables. Moreover, the cables are not BenQ. They're from local manufacturer.",1
Excellent product. The best in this price range. Display is sharp and the colour are vibrant. Extremely good design. The speakers are not very powerful. My fan at full speed completely frowns out the sound from the speaker. It has has audio out which is useful in such scenarios.,5
Not good for using as an external monitor for your laptop. It gives good amount of eye strain. I wish I could have returned this product back to Amazon but it's not returnable.,2
"Amazing screen and colour reproduction
Fairly light weight
Packaging was good as always
Ambient light sensor works like a charm
But vga and audio cable was missing from the package",4
"It's good, worth the buy",4
Wriring early review. Product is good (seems like it has bleeding edges /backlight bleeding).,4
Excellent monitor. Good Val ue for money.,5

"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Summary: - rec'd damaged, then replaced. Becomes faulty after 18 months, 47 days taken by customer F1 service centre to replace after weeks of extremely pathetic customer service. WILL NEVER BUY BENQ AGAIN.

18-month Update June 2019: monitor developed fault (review downgraded to 2*)

Monitor became faulty and completely unusable in July 2019. On one hand this is quite unacceptable for the product, it was still not as bad as the experience with the appointed service centre. While I was initially given an early replacement, it was a wrong monitor (27"") and was taken back by the service centre, then they gave me a standby (lower model) and made me wait over 6 weeks for the actual piece, whilst lying, behaving rudely and displaying altogether unprofessional conduct. They sent another wrong monitor (second time), their employees routinely passed the buck, and showed signs of gross incompetence. Please view my public review of F1 Service Centre on Google.

1-Year usage update 28-03-19:

The monitor has served me well so far - definitely great bang for your buck. However, the after-market type power cable supplied with it (as mentioned below) has a terrible connection with the pins at the back of the screen - it comes loose easily and I hear sparking all the time due to the loosened connection. That is definitely an irritant.

Update 30-01-18:

Received the replacement on time and everything is OK so far. The HDMI and power cables included are not original BenQ, obviously a reason why the price is low on the listing. It took a bit of effort to power the screen because the cable isn't 100% fitting the pins, so it had to be pressed in hard.

The screen itself is good, decent colour, contrast and viewing angles. So far so good.

**Old review 26-01-18** (1 star):

This isn‚Äôt so much a product review as it is for the seller!

Firstly turning the screen on took ages, I do not know why. The LED light came on for half a second and went off quickly thereafter, refusing to turn back on. I kept trying, it finally worked after a few minutes. On turning the screen on there was a large black patch at the top of the screen, about an inch in diameter; along with several vertical and horizontal lines across the screen. See pics for reference. Had to order a replacement and I am hoping I will receive a working product this time, as there are no refunds with computer monitors as per Amazon policy, only replacements. So choose wisely as you will be stuck with whatever you order.

As far as everything else goes: Received the product on time, it was packaged well enough. The screen itself is fantastic quality, lovely textured matt on the back, cable management is nice. It is sharp and a good size for desktops (one might choose the 27‚Äù version GW2780 for bigger viewing experience, although sharpness might be affected negatively slightly because the resolution is still only 1080p, and 1440p is the recommend minimum resolution for 27‚Äù screens. I have used a 27"" 1440p and can attest to that.

After 5 mins of use I'd give this screen 4-5 stars easily. Will update once replacement arrives.",2
"This is my 2nd LED monitor from BenQ. Earlier one was BenQ V2200 Eco model which i bought approx 8 years back which is still working great. When i looked for 2nd monitor for my needs, i evaluated various models and narrowed down to this one. On the very first day, i thought the monitor was bright and less in saturation levels (in comparison with my earlier BenQ). After the initial use of couple of days, this monitor proved to superior on all front (Clarity, eye friendliness, etc) and you will never get tired of working with this monitor. It is eye friendly and the in-built display modes are quite suitable as it is. No customization is required. Now, I mostly use this monitor for all my needs. Go for it and never regret it. You can also watch youtube for comparison with other monitors before making the purchase!",5
"This is a steal for 10000 rupees. I buyed it for more cheaper at offline market, that's the reason why it dosent shows verified purchase. This is a awesome monitor for color grading with 96% sRGB gamut.
FOR GAMING-
It has a 5ms (fast) and 14ms (normal) response time which makes it a decent monitor for gaming.
FOR COLOR GRADING-
It has a IPS display with 96% sRGB gamut and 16+ million colors.
---PROS---
IPS DISPLAY
24"" display
Tilt able display
awesome colors
----------------
---CONS---
Bit late response time so not a go for gaming
60hz which could have been 75hz or more
Bezels could have been more slim
------------------
CONCLUSION
A must buy monitor. OP for color grading but decent for gaming. But, if u have more tight budget then you can got for LG or a more smaller BenQ model",5
"Received Benq Monitor on 20th July 2020 morning. During opening itself observed that the monitor box had two holes and sticker on the box front was removed(proof attached).
This led me to take pictures of all the items inside during unboxing.
When opened the seal of the box, I was shocked to see the protective thermocol on one of the side was broken.
The power cable pack, HDMI cable pack, Warranty card/CD pack, Monitor stand pack were all Pre opened already. Meaning there were not in a packed state at all.
After the assembly and connected the monitor to power source and through HDMI cable to Laptop, I was totally shocked to see the Monitor with broken display with all the vertical and horizontal lines(proof of pictures attached).
There were many scratches over the monitor display as well.
I was very disappointing to see the Seller has sent the defected piece to the customer. Not at all satisfied with the Seller & packaging.
Hence returning the product.",1
"I purchased Benq 21.5 inch monitor. I must say it has good colors and decent contrast and brightness. Watched 'army of dead'. a pleasant experience at this price. I used it for couple of days for office work and its doing good.
However, there is a catch. The power cable provided is 16A 250V which does not fit normal indian sockets.
16A socket is something used for Microwave ovens and Washing machine as they draw additional power.. You must take additional headche of buying power cord with this product.
I have given two stars as BenQ is not in the senses to provide such cable.
And if the BenQ has thought thoroughly on this and if monitor indeed drwas such power for 16A plug, then I must provide one star to this heavy power consuming product.",2
"This is indeed good monitor for web surfing, readi, day to day office work or the programing. When compared with Dell monitor side by side (Dell on left side) the color reproduction on Dell monitor is better and more saturated. I have fine tuned all benq monitor settings but still it could not match the colors of Dell. However don't get me wrong until you are not doing Photoshop or graphics work this is good choice in generic.",4
"The monitor has very thin bezels at its three sides except the bottom, making it an aesthetically pleasing one. The colours are rich and viewing angle is very good. Its base is very sturdy and has neat cable management. Two HDMI and one D-Sub port gives very good option for connectivity. It though, doesn't have any adaptive refresh technology like FreeSync so its not for hardcore gamers. Though it has speakers but it's trash. I bought for my office work and it has been a good experience.",5
"Hello,

I bought this monitor for using as a Television. And its awesome.

I bought it from Benq dealer @ Chennai and not from Amazon.

The Display is awesome and crystal clear quality picture.
The build material is ok though. Said that its not bad, adequately sturdy. For long term use, better handle it properly. Also there is a cable management tray behind the monitor. Easy to arrange the cables and make it look neat.
The monitor can also be wall mounted with UNIVERSAL VESA wall mount.
There is also a simple easy to install TABLE MOUNT stand that goes with the monitor inside the box. Very easy to install.
The design and aesthetics part of the monitor is simply awesome. Wish the power and navigating buttons were placed on the sides rather than at the bottom.

There are 1x VGA, 1x DIGITAL, 1x HDMI input, 1x 3.5 mm AUX ports in the behind.

The only negative i could find is the SPEAKERS. They aren't loud enough and fit only for insulated small cabins.
Also there is no USB port.

Other than these, it's an awesome monitor. Can buy without hesitation.",5
"This is a good monitor in this price range. I liked it's vivid colors, HD IPS panel, 4ms response rate. viewing angles.

In a dark room you will see some backlight bleeding, which is negligible. Refresh rate could be a little bit more. Speakers are available, that's not bad, but not so much pleasant.

Due to lockdown Amazon could not deliver this, & failed two times. Thant's why I've to purchase this offline.
I'm also using HP 24f which is a little bit better option if you spend some more money.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Hi,
My friend ordered this for me and just now I received the product, but surprised that it didn't have HDMI cable, as I want to connect to HP laptop through HDMI. Please take back the D-sub cable which is provided by default and provide me with HDMI cable.
Thanks
Jay",3
"I am not much of a gamer, but I definitely seek good WFH experience. And this monitor is excellent that way. The auto-brightness feature isn't that great, and the colours are also a bit false. But the resolution is pretty good and the neat cable arrangement allows for a clean workdesk. And i can't praise the matte finish. The glare is zero and I can read everything even with the sun behind in evenings.
I would highly recommend it, and happy with this purchase.",5
"I own a 27 inch model of this, and want to share 2 things about it.
The colour, built quality, brightness levels, blue light filter are all good. Not much problem with the monitor.
But, though the stand is of good built quality, the monitor can be seen shaking at the least impact on the table. When I place my foot in the floor and they naturally shake, if my hands are simply on the table, the monitor can be seen shaking greatly.
Secondly there is no manual brightness control. It seems to be important sometimes. But it's worth admitting that auto sensor works fine.
Also the display antiglare is good..
Overall this monitor can serve a large group of users",4
"To begin with, I must first remind that this is strictly a Budget 27 inch IPS monitor and nobody should expect the 'Wow' factor on it. Otherwise, save up some more money and go for the budget 27 inch HDR version.

At first, I bought LG24MK600M and returned the product next day. Then, I went for this model coz I needed a larger screen for editing and entertainment purposes. I calibrated the colors using AMD control panel and it's quite decent. The images aren't that crispy and the texts have jagged edges but you can't expect more from 1080p on a 27 inch display so it's fair.

Here is my test:

HD Video contents: Plays well without ghosting or lag. But there are minor blurs which isn't that big of an issue.

Photo and Video editing: Good.

Gaming: Tested some popular titles like FIFA 19 (ultra setting on 900p), Need for speed payback (Medium setting on 900p) and Rise of Tomb Raider (medium to high settings on 1080p) with AMD RYZEN 2200G Vega 8 graphics and 8 GB 2400MHZ DDR4 RAM.

Gaming performance: Average with no lag or no noticeable ghosting or blur.

This monitor will run games well with GTX 1050ti 4GB Ram with 16 GB of system RAM (I recommend only a mid range graphic card for a 60hz monitor). It's also a good monitor for fps gamers who have no issues playing games on a minimum 50fps on a 60hz monitor. Colors look good on games.

Overall rating: This isn't an excellent monitor, neither it's bad. It's a good budget monitor. For anyone looking for the perfect 27 inch monitor with excellent viewer experience, I suggest you look for that 4K IPs monitor or wait for year 2050.

Thank you.",3
"GW2480 is a good monitor for the price. The default color settings that comes with the monitor is not good or not optimum. With the predefined preset modes, the display shows either a yellow tint or blue tint. But once you do the custom configuration the monitor looks really good with accurate, vibrant colors, deep blacks etc. I am also pretty impressed with GW2480's low IPS glow and no noticeable back-light bleed anywhere in the panel which itself is a strong plus point of this monitor. The monitor also had excellent viewing angles. Gaming on this monitor is a pleasure due to its excellent color, contrast and fast pixel response with no blur effect. I also tried overclocking the monitor to 75Hz with no issue, I haven't tried pushing her further.

Pros:
-Excellent color, contrast and viewing angles.
-Fast pixel response suitable for gaming and movie watching.
-Supports DP, HDMI and VGA connectors.
-Very low IPS glow and back-light bleed.
-Display refresh rate can be OCed to 75Hz with ease.
-Good build quality. (Samsung, Dell should learn from BenQ)
-Excellent Value/Performance ratio.

Cons:
-No height adjustment.",4
"I bought this offline for same price during lockdown.
1. Look is good .. not glossy and stand is Matt finished so won‚Äôt get any scratch while cleaning
2. Screen is Matt finished so easy to clean and remove dust .
3. So many picture setting to select which is good.
4. Connected amazon stick and it played well and audio I used external speaker with 3.5 mm
5. 3 yrs warranty

1. Good for normal office use or basic. Picture distortion is there .. fast moving video is not clear and blur. Even in YouTube videos watching any dance you will notice their hands are blur when they do fast steps. But For playing normal scenes pic look good. I am not sure this is common in budget monitor. Then we can ignore for this price but for expert users better buy any high refresh rate monitors like gaming monitor for watching HD movies or games.

2. Speaker is not up the level , even for notification it is poor . connected speaker with headphone jack and it able to give decent volume. But still they should have focused speaker sound at least like 5w.

3 . Only one hdmi output",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Received product is damaged. Applied for return, I waited for 20 days to receive this monitor. I really didn't expect like this",1
"I am using this device (BenQ GW2480 24-inch) for more than 4 months. I am satisfied with it. But there is a little Backlight-Bleeding when there is a dark background in your scene. This monitor also has a ""Light Sensor."" But guys, after enabling, this sensor only senses the intensity of the light of your room. This makes only a very little or almost no difference in the existing brightness of the screen according to if there is Full-Darkness or Full-Light in your room. It could have better control of the brightness level according to the sensor's input. Overall this monitor is good in this range. You can buy it.
But the delivery service by the amazon for this product was not satisfactory.",4
"A Good All round Monitor with Nice Colors Reproduction and Detail.
Easy on the Eyes
Inbuilt Speakers need much improvement. In fact they are of no use as you cannot depend on them. Either they should be improved or the feature can be taken away totally and price reduced",4
"After doing a lot research, evaluating 100s of different options and with thousands of second thoughts, I finally went ahead and bought this one... and I can say I'm pretty amazed!
First of all, it looks absolutely gorgeous ;-) you can call it a centerpiece of your desk. I'm in love with the slim bezels. The overall experience is extremely immersive.
The display is pretty awesome, color reproduction is quite accurate. Wouldn't recommend it for the color critical work though!
Just play around with the menu options, slight tweaks in settings will give you the best possible picture. I'm impressed with the sharpness and black levels. No visible light bleeds.
Response times are quite mediocre on all IPS panels so won't blame the product. Casual gaming would be fine but this is not meant for heavy gamers.
Auto brightness feature is quite gimmicky and buggy so please don't expect much. I'd prefer not to say anything about the speakers (just grab a pair of headphones or use dedicated speakers ;-))
All in all it's a great product to have at this price point. You won't have any regrets if you buy this with right expectations. NOT recommended for people who want to buy Lamborghini at Alto's price... Peace :)",4
"Design: Excellent.
Screen: Real good matte screen to avoid any reflection of other lights around.
Picture Quality: Perfectly fine
Built-in Speaker Sound: As good as an alarm sound but not more than that.
Eye Care Tech: It really worked for me. At the first day itself I could feel the difference in my eyes strain level. Far better than earlier used LED screens.

Worth buying, truly value for money",5
"Amazon you should think twice for your add ""apni dukaan""Because If i would have brought it from my nearby electronic shop,they must have help me in this..Now it is just a waste of money for me..I wish i could replace it with something 17""-20"" size monitor..

I wish amazon has any product replacement policy for different sizes!!!They can not do anything in this..If you are selling it under tagline ""eyecare"" Then you must be sure if it is a good size for eye care?I am using it from 2 days,and i feel my eyes tired,Now shifting back to my old Samsung monitor... :(",1
"My main purpose of this monitor is editing video and it's awesome for that.
The 2nd purpose is watching YouTube and it's an incredible experience...
Due to its flicker-free display and auto brightness, it's easy on my eye
For any other queries feel free to ask.
Thank You",4
This is a very good monitor with height adjustable feature. I chose this instead of Dell and am really happy with my purchase,5
"Pros: Meets expectations and serves the purpose of working from home, anti glare feature is good as well.
Cons: does not have the mini HDMI cable for connecting with Mac, had to purchase separately the mini hdmi to hdmi converter cable.",4
"LIked the monitor. the support stand provided is very good. Only problem is that it is very difficult to remove and reinsert since it has the risk of breaking while removing. Else, other features (overall) are good. ease of setup, picture quality in terms of various tech parameters etc..",5

 this is much more than my expectation. pic quality superb.. eye care feature has attract me to go with this monitor and its really amazing.. my eyes stay coolüòç",5
I am using this monitor with my Apple mac mini (late 2014) for development purpose.Eye care technology of this monitor is awesome.It has a Ambien light sensor below the Benq logo which controls monitor brightness automatically.The main drawback is Benq does not provide any HDMI cable with this monitor.,5
"You were selling the product costlier to prime members on presale. My brother placed an order for the product on presale with business account and price for business order was also costlier. Soon after the order placed and as soon as regular sale starts, price came down for all!

So, it seems you are selling products costlier to the prime members and business orders.",1
Volume is not good enough. But its a good product otherwise. Good display and build quality. Good for home office,5
Got the new BenQ monitor but got the defective product.....seakers are not working already plus colour display is also not good,1

Built in speakers so that you can connect chrome cast and use it as a TV. Without the need for a CPU.",5

It has auto brightness as well, which works pretty well.",5

"I would prefer BenQ over Samsung or LG. Trust me, it is totally worth it. I have been using BenQ monitors for official purposes as well and no complaints so far in 3 years!",5
"Why is the power adapter so big? It doesn‚Äôt fit into normal sockets. Can I use 10A power cable, will it have any issues?",4
"I usually spend 12 hours on this monitor, 24"" and height adjustable and no other brand is selling at this price 9500 after discount in April 2020 but recently the price has been increased to 12500 not sure why?",5
"I find the flicker-free description is totally wrong. I am using this monitor and it flickers a lot!!!
So if you are looking for a flicker-free monitor this is not the right choice.",2
"Its among the high-end display panels with an amazingly high refresh rate. Ensure that the workstation has a minimum of 8gb RAM, preferrably a SSD Harddisk. Its an amazing experience so far. The volume is very low, but thats part of the spec.",5
I bought a Benq designer monitor for 20k and it stopped working and after I complained there was not repair or replacement. No support. Avoid,1

Material is not good sometimea screen bleeding occurs. Returned it,1

"Super quality ,,, screen color super ,,,,",5
"Looks wise so good.... This is my review just after unboxing. Didn't feel anything special about the display. No option for custom color/brightness/contrast etc settings. Only standard presets like movie, office, reading etc. For text reading minimum 2+ feet is recommended for decent feel. Otherwise you feel like the text is pixelated due to size. Saw couple of images and small video which was very nice.... Will update this feedback after a month of use... Overall worth the penny if you want to watch movies.....",3

"This is the best monitor in this category. 21.5 inch + FullHD + IPS + 2 HDMI for this price is unbelievable. The only issue is it doesn't have an onsite warranty. Dell provides great after-sales service and onsite warranty but Dell is slightly costlier than this around Rs.10000.

In case if you wonder why this is this cheap is because it designed and developed in 2018 so they have sold lots of these and thus they could get the price lower.",5
"This product has satisfied me. Build quality is good, picture quality is excellent at this price. Compare to other products with little higher prices and same prices, it has much soothing effect. There is no colour bleeding and no ultra sharpness in picture. One can easily work from 20inch distance. You can also watch movie. Speakers are ok (not great). I never expect great speakers with any display unit.
Lastly I can say this is one of the best display unit at this price range.",5
"It's been over 4 months of use, and I am still in love with this monitor as I was on Day 1 when I saw it on delivery. It's very lightweight, runs cool even after runing straight for 32 hours, blacks look good on the screen for the price. Love the way it automatically controls the brightness based on the surrounding, and it really isn't that harsh on eyes. So overall, 5+ for me. Fully satisfied.",5
"It is very good in build quality. Its picture quality is very good. If you have already worked on 14 inch to 15 inch screens, then you should convert to a bigger screen, it is very easy. I have ordered a 27 inch monitor, which I found very good.",5
"like the picture quality and build quality. one thing is that when connected via HDMI cable, we get a little less viewing, almost 1 inch less from each side of the screen. VGA cable gives full edge to edge viewing.",4
Excellent Quality Product. This product is exactly as mentioned on the website. If Amazon provides seven stars on their website!! I will give 7 Stars.,5
This monitor from Benq is just awesome. Great picture quality with reasonable price. Go for it without any doubts.,5
"Never buy it again, old scratched product, packing is torn and scratched.",1

Awesooooooooomeeeeeeeeeeeee,5
"This is a revised review after using it for many months. For the price this monitor is a really good value for office use. I say office use in particular because it has an eyefilter mode which is what I use. In this mode you compromise on picture quality and accuracy of colors but what you get is a lot less strain on the eye. I use it for 10 to 12 hours a day and eyecare is very important for me. The overall colors, contrast and everything are good enough for an IPS monitor. Some IPS bleed is there which is normal. I'm using this as the primary monitor and DellP2419H as secondary monitor in vertical mode.
For gaming I dont like this much. It feels wierd playing CS:GO. I guess you need faster refresh rate for a smooth experience. But I'm a mobile gamer so gaming performance on the monitor is not my preference.
Overall this monitor was a good purchase for work.",4
"1. Very good picture quality.
2. No blurry vision for text document.
3. Matt finish screen.
4. 27 inch, Got in exact 13k.
5. Not good but ok speakers.
6. Its a made in china product.
7. 15 amp, 3 pin socket plug.
Most important, If you are thinking to buy this monitor just because company quoted ""Eye Care Technology"", its FAKE and Useless it always produce much more bright screen beyond your imagination.
It is just a normal IPS monitor like others.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Excellent product and service by Benq. I must say that its the best budget IPS monitor in this price range. I have purchased 2 monitors and they are working like a charm.
- No bleeding
- No Flickring
- Colors are awesome

Highly Recommend.",5
"Pros:
Easy to assemble. one of the best monitor with in 15K, Like three-sided ultrathin bezel design, 1920 x 1080 Full HD resolution, AMD FreeSync technology, T√úV-certified etc.
I have purchase this for office work like coding and debugging not for gaming. really happy with the performance.

Cons:
Power socket is 16A, need to purchase an extra converter.
No Hight adjustable",4
Monitor is good but power plug is very big and it won‚Äôt fit in normal and they have not mentioned this,3
The plug was the only problm with this monitor overall perfect for me,5
Nice product! Easy to install... already 3 months using the screen and no issue at all.,5
Best monitor this segment but but delivery slow,5
Outstanding,5
Absolutely amazing!,5
Really good for Office work. Good quality,5
Value for money.,5
"I would have five star, but it came with a black stain on stand and I am not able to remove it. And also plug is bit one 20 amps it seems, it should have been mentioned in description.
A part from this picture quality and performance is very good. And also remember this product dont have inbuilt speakers. So some extrnal speaker need to be connected.",4
"The problem is in the picture clarity. The left half is absolutely excellent but not on the other side, some yellowish color which dulls the monitor. Have called LG Customer care for service and awaiting his presence to sort out this issue. If not I will soon return the product.

Update: The service person convincing that it is nature quality of the light reflected which appears in white background. Yes, couldn't able to find any yellowish while playing videos. But, still it looks awkward. I usually work with white background software where I do not prefer this rile thing. I'm returning this LG monitor. Thanks to LG and Amazon for this awful experience.

Replaced Product Update: Now Amazon making me not to buy their products.
1. Seal is broken and revamped.
2. There is a bulge/ bump in the frame of the screen.
Returning this frustrating product. And I want my money back.
I think this is my last purchase from Amazon.
@Amazon, Don't play with LG brand, LG has lost one loyal customer because of you.",1
"This is a good 1080p monitor at this price:
i have purchased it @8199 during sale, and i feel it just worth it considering the price the product is well build comes with max 2 years of Warranty do read all the warranty related information on LG website or on the warranty card>
the Monitor comes with a HDMI port, by default i remain on 60Hz but if u want u cant take it upto 75Hz (u need a AMD card running on HDMI with AMD free sync On)
colors are pre-calibrated but the coverage is only 75% of the color gamut
contrast ratio is also good
Dont Get Confused about this Monitor This is a IPS LED montior Not LCD as its written on product name(for a moment i got confused with that)
It is not entirely bezel less there is a small bezel but its doesn't looks bad!

if you are planning to buy this monitor go with!
Hope these informations would be helpful to you all.. !",5
"Excellent monitor at this price range .display is really nice and the colors are all really vibrant. It supports freesync and upto 75Hz refresh rate. You get an HDMI cable too, even though I didn't see it being mentioned in the product page. I am fully satisfied after buying such affordable and budget range Full HD LED Monitor.

Cons:
1. Glossy plastic back and stand finish attract lot of fingerprints
2. Stand can only tilt, there is no height adjustment or rotation feature
3. Only one HDMI Port
4: No Speakers and USB port",5
"This is a splendid product. Very to-the-point approach from the manufacturing perspective. One of the best price-to-performance ratio.

Pros:
1. Freesync is supported. This means if you are using an AMD graphics card, your refresh rate automatically shoots beyond the 60Hz limit.
2. Reader/Custom modes are available. As a user who uses the PC for gaming along with web browsing, movie watching, programming, a reader mode is very much required. Prolonged exposure to vibrant and bright colors are not always the best fit for programming. This monitor takes care of that.
3. Comes with a decent HDMI male-to-male connector. The cable quality might not be world-class but does a decent job of responsive video data transfer, when it comes to quick display changes (like gaming).
4. Minimal bezel at the edges.
5. Beautiful and faithful color representations.

Cons:
1. No horizontal swivel. This is a minor nice-to-have feature. However, the monitor does have adjustable vertical swiveling, which makes up for the missing feature.
2. The main monitor control button (at the bottom base) is a little cumbersome to handle. This could have been better designed.

Two things to take note of:
A. If Freesync is turned on, you might have difficulties getting into BIOS as many motherboards do not support displays beyond 60Hz. It's kinda stupid but worth knowing
B. For the programmers: This is a normal DPI monitor (meaning the Dots-Per-Inch is 96 and so, it does not fall into the high-DPI category). This is just an information. This does not mean that the monitor is good or bad. Just that it is a normal DPI monitor.

All in all, a great monitor. I could not find anything to reduce even a half star from the product rating. 5 stars from me. Been using this for more than two weeks now.",5
"The whole box comes with plastic visible wrapper. So the shipping was awesome in 1 days delivery. However inside the box 1 monitor, 1 stand neck , 1 base stand, 1 cable management clip, 1 HDMI cable, 1 driver cd, and some documents comes. No vga cable . Hence can use your old one. The base stand's design is awesome with half circle shape. Made inside with aluminium finished with hard glossy black plastic. The stand neck and the back side of the monitor also has glossy plastic finish. Back side there 5 ports including vga port named as D-SUB and HDMI port. So I connected my monitor via vga cable cause I have no HDMI port. however ther are wall hanging option too at back. Front side the whole 16:9 ration screen has very narrow literally invisible bezel but when you will switch on the display you can notice very thin bezel at 3 side while the bottom has normal brezel with LG logo and only one joystick switch (Lg likes joystick ) . The resolution of the monitor is pure Full Hd with IPS cinema panel . The panel quality is A++ with very accurate real color production and this is the feature of the IPS panel. IPS panel is very helpful to the editors or graphics designers or gamers. Also this monitor has black stabilizer by which you can easily enjoy the dark scenes on screen. LG is a leading led tv maker company with OLED screen, so it is as expected that it have to be a great panel. The control of the monitor's can be changed either from the utility on screen display software provided in the cd or by the joystick monitor button moving and clicking right left up and down. However the other company's monitor is not so good or balanced cause either they have panel with corner light bleed or faded color grade or less port while this monitor has balanced features with perfect black which makes this monitor great and popular. I damn gurantee that you will not regreat after buying. Also this monitor is protected by Lg's manufacturing warranty. I got this monitor at Rs 6800 with card instant discount. So thanks amazon and thanks seller and thanks LG . Hit Like if you have liked this preview",5
"Product is good. But after 2months of purchase my monitor is showing vertical green line at right side. And I have to go to service center too soon. And they told they replace panel, whether I don't know they replaced panel or not. Then they called me after 3 days to take my monitor. And the problem was solved. And again after 3 months I faced same problem and took to service center they are simply saying water damage. And this won't come under warranty. And they showing only photo of monitor panel which is good. And they are telling they'll charge for that. And I never wiped my monitor with dry or wet cloth then how could this happen. And I even know that's not water damage. They simply want to charge money from me. And I'm never gonna buy any lg products anymore.one of the worst customer center is lg. Its better to go with dell monitors",1

3)Gaming performance quite looks like a charm that's what I can say right now after 9 days of usage. I will highly recommend to buy this product from amazon and I'm sure it will win your heart too ‚ô•Ô∏è

"the color quality is not up to the mark especially blak color is very poor in screen -screen shows grey color which is bit disappointing after spending double money on IPS technology.
Pros-1.average power consumption is about 14 W which is good
2.stand and look is good
3. reading profile settings is available with pc software which is easily manageable.

cons- 1.in built picture control is very bright and flickering you need to set colors and display settings from PC
2.IPS panel quality is not up to the mark the contrast ratio is poor and black color is dull in screen, which is most important factor of Panel in order to enjoy perfect viewing experience.
3 default brightness level of monitor is very high recommended to adjust it with in built graphic software of PC.",1
The very first thing I loved about this monitor is that its color calibrated. Not many monitors are. The first monitor I received took a beating during shipping and had a horrible backlight bleed. The second one was good and has no backlight bleed issues. The display quality is fantastic. The color is uniform and there is no flicker. There is a bit of IPS glow just like any other IPS panel. Navigation using the joystick is a breeze. I paired it up with my PS4 and everything has been smooth sailing. Just remember that if you notice backlight bleed after buying this monitor get a replacement asap. No one is mentioning about backlight bleed here and just accepting it as if it's a common defect.,5
"So the monitor stop working after 2 days of use , it was good until 2days but after that it become a trash

So I got a replacement for the monitor later
Guess what
It's was not working either

And now I got a another replacement
It was working but the quality was so much disappointing after 3 days the colour of screen become more pink , so I adjusted it by reducing the red colour in rgb but still it was not a good experience

The Amazon services suck
I really wanted a refund I don't got it

Tip: for buying monitor
Don't get lured to free sync monitor if it's only 60hz monitor

For gaming look for High hz rate monitor instead of type of panel
Usually go for the tn panel it's cheaper and have high frame rate and more fps
For gaming fps is more important than viewing angle, color and contrast
60hz monitor are not suitable for high end games go for a 120 or 144hz but don't buy that if you don't have a proper graphic card

Buy a ips panel only if you are going to watch too many videos but not for gaming unless you have a really enormous budget

Va panel is a compromising option between ips and TN panel",1
"<<dishonest Seller/LG>> THEY ARE SENDING RENEWED PRODUCT AT NEW BUYING.
I'm saying this because the display panel (i.e. LCD panel) changed to lower quality panel. At the display resolution 1920 X 1080 @ 75 Hz the blue color (color code #0078d7) looks pixelated and if the refresh rate is reduce to 60 Hz this problem almost gone. This thing happen when the panel mismatched with the controlled board.
I asked to monitor technicians and other who also repair monitors, they have same opinion.

I saw this monitor at our local computer shop and my friends also buy this same model from local shop. But the monitors from local shop has a grate picture quality and less back-light bleeding (barely noticeable ). And no pixelated blue color.

There is no option for No Star rating, so I've to given one Star.

I DON'T RECOMMENDED THIS MONITOR FOR GAMING. Because the response time is about 10ms on normal settings.
About 5ms is possible by turning on the faster mode but there is too much inverse ghosting. And that will be a bad experience of gaming.
Also beware of LG service at Westbengal region. According to their warranty policy the product can't be replaced only repaired. And the service person can't do anything except changing the service date.

(In my case I called for the upper bar glowing problem but the service person, instead of coming to my house he solved the problem by himself. Yes , the person send a problem solved massage to LG against my complained without coming to my house, without seeing the problem with monitor. That was his supper power)",1
"Video watching is very impressive and it wont disappoint movie lovers. It can be also useful to beginner level editors. Setting up the black stabilizer well can help the editors. It has very good view angle at the same time. It provides flawless gaming experience as a monitor made for gamers.
Screen split feature is included in the on screen control. You can split the screen and assign different tasks on those. You can choose between many layouts, it can be life saver for web developers and few other professionals. While multitasking you can open PIP and play your favorite media in any part of the screen. Overall the on screen software is very simple to use while very useful. t performed exceptionally well compared to its budget. i will recommend LG22MP68VQ-P monitor for gamers, photo and video editors, web developers and professionals specially for those who are looking for a good monitor and tight on budget.",5
"I expected it to be good.. But when it came, I opened it and plugged it in.. then I was just delighted with happiness..

Believe me it's the best panel under 10k budget.. Many of friends have different types of monitors .. but when it comes to picture quality.. This one is at the top of the list ..

The color reproductions are outstanding..
75hz , free sync , alsmost borderless display and most importantly IPS panel and yes the best IPS panel in the segment..

No bleeding issue..
I didn't notice IPS glow..

Blacks are pure blacks..

But only minimal problem is that it can not be tilted backward..

Don't be panic going through negative reviews.. I will give it 10/10 on the price",5
"Very good for the price range I got this one for 6400RS in great Indian festival sale. Very good for development purpose. Matt finish is good, not recommended for photo editing",5
"Monitor is good but it's software doesn't work in windows environment when connected with VGA cable, need to check with HDMI cable
Software works perfectly in Macbook when connected with HDMI cable
Appears like technically VGA cable doesn't support/provide two way communication

Sometimes when I remove macbook from HDMI and connect windows laptop with VGA cable then it does not recognize input signal and need to manually select input device.",4
"INTRODUCTION :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::
If you are looking for a great monitor, your search has ended. Without a doubt, it is the best budget gaming monitor . It is also the best monitor for video editing, movie watching and Internet browsing under 10,000 Rupees. And I will also try to explain, why it is better than its competitors, the Dell S2216H and HP 22ES, which are also awesome monitors under 10,000.

WHY THIS MONITOR IS INTERESTING :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Under the budget of 10,000,

a) It is among the very few monitors which are :

* 1) 21.5 inch (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, Benq RL2240HE, Samsung LS22E310HY/XL, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),
* 2) Full HD(Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),
* 3) IPS (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES,LG 22MP58VQ),
* 4) Matte screen with IPS panel (LG 22MP58VQ and Samsung LS19F350HNWXXL(Glossy with PLS panel) ) (others have either glossy screen with IPS panel or matte screen with VA or TN panel)

b) And is the only one which has :

* 1) Free-sync technology,
* 2) 75 Hz refresh rate(All other have 60 HZ)

Please write in comments, if I am missing any monitor in the above list, so that others can read it.

ABOUT BRAND :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::
LG makes some awesome products and they keeps providing cutting edge technology in its monitors. No wonder, we see them so much on youtube and other websites.

BASIC INFORMATION :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I will try to explain what these terms mean in brackets after the specifications.

* Size 55.88cm (22)
* Panel Type IPS (Best panel type for color reproduction)
* Color Gamut (CIE1976) 72% (Color gamut refers to the various levels of colors that can potentially be displayed by a device.)
* sRGB Coverage 86.1% (This is most common color gamut. Other are Adobe RGB and Photoshop RGB)
* Color Depth (Num of Colors) 16.7M colors (Most common color depth. 10 and 12 bit color depth is for serious graphic designers)
* Pixel Pitch (mm) 0.2915*0.2915 (Distance between centre of pixels to other centre of pixel. Lower the distance, sharper the image )
* Resolution 1920 x 1080
* Brightness(Typ.) 250cd/m2 (It's ok. Many other monitors offer the same brightness)
* Contrast Ratio(Original) 1000:1 (Here VA panels are better, which offer better contrast ratios of 3000:1 like Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM. Better contrast ratio means deeper blacks. But for IPS 1000:1 contrast ratio is common.)
* (DFC) Mega (LG's DFC is a meaningless number. Dynamic contrast means nothing, it's marketing jargon.)
* (GTG) 5ms (Its not great, but its good for gaming. For awesome 1 ms response time look at TN panels like Benq RL2240HE)
* Viewing Angle(CR‚â•10) 178/178 (One of the strong points of IPS panels is great viewing angles. No color distortion even if you look from very side)
* Surface Treatment Anti-Glare,3H (Matte screen is a must have, if you have lot of light in your room)
* Display interfaces D-Sub(VGA), DVI-D, HDMI (Many others have only two of these three display interfaces)
* Audio output Headphone Out (Audio quality was not good, and why would anyone connect headphones to monitors instead of their PCs)
* Maximum Power Consumption 17.6W
* Sleep Mode Power consumption Under 0.3W

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION :
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

* Also comes with cable holder, which is a detachable plastic part, that comes separately with the monitor and attaches itself to back of stand, and manages cables, so that you cannot see cables from front. It keeps things neat and managed.
* It is VESA mount compatible. Many budget monitors are not VESA mount compatible.
* Comes pre caliberated. Not many do. You get a printed 'color calibration factory report' with monitor inside box. You don't need to adjust anything by going into menu, if you don't want.
* Not all IPS are good but this really is and shows a lot better image than TN panels.
* You see sharper image on 22 inch 1080p screen, than 24 or 27 inch 1080p screen. As all three screens have same number of pixels, smaller size will have more pixel per inch than bigger screens.

BONUS INFORMATION :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I am really enjoying this monitor. If you like to have lots of features at low price and still want good quality product, this monitor is for you. Honestly I am waiting to see which monitor will come to dethrone this one, as the best budget monitor. I mean which monitor will be able to add more features than this one without increasing the price and still maintaining the quality.

I have many stories to tell, about my experience with this monitor. How I connected this with different PCs and laptops and how it interacted differently on them. Not going to bore you guys with details but a word of advice try to use this monitor over HDMI, as it works better and adds feature instead of VGA.

You also get OnScreen Control Software with this monitor, which I liked. Its simple to use. You don't have to control monitor settings from menu by using the joystick but you can do it from this monitor using your mouse easily. It lets you add display presets to different applications. And the presets will change automatically, when you switch to different applications. For example; if I add Reader preset to Microsoft Word and Cinema preset to VLC player, the brightness and contrast will go down whenever I switch to Word and will go up, whenever I switch to VLC.
You can also use screen split feature with one click from it. Screen splitting is that you can split your screen and look at two, three or four windows at a time on your screen. For example; I can look at chrome and word, side by side and I will not have to switch between them again and again, if I am doing work which needs both of these applications. Although, Windows 10 and some other free softwares like WinSplit and GridVista,offer split screen feature, but I liked this software. It's easy.

Also the main thing. It really shows sharp image quality. Color and contrast are fantastic.

THE STAND OUT FEATURES OF THIS MONITOR:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
As mentioned above, it is the only Free-sync monitor available under Rs 10,000.
In short, Free-sync technology allows the monitor's refresh rate to continuously adapt with respect to graphic card's frame rate. So, in a instance if your graphic card was generating 48 frames per second, your monitor will adapt to show 48 frames per second. All other monitors are fixed at 60 Hz or you can say that they are fixed to show 60 frames per second.

Now the question is why your monitor needs to adapt according to graphic card. Because it solves two problems which are,

1) tearing, when frames per second generated by your graphic card are more than 60Hz(or what monitor can output)

2) stuttering, which is generated to solve the problem of tearing by using Vertial sync technology (V-sync)

Watch some youtube videos to understand better about Free-sync. Without watching these videos, you will not understand tearing and stuttering. And without understand them, you will not understand the need of Free-sync.

Some basic things about Free-sync :

1) You will need a AMD graphic card for taking benefits of Free-sync. Because Free-sync is a AMD technology. NVidea has similar technology with name G-sync. But G-sync monitors are very costly in comparison to Free-sync monitors. And I am assured that they will not be available under Rs 10,000 for a long long time.

2) You unlock 75Hz refresh rate when you unable Free-sync.

THE PEOPLE IT WILL BENEFIT MOST :
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Gamers (even with Nvidea graphic card, as they also get 75Hz), Video editors and designers (as colors are important for them, which they cannot get on TN and VA panels) and any casual user(who simply uses computer for using mails and watch youtube videos) will benefit from this monitor.
Laptop owners who want a bigger 22 inch and higher 1080 resolution matte screen in comparison to their mostly smaller 14 inch and lower 768 resolution glossy screen.

BEST PLACE TO BUY FROM:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Buy it from amazon, because many old units come with VGA cable. And here you get new manufactured units with HDMI cable. I received such a new unit that it was manufactured on 25th April in China and I was using it on 4 th June. Approximately 1 month after it was made. Quality of HDMI cable is good.

PROS :
::::::::::

* 1) Free-sync
* 2) Anti glare IPS screen
* 3) 75 Hz refresh rate
* 4) Crisp image quality
* 4) Black stabilizers, for adjusting screen's gamma curve, which helps in seeing dark areas of games easily.
* 5) Awesome Onscreen Control Software
* 6) Best budget gaming monitor

CONS :
:::::::::::

* 1) Bezels are not as thin as many say.
* 2) Stand can only tilt, has no height adjustment or rotation. And also wobbles.
* 3) Only one HDMI.
* 4) Shows some IPS glow.
* 5) Glossy plastic back and stand.
* 6) Because of its popularity, it might not be available or sellers might increase their prices in future.
* 7) No speakers

ALTERNATIVES :
::::::::::::::::::::::::
If you are not interested in many of the features present in this monitor you can also opt for Dell S2216H, LG 22MP58VQ and HP 22ES. Which sometimes go down in price. But HP22ES has slow response time of 14ms (GTG).

CONCLUSION :
::::::::::::::::::::::
I didn't expected something like this will ever come under the price of 10,000. But it did. It's undoubtedly the best budget gaming monitor around the world.",5
"It's great for gaming as well as watching media.. It's a great entertainment device..All u need is speakers when watching movies and u are all set..great response time, colour production and picture quality.. The bezeless design makes it stand out from it's competitors..",5
"The monitor is very nice overall with a matte finish and 3 side narrow bezel. Excellent product if you want to mount 2 next to each other.

I upgraded from an old LG monitor which was VESA mounted to the wall and was hoping put this in instead, first it did not come with the screws and the ones from the old monitor would not work (too long) and second you need to leave about 3 inches between the back of the monitor and the wall (so only a swivel type VESA stand will work).

Second problem is the handling of low resolution video (480p) and below. My earlier 19 inch monitor would handle 480p video quite well and the same looks extremely grainy on this 22 inch monitor. Don't know what is causing this but since I only changed the monitors and nothing else, I assume it is the monitor.",3
"Bought it for 7,999/- including cashback and all

Bringhtness control & contrast control is just perfect.
Colors look quiet well.

Blacks are very clear in movies and games.
No need to change settings for CSGO.

Reader mode is also good but i just change contrast and brightness to suit me.
Viewing angles are good
That cable holder is very useful.
And color calibration is seems good to me.

Edit: cable holder is not that sturdy,
Have some driver issues, screen tearing while playing videos and games at 60fps of higher",4
"One of the best monitor you can get under 10k
I got it under Rs 8999 so it was a great deal
Pros :
Matt finish no reflection
Very slim bezels
Easy assembly
You can adjust it vertical
Cons :
It requires drivers to be installed no plug and play.
There was no amazon cardboard box the bill was pastes on the box of lg in which the monitor came and the serial number is not readable.

But you can easily find them on lg product website under support section
I'm currently using it with my laptop and it is a big upgrade from it's small 15.6 inch screen and 720p resolution",5
"Been using this monitor for over 6 months and I think it was the best in it‚Äôs category.

For Gaming: Great @ 60 Hz, Bad because I was getting another monitor by LG which was supporting 75 Hz. But again the Gaming Monitor by LG had so many issues like dead pixels, glare and etc.

In short this monitor is okay if you own a GTX 1050 Ti or lower since most of the games run @ 60FPS with that card. Get a 144 Hz monitor with a GTX 1060 or higher.

For working: Perfect, no issues at all. No flickering, no dead pixels, work non stop without any annoyance.

I‚Äôd give it a 8.5/10

I just removed a few points because the swivel is not actually a swivel, integrated speakers would‚Äôve been amazing.

Please click helpful if you liked my review :)",5
"I bought this monitor for my PS4 console. The picture quality produced by the monitor is amazing as it has IPS panel. The display is also anti-glare with mate finish.
It has only 1 HDMI port,1 VGA port and 1 DVI port.And also 1 aux port for audio.",4
"Monitor stand poorly designed with forward tilt, little jerk and monitor fell flat on the front panel, screen damaged is damaged and gone forever..thin bezel is not good for strength of the panel..I only buy Dell monitors which are robust, went for this seeing the review.
Even display quality is not that great, too bright. May be good for games but not for regular viewing.",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I just got this monitor 3 to 4 days ago... And today i just set up my new system, and npw all of a sudden a red horizontal start to blink on the bottom area of the screen.. Near the windows search bar which is very annoying.. Totally going for a replacement.. Didn't expect fomrom LG. Dissapointed..",1
"I gave 2 star Just because of Vertical Red line on the screen, otherwise, its worth to buy under 10K.

I received my order on 2.9.2019, unfortunately there's some problem in the screen.

I think it need to install Monitor driver. after installing monitor driver still having the same problem.. i change the cables, still its not working.. So, i ask for replacement.",2
"This monitor is one of the most recommended for those who want a good quality gaming/multimedia monitor at a budget price. It has Freesync so when paired with an AMD GPU you get stutter free gaming. IPS panels are gorgeous and visuals look stunning. Bezels are very thin and the anti glare coating is a nice addition

Cons:
1. No Display Port (So no Freesync via Nvidia cards)
2. No height adjustable but supports VEGA mounts",5
"Hi,

They say multi-screen display but this is not active with this product. My need was that but after observing its not supported its dis-appointing and but adv says it on amazon page....
Like this many other features are missing. Please be careful on your needs on this costly monitor of 8,899.00Rs.

Also, as per description they say ""1 Headphone Port"" which is not true. Please correct it amazon.

no usb port very big disappointment at this price.

Thanks",2
"Received a old manufactured product,the monitor was manufactured and imported in the year 2013..
initiated return let see what happens next..",1
"Great monitor for the PC. Full HD, multiple inputs.
It has a 3.5 mm jack audio output which will work only in case HDMI input is connected.
Was able to connect to a set up box via HDMI cable and it converted as a TV and used headphones for audio.
After a long research was confused between Dell S2240L which is best in 21.5 inch segment and LG22MP58 , chose lg because of 3.5 mm jack and its 2k cheaper.",5
"This an excellent monitor, recommended buy.
I am using it with my laptop and not tried for gaming.
So far it gives very good picture quality, brightness, contrast and all.
Anti glare is great, works well on most of the conditions
Cute look with 3 side thin bezels.
Good for watching movies.
Haven't tried gaming, so I cant say about it.
Thanks to the great and efficient delivery from Amazon",5

 Price Paid: Rs. 7000
Seller: https://amzn.to/2Is7kBc

Pros
- FULL HD IPS LED Monitor with anti-glare finish.
- Good picture quality with accurate colors. Has very high brightness, range from 0 to 100. Presently I have set both brightness and contrast at level 0, and its still bright.
- The 22-inch size doesn't feel very big, feels slightly bigger than 18.5 inch monitor.
- Very sleek and stylish looking with minimal bezels.
- Wall mounting option is provided.
- The monitor weighs just 4 Kgs.
- The monitor is powered by 19V adapter, not direct AC supply, which is better.
- It has many ports, 1 HDMI port, 1 DVI port, and 1 VGA port. For audio out, it has headphone jack. You can also connect a 2nd HDMI cable to the DVI port using an HDMI to DVI adapter.
- The monitor has only 1 switch (joystick), which is under the LG logo.
- Power consumption around 15 Watts.

Cons:
- Increases the CPU running temperature considerably unless you have the latest PC. I had a 720p monitor earlier and CPU temperature was much lower.
- Glossy finish, though not a bad thing, it can easily get scratches and fingerprints.
- Stand is not very stable, can topple forward easily.

Make sure you buy from an amazon approved seller: https://amzn.to/2Is7kBc",5
"It is magical. It is a very bright and extra smooth display. I am using it without Freesync enabled, and the 1080p is absolutely the best. It took me a while transitioning from a 4:3 monitor to a 16:9 aspect ratio, but this is the perfect workable resolution. 4k monitors are stupid for a small screen. You will need at the very VERY least 32 inches to make sense of 4k resolution, otherwise the icons, the display is cringe.

Everyone knows about the LED quality of LG, it is mesmerizing. The IPS panel is absolutely bright and it is perfect for watching movies, browsing social media, checking email and the common day-to-day tasks. The blacks aren't as inky, but it is as good as an IPS panel can get at this price point, but the WHITES are absolutely LIT AF. You can't expect great gaming performance with mediocre frame rate, as it is not made for the AAA titles; but if you're a fan of the classics like I am, you would absolutely love gaming with this monitor.

It doesn't cover much of the Colour Gamut, but it will be fine for an entry-level or first time creative professionals. If you're someone who work with the visuals ie if you are a Graphic Designer, Video Editor or an entry-level intern on a very VERY tight budget, you can't get wrong with this.

If you're a casual PC user or a school/college student, you don't need to look anywhere else Simply CLICK THE BUY BUTTON. Anything else will be just overkill.",5
"At this price, I dont expect anything more and overall the quality isn't bad. The contract and white balance could be better, but I have connected my MacBook and its stupid to compare a screen on a 1 lakh rs device to a 10k monitor. But, its quite light, which may seem cool, but honestly its not like we need to move it around much. The problem with it being so lightweight is that if you use this on a glass table then the vibrations are going to make the monitor wobble. I have to stabilize it by putting a phone box under the screen so it reduces the wobbling, but it still happens.",3
"Great budget monitor with above average color reproduction and a 75Hz refresh rate. For those wondering, the 15 Hz does make a visible difference. Moreover if you intend to also use the monitor for video and photo editing the ips panel thats been factory calibrated works really well unlike other ‚Äúgaming‚Äù monitors that sacrifice picture quality for higher refresh rates and slower response times",5
"Monitor is very good and sharp picture quality. IPS Panel. Crisp image. Multiple onscreen features available (if you install OnScreen Control software). Multiple modes are available (reading mode, cinema mode, image mode, custom mode etc.). Picture in picture option is excellent. Free sync available if you use with AMD gpu. I faced a problem to find out the power on/off button. It took around 15 minutes to find it out. Then reading the user manual (available in the CD) I finally found out the power on/off button. Very easy to install, just like plug and play. This is not a bezel less monitor. I am satisfied with this product and service also. If you are looking for a pc monitor and your budget is Rs.10,000/-, then this would be a good choice. So I will give it 5-stars.",5
"Awesome Product! Got it for 6400 INR. Best Deal ever and this is The best Budget Gaming Monitor You Will Ever Get.
Paired it with RX570 8GB DDR5 With FREESYNC, If you never experience this Adaptive Sync before, Try it, Pair it with AMD card and boom, Best Gaming Experience Ever. And yes its anti glare, Modern looking, Fast in response, And Mainly Color Production is Awesome. Go For it & look For Offers.",5
"There are many reviews already written about this monitor. I won't repeat the same things.

I would like to highlight the below points.

1.It supports AMD FreeSync but it also works with NVIDIA Gsync. Just make sure you have the latest graphic driver installed from NVIDIA. Then in NVIDIA Global settings you need to select the VSYNC option as fast.

2. Combined with AMD Ryzen 5 3600, GTX 1660 6GB DDR6 Graphics and Corsiar 3000mhz 16GB DDR4 RAM with GSync I get more than 80 FPS on Ultra settings at 1080p in Games like The WItcher 3, Hitman 2, Batman Arkham Knight.......planning to test it with more latest games like Red Dead Redemption 2.

Cons: I found only one. You will need to calibrate the screen color. It had a little greenish tone with default settings (Your experience might be different depending on your configuration).
But not a big thing, understanding the monitor controls and adjusting the screen setting took me around 5 minutes.

Overall Great Performance Monitor for gaming. If you are on tight budget go with it !!

BTW I bought it for 8499, the price is now increase to 10k. Don't know why.",5
"This is the best monitor under 9k..just close your eyes and buy
Dont go for for 24 inch..many users notice led bleeding issue .
Freesync enabled..so you dont have to worry about tearing issue for gaming..for nvidia users they will get native 75hz
Matte finished which i personally prefer
Display quality is awesome üòçüòç",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I am not giving a review about pictures quality, features..... I will tell you about build quality.......... I used this monitor as my car window it really act as a bullet proof window ..... through this I can watch movies while driving. I have connected this monitor with my alto car super-charger, and a mobile-dish antenna.

It also has Durga IPS Pannel with anti-flicker.

And also supports AMD Free Sync which is not free it cost you about 8800rs

One day I have tested its build quality it was really an awesome experience. I throw it from my 3rd floor and after that...... It was working fine without a single scratch.
But it starts making sounds like vrrroommm vrrroommm.

You can also use this monitor as Dosa Cooking Vessel because it is really large in size. Before using it as a Dosa Vessel make sure that your heater or gas or something else have to reach atlest 69k degree celsius that's it. Now you can cook your Dosa

Best monitor is this budget.
Must buy",5
"It is an excellent price to performance ratio monitor. I would even go around saying this the best monitor under 10k even though it's 2 year old model.
Pros:
- Brilliant viewing angles
-perfect DPI for the size of 21.5 and 1080p res
- 75hz outof the box
- freesync!!
-perfect picture quality
- factory colour calibrated. Keeps a fair balance for content viewing and editing work
- comes with HDMI cable

Cons
- Glossy finish
- **important note: it doesnt have display port so you can't use a Nvidia card to use gsync
- no height adjustment",5
"I'm a big fan of LG products due to their quality. However found this monitor quite average in terms of display quality especially while watching 360p/480p videos on youtube. My old LG LCD monitor was delivering even better display for all types of videos. Not sure if this is how all IPS monitor renders the output or I need to change any settings. This review is based on 1 week of use. Will explore more & update .

One can even consider buying 24 inch version of LG IPS which comes Rs. 8700 in local store. Only con is , it will not be bazel less, stand & overall look is ordinary but if you want to watch movies from little far distance like from bed/coach , I would suggest to go for 24 inch ignoring looks.",3
"My rating is only to ascertain the fact that its a monitor that works . But, major dissapointed when I am spending above 8k on a product recommended on Amazon is that the monitor,its stand & the charger arrived in the package . NO VGA/HDMI cable . Amazon should out right ban these dealers who thrive on Consumer's money. Since I had to make it work, I bought the VGA& HDMI cable separately . I have complained about the Dealer and Amazon has not taken any action. Lastly , the monitor just powers on and off, you cannot change the Picture Mode,Input or go to Menu as displays on the monitor screen when you press the power button. But its India , who listens to Consumers ?
Sub standard product. If you are a buyer lookimg for a good monitor, no matter what rating this product has, go for a cheaper option as you may need to purchase the cables separately .",1
"IPS works great according to the price! Value for money IPS upgrade for graphic designers and photographers if you are using TN panel. You can't work on the TN panels after using IPS :)
The biggest advantage is the levels of whites and darks. For example you can distinguish between 100% white and 99% white on IPS, which is impossible on TN. IPS is a must have for UI Designers.",5
Definitely on of the best budget monitor out there with 75hz refresh rate and full hd display. It has awesome ips panel that reproduce colors just about natural. viewing angles are very good. But when you view from angle color tends to fade a little. Though every display panel has this problem but its noticeable. Black is not fully black. You will find the led tint quite annoying in videos or gaming when scene is dark. But considering the price point its okay. I had to tinker around with the settings a bit to get the right color and brightness of my liking. The factory setup is very bright and vibrant that is not really suited for close viewing. Your eyes will feel the stress in less than an hour. but overall after a little bit of changing in settings this monitor will not disappoint you...So go for it..,4
Third class service & very arrogant customer service. I got defective monitor & it's shows 7 days replacement but when I try to do it no option showing & customer representative says it's can't be returned or replaced. Better to buy from flipkart,1
"I primarily bough this monitor for daily office work and light gaming( primarily CS ). It has now been a month since use and this fits perfectly well or the use. However, long continous usage causes eye strain

Pros:
- Wide monitor for daily use
- Preset picture setting for comfortable vision
- power saver mode to which puts screen to sleep if no signal is detected.

Cons:
- long continous usage causes eye strain even in reader mode but this may vary from person to person. One should take appropriate breaks between screen sessions",5
"While this might be the amazons choice based on purchase, do not buy this monitor - colours are not accurate and text is not sharp - if you compare the text displayed on your laptop with this monitor, you can see the difference. In spite of doing calibration using windows, things did not change.

As for colours, they are completely off and there are no options like TV to adjust anything much from the device. As for LG provided software, that is not of any good",1
"I have been a proud owner of the Dell S2240L monitor https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B009MXKJ2A for over 5 years. I had bought that Dell monitor way back during January 2015. But this L‚àôG‚àô monitor (22MP68VQ) which I recently purchased during March 2020 {and it was delivered at my residence today itself} appears to be a lot worse than that Dell S2240L monitor. I can observe a yellowish tinge on the Right Half of this L‚àôG‚àô 22MP68VQ monitor especially whilst surfing the internet on white-coloured backgrounds\interfaces. And while playing videos, the black colour [as and when applicable; whenever or whereever it is present] towards the Left Half of the screen seems to be of dull/diluted black colour whereas the black colour [as and when present; whereever present] towards the Right Half seems to be of rich/proper black colour. The brightness is also automatically changing without any doing of mine. The stand is also far worse than what the stand\support of my previous Dell monitor used to be.",3
"Product ia good but it has all ports vertical so cables touch to wall. Stand is fashionable but not strong enough.

Saller is not providing bill and warranty card with stamp here. I want to return this product but believe in LG company and hoping that nothing will not be wrong with this product in 3years so that i am keeping this.
Amazon should take action against saller for this major mistake.",2
"For the price, this is an amazing deal. Got it on sale for ‚Çπ7k and I'm very happy with it. It is quite bright, so much so that i barely use it over 80% brightness. The thin bezels give it a very modern look which is awesome. It is good for content consumption, but don't expect to be doing colour accurate editing on this. This monitor is a great all rounder Full HD package.

I gave it a 4 star for the gaming criteria since this monitor isn't built for gaming exactly and it is not going to push anything above 1080p 60FPS because well, those are the specs lol.

The only thing I didn't particularly like about it is the included stand, but this monitor is also VESA compatible so atleast you're not limited to that particular stand, and you can use this monitor in a dual (or more) screen setup however you want. All in all, this is a great purchase and I would definitely recommend it.",5
"I am now using this monitor for the last 4 days and most of the time playing games and watching movies.The picture quality is superb and colour balance is awesome.This monitor is perfect for gaming.One thing I also want to inform that those who are trying to use this monitor with win 7 or win 8 64bit,just connect the monitor but 'Dont install 'the driver bcoz the driver is designed for win10.So there will be serious conflict between graphics driver and monitor driver which might cause any game to stop working properly.But with the inbuilt motherboard driver and operating os(win 7 or win 8 64 bit) the monitor is very very very good and will work perfectly.The audio port is not working with D-sub connection,it might work with HDMI but as I already use 5.1 sound system separately so this is not a big deal for me.",5
"Excellent picture quality with easy settings. If you are a big fan of movies, than your search ends here. Better than Dell & hp. International looks & features makes it more attractive. Games image resolution wise, its best from others.

Your HDMI cable is in inside the box with manual book. Price has gone up little because of GST issues but still its a best choice.",5
"This is my second purchase (14th Jun 2021) i.e. in 10 months. I had bought it earlier in Aug 2020 after reading the reviews and compared it with Benq GW2283 , & LG 22MK600M (latest i.e. 2018 model).

In terms of usability features are more in this e.g. display bit depth of 8 bits, multi connectivity options (VGA, HDMI, DVI, Audio Out Ports), 4 split screen functionality, 178 degree viewing angle etc.

Do note that the split screen functionality being LG software driven the multi sub screens cannot be detected in the VDI/Horizon clients (corporate software for remote access). But for home use it's a good feature as you can open reference sites, documents in the split windows within the screen to refer to while working on your primary laptop screen.

Multi ports make sense e.g. as in my T430 laptop I have a display port, and DVI port, there is no HDMI. So with display port adaptor I am able to connect to this monitor using HDMI cable and while other with DVI and end result I have two screens connected to the laptop

Quite happy with the purchase.",5
"This LG monitor is wonderful.
I'm using it for office work.

Likes:
- Image quality (disable the superfine resolution to get smooth fonts)
- Borderless compact design
- value for money

Dis-likes:
- no HDMI CEC, so I have to turn on/off the monitor separately from the PC.
- no built in speakers",4
"movies look amazing!
i re-watching all my fav movies again because they look so good on this. ( i had an old tn panel screen)

"As described - very crisp display, doesnt glare. If there is direct light falling on it then yes you will need to readjust but otherwise fantastic.

Did not use for games so not sure about that.

The on/off button is in a little secretive place which helps maintain its asthetics but not too convenient to reach. I do not turn it on/off often since the computer shuts down and takes it to standby, so works for me.

Overall, great buy - nothing to regret.",5
"This is a very nice monitor for its price point. at just over 8K (10+k now), this is an excellent buy. The pictures are not very sharp but are crisp enough for everyday use. The colours are not vibrant or true colours but they are not bad at all. I'd say good to very good, if not excellent. Text and font are crisp and not very sharp. The panel and switches feel cheap and flimsy but it works without problems.

The one issue with this monitor is the stand. As you type, with the slightest shake of table, the monitor keeps shaking up. The stand isn't study or rigid to hold the monitor firmly when the table moves (I have a height adjustable table)

The monitor is wall mountable, has only one HDMI port and also supports VGA. It even has audio output (not USB). Overall a good buy for this price point (8K) and not 10.5K at what it is now at the time of writing this review. In two days they hiked the price by 2000 rupees!",4
"Monitor is great for usual Office tasks. Color accuracy is questionable so not ideal for video or photo editing type of jobs or gaming. For standard office jobs this is a great monitor for the price. Came in original packaging with CD to load the software.

My concern is on build quality, after 3 months a crack has appeared at the rear. Monitor is still working great.",4
"It's picture quality was very awesome. The main thing I liked most is anti glare option which makes this monitor as perfect. Mostly I enjoying viewing cinemas in monitor. So I choose this which completely satisfy my requirements. It's easy to assemble and ready to use. It's 22"" display play most significant role with this budget. I really satisfying enjoying viewing cinemas in this monitor. And also I am a fan LG which has a famous and quality brand in all products.. A great expections is I had it in during delivery time that is package type and package quality because we are eagerly waiting to receive a product if any damages happens, then it. Will be a most sad situation. In this I m really thanks to Amazon to deliver a wonderful product with quality package and safe package.",5
"Clear and comfortable screen display. There is a button below the monitor screen which not only power on the display, but all display adjustments are done from this single button. Hope this button will not go faulty with frequent use. Multiple screen modes like reader modes and cinema etc.which adjusts screen color and brightness for the required mode accordingly.Power button light can be enabled or disabled.
Got for an total deal of abot 6300.

Overall good. Will update with more details later after few months usage.
Note:HDMI cable included in the package.",4
"Amazon India DID NOT allow to post my following authentic feedback and rejected on 26.08.2020, trying to post again now.

Dear All, I bought this product on 06.08.2020 (prime day sale) and same was delivered on 10.08.2020.

Am Not a pure techie btw, hence skipping technical aspects of review.. many others have detailed; let's take a cue from them.

BELIEVE ME NOT GIVING IMMEDIATE REVIEWS.

Writing only after 2 months of usage.. that too after expiry of Amazon returns date... so this is genuine.

I experienced following problems.. feel many others reading this would have experienced too.. till this moment of writing this review i find there are 3.8k buyers incl. me... so !.

1. Amazon IN says Included Components for this PC Monitor has "" Monitor, Stand, Power Cord, Connectivity Cables "" - however just received HDMI.. enquired with various stakeholders of team LG India for other cables - sorry only eerie silence received as revert despite escalation; felt no point coordinating with team LG.

If you enquire with Amazon IN, they too do not have this info, just would redirect us to LG. Even if you mention this to LG corporate marketing team, eerie silence would be received as revert.

2. My system configuration is Pentium dual core 2.6Ghz - 64 bit Win 7 Ultimate OS; using D-Sub port for CPU and monitor connectivity. Despite having this config; also compatible with LG Onscreen control dedicated software for its PC video monitors (as per LG India portal), still Onscreen did not work.

3. Spoke umpteen times to various stakeholders of team LG India (incl. Technical trainer and technical team troubleshooter) - sorry i was told this Video PC monitor can be used only for extended viewing say with Laptop - when probed why it was mentioned NO where in LG india (or) Amazon India portal in their product pages - the end result was i was asked to return the monitor for refunds... and a callback supposedly to be received did not happen in last 1.5 months.

4. I challenge most would disbelieve me with this kind of brand LG service; fine with it, as I have documentary proofs. I already wrote to regulatory bodies like NCH and noted it's not worth complaining as you donot receive support despite if you share umpteen proofs and updates... Only time waste !!!.

5. With Onscreen control absence.. am unable to use display Presets and VERY IMPORTANTLY Screen Split has not even worked in last 2 months as it is not available in physical menu. I could not even see now how screen split would be like in my present 22MP68VQ monitor despite 2 months passed.

6. I repeatedly get a command in PC during system boot that my video monitor is not set to 1920*1028.. this is despite we set the resolution rate to 1920*1028 in system.. pc monitor never adjusts to our resolution set on systems.. sadly this 1920*1028 is not available to be set in physical menu and onscreen software is the only go !.

7. I found a twitter user complaining about a LG TV/Monitor (made in China) product becoming defective in 2 years and was asking for replacement... As Country of Origin for this product is China - not sure how long will it sustain; though this product has 3 Year Warranty...

8. Am from Chennai and have in the last 2 months spoken over 2 hours with various stakeholders of LG India team and have sent umpteen mails still as of date even after 2 months only miscommunications, misguidance, contradictory assistance, NO timelines and eerie silence were received as revert from LG India team.

9. Even if you escalate to National consumer helpline, no use as LG does nothing in terms of service as one of its manager went to the extent of even suggested for returning to take refund instead of trouble shooting.

10. LG service engineer spent 1.5 hours trouble shooting the problem on 02.09.2020 and was NOT successful despite he said OSC is an open source application which would run on all OS.

11. The same service engineer called a week later and suggested to check with their inhouse CPU in my place, when we asked for resolution he proved a turncoat saying if it works with their cpu then my OS is an issue, reviewers could note the versions received from team LG India.

12. We wrote to their Senior management and corporate teams with all proofs still nothing happened in past 2 months.

13. Our complaint to NCH & MCA with umpteen proofs went in favour of LG as NCH asked us to approach NCDRC.

End result: if anyone believes brand LG being global their products and service levels would be appreciable, then think twice..

I own almost almost 60k worth of various consumer appliances of LG still I had to face this obnoxious music from LG team india and its local staffs.",1

Color - 5/5

MUST BUY FOR UNDER ‚Çπ10000",5
"Hello,
It's been about a year I bought this monitor. Overall it's okay product. All of sudden it has started showing a vertical line on the monitor. As the warranty is for 3 years, an the seller please let me know if this is covered under warranty?
Thanks & Regards,
--Vijay",3
The monitor stand is not firm one and very light weight. After receiving the product contacted Amazon to return it and to get another monitor with a good quality monitor stand. Amazon refused to EXchange it. As per theIR rule if you buy it then that all. Very disappointed. how one can see the quality of the product though a online image. Next time I should be very careful before buying any electronic product from Amazon.,1
"At first I didn't like the monitor coz it had backlight bleeding issues and also it had an dead pixel on right top corner, i was worried. After that I spoke with the customer care and they easily replaced the product, the second one came and I was fascinated that it didn't have any faults, the picture quality was great and it serves my purpose well. I do gaming casually not high but like moderately and watch movies and I also do designing using cad softwares so for all this the color reproduction is quite good and for @7k what can I expect more, completely satisfied with the product.

cons: texts are sometimes harder to read and for high end gaming go for better monitors.",5
"I was previously using LG LCD monitor 19.5 inch since last 7-8 yrs and it was still working except some issues on display which were not that quite visible while using bt still went ahead to upgrade myself with a new one. LG has seriously being the best in the market with this budget LED 22 inch display.

I got this in PRIME day sale for 6.5k with cashback, so it was a great deal for me, as its usually priced around 8500 in normal days.

PROS:-
1) Best Clarity with different modes
2) Perfect to watch movies on.
3) Bezeless display gives you more space.
4) Has HDMI and audio in connection too

CONS:-
1) The stand is bit wobbly if shaken the LED can fell flat on the screen so be careful about it.

This was my analysis after using it for a month and I am really happy with this :)",5
"I was in the market to get a monitor for my WFH purpose, to use as a primary monitor and close the laptop monitor.
I was surprised by the built quality, display quality and design. The design is what makes it stand out.The best part of the monitor was the toggle button/selector for the settings of the monitor...Its like the cursor we had in old blackberry phones(Don't exactly know what they are called :p)..
Now coming to display...I have placed it opposite to the window and with sun rays it's pretty much bright enough to work...
The height can not be adjusted but there is little scope of inclination adjustment that can be done.
I would buy the same monitor again when I go for a dual monitor setup.
P.S. -> I have been using this monitor for the past 6 months",5
Ordered on 28th april 2019 recieved today 1 april 2019 and have to say this is a very good looking and high performance machine...and have very less price than other monitor in the market...overall its very good product ...packaging was perfect ....no damage or scratch,5
"I'm reviewing after using the monitor for 2 months...it's really a good product....it has nice viewing angles.. IPS Display is added to its advantage But two things which I noticed is that the monitor stand is not sturdy...So the monitor shakes a little bit ....you have to be careful while placing the monitor and the second one is there is a 3mm gap between the screen and side panels on all the 4sides but this has got nothing to do with the performance of the monitor. If you are not worried about these two issues then you can go for this one...It will satisfy you in every way for like gaming, movies etc etc",4
"I use it for daily work, check emails, watch prime video or netflix video etc. the anti-glare panel is really nice and I enjoy it over my old dell monitor. color production is good with good picture quality. Just one thing I did n't like is the driver comes with a cd and I do not have a cd player. I used it for both my monitor and laptop as a secondary display and it looks better than my dell laptop screen.",5
"Good for work from home-office work

I got this to work with a Mac book and it works well. I didn't try out the multi screen feature (4 screens in 1).

The package also includes a HDMI cable and I bought another cable ( the product description didn't specify the type of cable provided ).

The monitor has an audio slot that you can connect to speakers if needed.

The only thing I would have liked in addition is a height adjustment , but that's not a big problem in my case. It might help to place this at a slightly higher plane than the height of the laptop / keyboard",5
"This is a great FHD monitor from LG at this price. I have purchased it at 9100‚Çπ. It has HDMI input with 75 Hz refresh rate. But for that it needs AMD Graphics card connected to it‚Äôs HDMI port.
Overall an amazing IPS LED monitor at an amazing price.",5
"The monitor is awesome. I use to do lot of Lightroom stuff, so perfect for my use. I do not do much gaming so cannot comment on that, but overall is good for viewing videos as well as photos. There are different modes and I am overall very satisfied with the product. I use it as my primary monitor. The viewing angles are also quite good, since this is an IPS display. I got it for RS 7369 in Diwali offer and also got another RS 740 discount for using Amazon Pay ICICI bank card, so overall an awesome deal for me.",5
"This is probably the best under 10000 monitor out there. 75hz refresh rate is quite good since this is not aimed for super high end gaming sets. Also the pictures are quite good and the IPS display is top notch. Even anti glare works fine. It's got a vesa wall mount but the stand it comes with feels weak as it wobbles if my desk is hit. Audio output isn't extraordinary but no one will wire up headphones to it anyways. A very good 1080p monitor with a pleasing look. Also , it has a number of modes and even 2 reader modes which is a lifesaver. The LG provided software can divide the screen upto 4 screens. It's got support for HDMI, VGA and display port.",5
"Ordered during the COVID19 period, product box barcode was tampered and seller has pasted its own information on the same.Monitor display worked good for 7-8 days and suddenly display went wrong, it started flickering and was not able to view anything as it became too dark and thin lines started showing up.

Returned Monitor though waiting for the refund.
Monitor display when working was good, purpose was to have a extra screen which worked for a short tenure.
UI menu is not too friendly and had to search in google for optimal setup for viewing, reader modes are not good.",1
I am writing this product on the day I received the product. I am using it with mac mini (2018) no issues. I have tested it for browsing and movies. I have not tested it for games as I am not into it. I really liked the reader mode and very wide range of adjustment features provided with the monitor. The button given for the feature adjustment however does not look long lasting. I have given four star because they could have given a button of better quality for adjustment. The clarity with mac mini is fantastic for 1080p and 720p. They additionally have 1920 x 1600 (very good for reading). The hdmi cable along with it is okay but I prefer my belkin cable which is more smooth in terms of plugging in or out with mac and monitor. Overall seems a nice monitor for the price let us now see how long it can perform at this rate.,4
"Likes:
The picture quality is very good. Would recommend for single player games. (Not for competitive games)
Dislikes:
Only 1 hdmi port.
Adapter's wire quality is so cheap.
Stand is not stable when trying to tilt monitor.
If u have budget of around 10000 go for lg24mk600m but if ur budget is max of 8000 go for this monitor.",4
"This product is amazing. I am using this product from last 3 months and this product didn't disappointed me till now.
But I recommend you to invest little bit more in monitor and prefer to buy Full hd or 4k quality monitor.
You might not be happy with graphics quality with this monitor.
Packing of product was also good.
Worth buying this prouduct.",5
"Nice monitor but lost a star because the ports at the back point outwards instead of downwards, so it really needs around 5 inches of space between the screen and the wall, especially if you plug a fire stick in there like I did. Also, does not support HDMI-CEC for automatic input selection, but the switch between inputs is fairly fast and easy.",4
"Supplier shipped product which was retuned by someone, the seal was broken, the packing was not as per company standard for monitor, the parts like stand, adapter were loose in box and not in there slots provided. this was not good experience at all with supplier, however Amazon customer care was up to the mark and listen to me and with provided details they triggered the replacement. once product is received I will revise this review/feedback,",1
"I have been using this monitor since 3 months. The monitor serves its purpose very well. It has adequate brightness and is color calibrated. The viewing angles are good almost 180 degrees as it is IPS display. Comes with 3 years of warranty. The only Con is the button and lack of USB input. If there was, i could have used it as wireless display. There is only one joystick like button which serves all purposes. The button could go bad very quickly on usage. LG provides an application to configure the settings which doesn't work at all. So you have to use the button for configuring monitor.",5
"This monitor supports only VGA cable. If I connect HDMI - Flickering starts and it will kill your patience. Even Lord Buddha will get angry, when this Monitor Flickers.

Initially I was using NVIDIA Geforce GT 710 2GB - Flickered
Then upgraded to NVIDIA Geforce GT 730 GDDR5 4GB - Flickered
Again I upgraded to NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1660 OC Super 6GB - Still Flickering

Please tell me, what will stop this stupid monitor from flickering?

Settings made
1. Free Sync - on
2. Super resolution - off
3. Fast Response - on
4. Black Stabilizer - 50%",1
"Suitable for AMD graphics Card user who wants to use free sync. Picture Quality is alright, Sometimes when on High brighness and high refresh rate panel gets heat up a little you can feel heat on the outside case, No protect whatsoever for eyes except MATTE FINISH which helps by not reflecting or refracting image or light falling on it. But in terms of eye protect It provided none. Causes Eye Strain in long Use. Affected my eye sight Have to use minimum powered glasses with Anti-Glare coating. Better Buy no power Anti-Glare glasses before start using it.
It was cheapest in the quality thats why I bought it because at first I needed it for occassion use. Better invest more money If you are gonna use it for long time or gaming, get some high range Product.",3
"I like everything about it. At this price point, the features offered make it excellent when it comes to value for money. But, what I did not like is the pathetic product design.
First of all the stand base is a light weight plastic, which is very fragile and barely manages the weight of monitor. It puts the monitor under unstable equilibrium. Meaning, a slight push and your monitor falls bam on the table!!

So, I had to buy a heavy stand separately. But what happened next left me wondering about how a company of stature like LG could approve such a product design. The base stand when pulled out leaves a stand neck attached to the bottom of the monitor. Now, this stand neck has been fastened on screws from inside of the back panel. That means, for me to be able to use my new stand, I need to disassemble the monitor first, unscrew the stand neck, assemble it back again and then mount it on my new stand or even on the wall for that matter.
I had to take my monitor to LG service center to get that neck removed.",3
In image product look like gud but aftr gt it that size and product are totaly different.. Am cancel the product but they are not take the product...customare care tolf electronic itms return option is nt there ..so totally 8000 waste...fraud,1
"This review is not even required understanding the fact that it's an LG panel for such a low price, the gaming on this is seriously an experience altogether. The picture clarity is top notch and staring at it for hours don't even hurt your eyes. It's only drawback is that it has only one HDMI output but that as well you can buy any cheap HDMI extension from the market and there you have it.
People planning to buy this do not hesitate, it's one hell of a monitor, you will not be able to do anything else once you buy this, you will be hooked up to it forever. I hardly write reviews but I was so impressed with this that I could not stop. Cheers!!",5
"Very Fantastic Monitor Cum TV. HD. Quality is so better then others, If any go for purchase can go no doughy. but thing is minus is no inbuilt speakers but any way best. Another thing is seller not supplied VGA cable in the box. Please i am requesting to seller if possible send me VGA cable to my delivery address . dew to monitor is good i dont like to return or replace the product now.",5
It's a good monitor for watching movies and playing some casual gaming. It's got some modes for reading and I find it very useful when reading some articles or programming. It's got AMD freesync so games look smooth. The refresh rate is decent at 75 Hz. It's a good mtilurpose monitor.,5
"The picture quality is sharp with thin bezels. This monitor is good for all purposes normal and gaming alike.
There is no problem with the display and the contrast, colours , modes etc can be customised.

The product comes only with an HDMI cable and VGA cable is not included. The odd thing is the design of the stand. It could have been better placed. Also this product can be wall mounted, but it does not come with a mount.",4
"Solved my purpose 99.9 %..

If anyone looking a monitor for Playing consoles please go for this product.
I was very confused that which monitor i should buy for playing ps4, after a 5 days of searching finally i desided to buy this one.. trust me guys a saw more then 20 monitors online and finally I selected this one..
I saw lots of negative and positive reviews but my opinion is 99.9 % ok..

Guys, dont look for inbuilt speakers in monitor as none of any monitor can give you a better sound like TV gives go for a good external speaker.. as i already have a ‚ÄòBOSE SOUND LINK SPEAKER‚Äô so it gives me a awesome sound quality.. thanks for the aux jack in monitor.
I have played games in this monitor for 6 hours continue and no eyes problem infact in my sony hd tv I face a problem sometimes in my eyes..

Thats all guys..

Go for it without any confusion.

Go for it...",5
"Though advertised as sRGB over 99% here, this monitor pales in comparison to my LG 25inch ultrawide which is also sRGB over 99%. Looking at the specs page on LG's site for this monitor, the color gamut is 72% of CIE1976 and not CIE1931 which is comparable to sRGB over 99%. Interestingly, the 23inch model does have the latter and will have better colors.

The monitor also has issue with 75Hz where you can see faint lines running through the image.",3
Initially I had given 5 stars. At first sight it was okey. But brightness was very high. I reduced the brightness. Still it is very much unpleasant to eyes. My eyes got irritated and burnt due to this monitor. After some months I got realized that it badly effected my eyes. This is my second LG IPS monitor. The first one also had the same problem. Now I realized that IPS panel is a big problem for eyes. I found myself comfortable when using TN Panel and VA panel monitors. Now I changed this monitor. It was really a night mare. Dont buy this.,1
"Perfect budget monitor. You get more for what you pay. Gaming is buttery smooth and AMD sync work perfectly. Nvidea card work on 60fps and does not feel any difference between the two (75fps & 60fps). I have my CPU with AMD card and my Laptop with Nvidia card and the monitor works on both with no notable differences or Lag during gameplay.
Good picture quality and matt screen makes this monitor a beast for budget guys and school gammers... There is a separate mode for movie/photo/reading/gaming which is absolutely insane. Just a few clicks and monitor adjusts its brightness and contrast according to the mode. It also adjust its brightness according to the content of display, the more white content will lower the brightness and darker content are displayed with higher brightness and it does this automatically all the time. You can blindly trust this beast for the price you pay!",5
"Not very impressed. I have connected it to my laptop and can find visible difference in its picture quality compared to laptop screen. Monitor has a little glowing edges (especially top bar), I had to replace the first delivery due to this but second one was also similar (though slightly less glow). It is made in china which is also causing some guilt in my heart (which is almost every monitor).",3
Good monitor. Support G-Sync over hdmi i played GTA V and there was no screen tearing. 75Hz refresh rate. Text is crisp and clear from 2ft distance. Colors are vibrant. Just consumes 10.5W in energy saving mode. HDMI cable is provided. No color bleeding. I‚Äôm happy with my purchase.,5
Please don't buy lg 22mp68vq because 1st time i got defective product which have dead pixel 1 coming on 3rd day and also so much bleeding on top and bottom. 2nd product comes with top left hand side bleeding only. But i accepted then after 15 days i realized that half side left is white but half right side is yellowish it's affect only on white background. Picture quality is average. Don't go with reviews also on youtube like IG that's why am regretting my purchase.,2
"Image quality is very good. However, for Retina Display Macbooks, the images on monitor are not Sharp if native resolution is kept for both displays. (Retina Displays are of higher resolution vis a vis HD resolutions of these Monitors).
With Windows laptops, the image quality is quite good and works very well.
Overall, Positive experience.",4
"This is one of the best budget monitors, trust me or not, it's really good. As a UI/UX Designer and a Programmer, I feel very good about this monitor. I also game on this mostly csgo and GTA 5 and this can run at 75hz. The first time I launched csgo on this monitor it felt more smoother I was confused I went to check Nvidia settings and surprisingly it said ""75hz"" OMG I could feel the difference way more, now I've decided to get a 144 hz monitor too.

Will write a update feedback after a month or more if I have time.",5
"One of the best Monitor price-to-performance +This Review according to My Monitor+
75 hz refresh rate
1 ms response time (it's really grateful for Gaming)
1. Freesync is supported. This means if you are using an AMD graphics card, your refresh rate increase 75Hz.
2. Reader/Custom modes are available. As a user who uses the PC for gaming along with web browsing, movie watching, programming, a reader mode is very much required. This monitor takes care of that.
3. Comes with a decent HDMI male-to-male connector. The cable quality might not be world-class but does a decent job of responsive video data transfer, when it comes to quick display changes (like gaming).
4. Minimal bezel at the edges.
5. Very Beautiful and faithful color representations.
6. All in all, a great monitor. I could not find anything to reduce even a half star from the product rating. 5 stars from me. Been using this for more than two weeks now.

I m not found any cons in my monitor
It's really very great monitor.
Value for money...",5
"Packaging was good. I was worried about damage during the transit. Monitor is working great and its the best in this price range. More importantly this monitor have vesa mount. You can mount it on the w
all or buy dual monitor arm and mount it using the vesa mount. This is something that other monitors in this price range lacks. On screen control software is also helpful you can keep upto 8 windows easily using that on screen control software. Purchased for 7.2k (7999 listed price+10% sbi cashback) overall satisfied with the product.

Update: monitor stand is poor. Monitor shakes(wobble) every time i type. First i thought it was the desk. After changing the desk the problem is still there.",3
"Saw lot of negative reviews for many monitors on Amazon , was not really sure which one to buy..
22 or 24 inch that was the question, settled for 22 as it was within budget and not too expensive.
Decision turned out to be right, the screen size is perfect , primarily wanted it as a secondary screen for my laptop to do work from home, so this does the job quite well.
The product was packed well from LG and was not damaged or opened when it arrived.
HDMI cable was included in the box.
Easy to setup.
Everything else is fine , meets my primary purpose of a secondary screen.

I'm from Mumbai and seller was apparo retail.",4
"if ur looking for a monitor this monitor is best under 10k for both gaming and color grading. i have been using this monitor for 10 days now, and here is my review with some tips for better experience.
1. the panel quality is really great for the price (Factory Calibrated colors) colors are spot on with great viewing angles
2. bezel less design looks really good
3. build quality is good, but the stand quality is just decent it wobbles
4. It comes with HDMI cable so this monitor has a headphone jack too for ur speakers or headphones
5. Some people complaint about white glow visible when viewing something black on screen, it is not a product issue at all it happens with all ips displays on higher end monitors it is less visible, and u will only notice this when the display is showing only black color

TIPS AND TRICKS
1. Better Colors - This display comes with black stabilizer (Gaming Feature) turn that to 0/off cause it makes blacks a bit greyish so for better colors turn that off
2. Avoid Screen Flashing - Sometimes the monitor automatically Lowers the brightness which causes screen flash to avoid this go to monitor settings and turn off smart energy saving
3. Unlock 75hz - To unlock 75hz, turn on free sync from monitor menu or via the the lg desktop app and set the response time to faster, then (if u have win 10) right click on desktop and go to display settings>Advanced display settings>Display adapter properties> go to monitor tab and select 75hz and press ok. after that go to nvidia or amd graphic control pannel and see if 75hz is selected if not, then select 75hz and enjoy",5
"It has been two months since I purchased the monitor. For the last two days, I am noticing red/purple and blue and horizontal lines in my monitor. I looked at overall positive * star rating, didnt focus on the -ve ratings for the monitor. I think I may have done a mistake. The exact same issue I am seeing is reported by few uses as I browse through the review section.

I will have to work customer service now. Let me see what they have to tell.",1
"Before placing the order the following doubt came to mind like the poor packing, handling & shipping damages, IPS glow & backlight bleeding , poor black etc as shared by the negative reviews . But when received the product I didn't found any. The monitor box came with extra packing box no damage to the product , picture & video quality is awesome no bleeding or ips glow. So many settings. 0-15 brightness is enough for normal work & no stress on eyes. The import date is latest. Extremely value for money , glad that I had placed the order . Let's see how it will perform in long run, will try to update later.",5
"The product reached on time as expected. It was worth waiting too ! Basically got the screen for my work as extension for my laptop .. it definitely helps in working more efficiently & bezelless monitor is a breeze to work with.
The base is quite sturdy & Monitor is almost weightless .
Didn't wait for the sale to begin as I felt the need for it & quite satisfied with it.",5
"This is my first monitor. I used a TN panel on an old laptop until now and this feels like a huge upgrade. The display is evenly lit and I do not observe any backlight bleed.

Pros:
1. Easy to set up and use
2. Good picture quality and contrast
3. Joystick navigation - More useful than you may think
4. Modern looking with thin bezels
5. Vesa mountable
6. Good antiglare while still keeping colours at a good saturation level

Cons:
1. Not enough range of brightness. I would prefer a much dimly lit display in the night.
2. Ports facing backwards - I would rather have the ports facing downwards so that I can keep the monitor closer to the wall

This display will be enough for anyone who is just looking for an add-on display or a good single display.",4
Awesome for 1080p gaming.. Though I was hesitant to buy this as it has amd free sync.. Which works with only amd graphics cards.. And I have an Nvidia 1060.. But ordered it due to its looks and amazing bezel less style.. And of course it's from LG so I bought it and ya I must say it looks amazing.. And build quality is great.. Just go for it and you won't regret.. Best one below 10k out there,5
"LG warranty is not real warranty, the support will be worst. This monitor got on curve black line and total screen got blue blurry lines. LG support simply saying this is physical damage and not covered under warranty. But they can't show the brocken part physically, simply saying physical damage basis on black line. I believe that black line and screen faulty due to heating in summer. But, they simply saying physical damage. Monitor work till night, i slept without power off, when i wake up next day, its not working.
Worst Warranty support by LG.",1
"Am not going to repeat the tech-specs here but I must say that this monitor has everything that most of us don't even know of or never bother to use those features.
Where it shines is picture quality and that's what matters in the end. I loved the brightness and crispness of the screen. The blacks are really black and there is no screen bleeding.",5
"This monitor just made my day and I hope this will never disappoint me. I was planning to buy this monitor since a year. I could have bought but didn't because of its price. I heard that people have bought this for 6500 INR so I waited for a long to buy this dude and believe me got it at a decent price of 7000 INR. Order got delivered within 3days but I was shocked to see the packaging it was terrific I was only hoping the product well inside the box and yes it was. Superb picture quality , perfect saturation level, gaming with this monitor is like üî•. No cons ( I will not forcefully bring out one). Go for it blindly if you are getting it in a good deal otherwise wait..",5
"Go for it if you're getting it under 8K There is No competition of this model. Bought in August and got product manufactured in July only, which is great. If you are confused between BenQ and this one go for this one. 22 inch is more than enough for programming and home use.",5
"One of the good options when it comes to buying monitors. The price might seem a bit high but the product is of top quality. Monitor can be customized to one's preferences using the menu options present. It's a proper FHD 1080p. The bezel less borders make it better. All features described are present.

Only bad thing for me is that there is only 1 HDMI port. Would've preferred another one instead of the DVI. Also the screen can't be adjusted too much vertically but that's not really an issue for me.",5
"It is working fine . It's aspect ratio is not good for reading. It is bit wide and images, texts may appear bit stretched. In Linux it is not suitable to read anything . In windows it is okay once you got aquainted with it. So buy if your intention is gaming otherwise think again",2
Ahh...it's really sexy. I use it to watch films at night like a bed tv. Ofcourse the prime purpose is to design UI and write codes with better view. I am happy with the purchase.,5
"Value for money, Good display. I really like the minimum bezels.
A single joystick button in bottom to control the power and all the functions.
Good options for Connectivity ports.
Came with HDMI cable.
Display quality is good, I‚Äôm using the display for programming.
Option for volume control but no speakers in the monitor. I think it‚Äôs for external speakers.",5
"I am not happy with the quality of the panel. Colours are not accurate. Maybe this is the max quality I can get for 10k. Maybe I have been spoilt by the excellent screens my phones have.

The monitor looks awesome. But colour accuracy is average. I tried calibrating it, but not as expected. Shadow areas are too dark. If you try to brighten it up, other areas become too bright. There is no balance.",4
"After many research i purchased LG screen and i thought it'll be good vcoz i have 1 already.
Bt in this 22MP68VQ (Right side in photos) 1. has awkward things not adjusted screen auto pr manually so edges of the screen are cut.
2. Awkward yellow colortone which i never have in same LG brand other monitor and it's not even adjust after many setting.
3. It has ips display same has i have other bt this has screen bleeding issues.
4. Not good for video editing or animation work bcoz extra yellow color can change ur whole videos color.
Other thn that it's good for regular usage if edges are not cut.",2
had a horrible experience buying from amazon. the Screen had vertical lines within 10 days of use. However due to the excellent service of the LG customer I got my screen replaced. I will recommend to buy from trusted sources offline. wont buy any electronics from amazon in the foreseeable future I guess.,3
"Product is very nice and it is as per the expectation.
I am not happy with the Delivery of the product from the Amazon. The product is Fragile product and delivery is suppose to be door step.
The Delivery guy drooped the product at Amazon collection point which is 12 Km away from the delivery address. Which was really never expected for such product.",1
"Would recommend it for console gaming(PS4), can not comment about the PC gaming experience as I don't use it for PC but the clarity and picture quality is unmatched to any screen in this particular segment of monitors(under 10,000) can also use it as a screen for Amazon prime or Netflix it is a 1080p screen with an IPS panel which shows more accurate colours and overall I would recommend it also the design is flawless and even Marilyn Monroe would be drab to this monitors beauty and elegance XD. On a serious note though it is a very good product and you can trust the brand too.",5
"The monitor is good but the one I received might be having a defect. Because tiny insects are going inside of display and one of them literally died in the middle of the screen. You can watch it in the picture. When I approached the service center for getting it cleaned, they said we cannot clean it and the only thing that can be done is changing the entire display panel but they will not do that because it's a small issue for them. So you have to wait for few more insects to get inside and die and then they might consider to change the panel. This clearly shows that the product is a defective one. Better buy other ones like Dell or Samsung.",1
"I bought this monitor for my work during the nationwide lockdown as I was frustrated working with small screen of my laptop. This monitor is pure treat to the eyes. Very clear & cripsp images, makes working for long hours easy. Can sit back & relax in chair while working as the large monitor makes things easy to read from a distance as well.

I also use to watch Netflix & other platforms too. Works quite well for me & my wife as a TV in a decent sized bedroom. We connect bluetooth speakers for audio as this monitor lacks only audio to use as a TV. Although it has a 3.5mm audio output which you can connect to an external speaker. I even tried my Fire TV stock on it, which works very well.

For someone planning to work from for next few month, someone who works on UI development or runs a stratup, this is a good investment.",5
"Positives are: Great image quality, great sharp bezels, and quick response time and as the box says Cinema screen, yes indeed it is.
Negatives: Ports at the right at the back (not even down or up in back its straight perpendicular back) you would end up using ""L"" shaped plugs for convenience, not so bright day light inside a room makes you feel the need of more brightness, inbuilt speakers would have been added advantage, additional HDMI port is very much needed.",4
"I purchased this monitor in June'20. From December'20 I started noticing LCD displaying stuck images of screen I was using alternatively. Now in past few weeks this has turned really bad that all screens are overlapping bad and stuck causing discomfort. I'm unable see anything clearly as images of windows I was using is getting stuck without refreshing.

Also, I switched of the monitor for almost 2 hours including Power. But when I switched still the screen came with these overlapping stuck images it.

I looking support this.!",1
"This IPS monitor has superior display and color reproduction is brilliant. Also it looks stylish, thanks to its thin bezel and curved monitor stand. Doesn't have backlight bleeding issue. At this budget its the best monitor out there.
Just one issue is the LG onscreen control software is not working in windows 10_1903. Hope it will be fixed soon.",5
"The packaging was worse. However, the product was delivered without any damage. Bought at ‚Çπ8000/- on Amazon Prime. The settings button is placed in the bottom of the monitor. The button is a single button which works like a joystick similar to the joystick of Nokia 6600. Used for seven days in a row and till now I have no complaints. Does the job decently. DPI could have been better but at this price range, it is a good deal. You can pay upto ‚Çπ10000 for this monitor. Hope this review is helpful. Warm wishes!",4
"The monitor is good and sturdy considering the price range. It also has a wall mount arrangement.

However, I find the screen-height adjustment bit clumsy, while in case of other montiors of HP or Dell they provide sophisticated height adjustment solutions.

Overall the product is very good.",5
"An awesome product. Amazon was really superb to to meet with my expectations of adequate packaging and on-time deliverable.
The monitor is worth considering and showcases one of the best products with a price to performance ratio which will not let you down in any aspect. Excellent and stunning display with vibrant colors will satisfy everyone.
The joystick controls seems good and new , although I felt a bit low on its sturdy and fast movement. This monitor is not completely bezel-less but the overall looks are quite pretty and the thin bezels are not that bad at all.
Enjoying using the monitor last 5 months. Hope this helps!!!",5
This monitor is good enough for general use but for gaming and media consumption it's terrible. There are two major issues with this monitor. First is that vertical lines appear on blue colour. I have seen this on multiple monitors of this make. Second is colour banding issue. This one appeared over time. It wasn't present earlier. Colour banding issue prevents display from giving smooth gradient. You can easily distinguish between different shades of colour.,1
With minimal usage in the last 6 months the monitor shows cracked screen display (monitor not physically cracked). Based on earlier reviews I had hoped it would last longer but that was not the case.,1
"I am using it as an extended monitor to my laptop.
1. It has got a great picture quality.
2. Colours are very precise.
3. Flicker free.
4. Normally it operates on 60hz. You can boost it to 75hz if your graphics card support it.
5. Movies, work, gaming, etc anything and you won't be disappointed.
6. Easy to assemble.
7. If you are looking for monitor with speakers it is not for you. I would rather suggest to buy external speakers.",5
"This is nice product under 10k.
1) having refresh rate of 75 hz. And with free sync with AMD GRAPHIC card. No tearing in games.
2) Bright colors, full HD 1080 p, with IPS panal. Great picture quality under 10k.
3) In light there is no problem in quality of picture. And in viewing angle up to 169 degree.",5
"Brightness not equal in entire the display,In White Background Left Side brightness little higher than the right side.its very uncomfortable to work on the background. IPS(In-plane switching) is a screen technology for LCDs. They are widely know for displaying consistent, accurate color from all viewing angle. but in this product its doesn't works great.",1
"This monitor is definitely worth buying. I got for Rs7999 and am very happy with the purchase. Picture quality is very good. NIce that it comes with necessary cables so it's ready to plug and play immediately. Base is a little larger than many monitors but it consists of heavy weight metal with black plastic covering so it's much more stable as a result.
Been using for almost 2 months now and have no complaints.",4
"One of the best low budget LG monitor in such a small pay. Just using it for 1 month. So far running quiet smoothly as pc monitor along with my PS3/PS4. Movie experience is quiet good, and gaming is ok too. Great purchase, thanks to the saler. Very good delivery all thanks to amazon.",5
"Good product, but i thought that the picture comes with full view as a bezel less experience. But the reservations gets some blank space around the monitor that's why I can't enjoy as a basal this experience and some of the icons and their names is not totally visible because of the resolutions management is not so good but over I can say it's a good product.
Picture quality is good but I thought that more brightness I could see because it is called ""full HD display"".",3
"Perfect for gaming!!
Pros-
Perfect Screen Size(nor too big nor too small)
Matte finish screen is best in its class
Unlocks 75fps
Good colour production
Wall mount option available
Lg onscreen control software works like a charm

Cons-
Glossy black finish
Monitor stand is slightly old fashioned",5
Overall good experience with the monitor for the first 2.5 years and suddenly small black spots was visible on the screen i ignored it as it was very small but slowly slowly it increased and became 8-9 black spots and was increasing day by day. So as the warranty is of 3 years i was lucky i saw and only 3 months was remaining i registered complain to lg toll free number they said within 72 hours a engineer will visit my home but no one came for 17-18 days i called them every alternate day and they always say we will do it in priority but didn't they gave me lg service centre number which is near to my home but no one used to pick up the call then I send a tweet to Lg on twitter and scolded lg service centre on call too one day so on that same day only a engineer came and checked my monitor and took pic and in the next 2 days he came with a new panel and replaced it and now my montitor looks new and working fine . The service was delayed i asked the engineer he said due to covid many complaind are there so it may be dealyed.,4
"I just purchased by New Monitor before few days from Amazon. And now I'm using it as my primary display! But seriously the quality of this LG IPS Monitor is awesome. I'm using it for Graphic Design, Gaming, as well as movie watching but the experience, was very nice with this one!

You can go with this monitor if you need an average size & borderless computer monitor. This LG Computer Monitor comes with a few handy features like

- AMD Free sync
- Black Stabilizer
- 4 Screen Split

The monitor comes with FULL HD IPS Display which gives you crystal clear image & video quality.",5
"The overall quality and price to performance ratio of this monitor is really really impressive, although when it comes to looks this display can beat any panel out right now but, there are few things which should be mentioned that are, this is glossy finished display that's why whenever it comes in contact with dust it catches it and due to hollow neak of the stand the shoks or we often say it as some minor push results in shaking of whole display. Guys if you have good graphics card and decent speed of the internet you can play even 4k videos smoothly. Overall the display is really really good as compared to amount of money we are going to pay.",4
"I had recieved a faulty(the right half of the screen was dull and yellowish) piece previously,then I returned it and the new one is working fine.

This LG monitor looks good and does the job pretty well.No glare at all and the display is crisp enough for gaming and watching movies or editing videos.",4
"I bought this monitor on the festival sale in 7200 rs including bank offer,the monitor i received had a screen issues.at first i didn't notice because it was not noticeable from more than 2 ft.after noticing the issue i ordered a replaced with in a week i got the replacement.now i didn't find any issue with the monitor its working perfectly as it should.if i find any issue in near future i will update my review.also one thing headphone port was not working with the vga connection, i had to use mini hdmi to hdmi cable to connect the monitor because my graphics card has mini hdmi port, now headphone port is working perfectly.",5
"The monitor is good and has wide angle view. Well, you can read the specification very well and I will not hesitate to get it. Overall the monitor is sharp and have thin bezel which makes it more sleek and also if you have intention of setting up multiple screen this is perfect. The only complain that I have is the stand, which is a little wobbly.",5
"It worked well for a month and after it the display panel was showing cracks on the screen no outer damage
Asked for replacement or repair they ask for a cost more than the price
It is in warranty period",1
"This monitor is Full HD 1080P resolution, comes with HDMI, VGA and DVI Ports. Picture clarity is good, thin bezel and well suitable for regular office applications. I am using for CCTV Monitoring as well as for my laptop as dual monitor. With menu button on two click i can switch between VGA and HDMI, no need to go with a long list of menu options and then select. This monitor also comes with Wall mounting option which is suitable for CCTV installers.",5
"So far it's great
Comes with HDMI cable no need to buy one !
Build is solid
Color reproduction is factory calibrated , better than other same price ranged products
And yes amd freesync works great ""make sure you turn
it on from settings"" üôå paired with Readon RX 570 no screen tearing!",5
"Im already using this Monitor in my office so I don't want to check any review, this have very good picture quality and colour are pretty much accurate. No issues on viewing angles. This is actually not a LED monitor guys its LED backlight monitor so don't misunderstand you can check the difference in google . Best product under this price segment. It is 60hz so no for gamers . Im a photoshop user its very good for that kind of uses..",4
"- Good colors
- Easy installation
- Software provided gives additional features like split screen
- economic gaming monitor
- Free sync works ok
- Good design
- Only 5ms response time, seems to be a negative point, w.resp.to gaming.",5
"I've been using it for around 3 weeks and here's what I liked about it:
Picture quality: 9/10. I have to sit before my monitor for 8-9 hours a day because of my profession. I'm genuinely pleased with the clarity. Color accuracy is also quite good. LG IPS panels don't let down usually.
Anti-glare: Does a decent job. At least in indoor lighting conditions. I've tried keep the window opposite to my workstation open. It glares, as you'd expect. However, I can't ask for more from a monitor this cheap.
Not a gamer, can't say much about gaming.

Small features that I needed but you may not care about: thin bezels, presence of both HDMI and
VGA ports.

Overall, not the best monitor I've used. However, I received it for 7.8k INR. Which, given how good it is, is a steal. Can't ask more from a monitor this cheap.",4
"Its a nice nice panel at this cost. But the issue I saw was of light bleeding from corners but in well lit room its not that visible. Anyhow, the monitor is good and gives what it promises. The CD in the box was already cracked. Don't know how that can happen when there was not even a single dent on the packing box. Well, software are downloadable from internet an hence it was of no concern. I use the screen with ps4 and laptop and it looks awesome.",5
"Picture quality with various modes are great for setting individual preferences. The custom mode this monitor comes with is too bright and is not recommended for long viewing hours.

Installation is a breeze , comes with HDMI cable. Register online @LG site for warranty.
Pre-calibrated , install the software that comes with the monitor for additional functions
Cons:
Lack of height adjustment",4
"I am reviewing it after 1 month and so far I am blown away by the colors of this ips monitor...
And it did not have any light bleeding so thats a plus point.. it has 75hz but be aware that its only available when freesync is on and only in hdmi not in dvi or vga... And the freesync will not work on nvidia but 75hz works.. and This is also brightest monitor i have used so far.. thats also a good thing..",5
"Got it for 6752/- during the recent sale, very good monitor at this price. Vibrant colors, less bezel, Light weight compared to my previous DELL monitor which I used for 12 years. Only problem I had was the HDMI connector should have been angled so it doesn't touch the wall behind monitor.",5
"About picture quality is awesome ,it's is the FHD 1920*1080 pixels.
Screen
Colour reproduction is good pre calibrated and it's come with nice features like HDMI DVI Port and free since technology overall
Value for money in this pricing segment.",4
"Writing this after just 4 hours of usage.
I was sick of VGA LED monitor. So I gave it a try after reading overwhelming rating of 4+ on amazon.
I use Linux mint OS and I was particularly hesitant whether this will be supported. Usually the FHD VGA monitors have issue with Linux Mint or Ubuntu OS.
But I was STUNNED by the CLARITY of this monitor and the FONTS ARE HAIR THIN clear and the COLORS are stunning. If you want a FHD IPS upgrade for your LINUX OS go ahead and give it a try.

Also, I bought it at price of 7.7K and it got delivered less than 24 Hours during Diwali so I am very satisfied.",5
"Its a great monitor.

Pros:
- HD quality output. Sharp and crisp text and pictures on the screen
- Easy installation
- Screen's bezel is almost none which makes the monitor look cute

Cons:
- Can't adjust the height perhaps, but it can be tilted.",5
"I ordered it for development but now I am using it for multiple reasons.
1. It's full HD si it is good for development.
2. High resolution games graphics looks great.
3. Picture quality is awesome.
4. Using it as a TV too.
5. Supports HDMI so I can connect to my HD dish TV or to my Laptop/Computer.
6. It has built-in Audio out which helps a lot when I connect it as a tv.",5
Worth the money! A very good Product! I bought this for Rs. 6299/- during the Amazon sale and it every bit worth it. Amazing picture clarity and good frame rate. I even connected my PS4 and Amazon FireStick qnd was amazed with the picture quality. Its built for gaming. Worth buying this Monitor! Also the packaging was good. Delivery was also on time.,5
Great monitor speacially as i got it for 6k on the amazon sale. Worth the money. I usually use this as a seco d mo itor when working (typically has outlook open) or mostly use this for my ps4. Only con i see it it doest aito detect the input source between dvi and hdmi and i have to manually switch.,4
"Very good product. Didn buy it for gaming purpose, I predominately use it for just streaming movies and browsing, for which this product is absolutely worth it.
Have to say the freesync feature can't be switched on, I think it can be enabled only if you have a graphic card. Also I noticed there are some light bleeding issues along all the edges when I turn on the screen. But it is only visible when the screen is black, so it won't be affecting that much for a normal user. But in case if you work on black background a lot, then it might be disturbing. None of the above issues bothered me since I use it for only streaming movies, so I would say overall it's a very good product.",4
"My only dislike about this monitor is the brightness. It is too bright, even when the brightness is set to 0. Apart from that, I had issues with this monitor when I was using linux. On windows, it worked perfectly.

I brought this for the 16:9 ratio. A part of my three monitor setup, I am very satisfied with this purchase.",5
"My purpose - mainly coding, very little premier pro and moderate gaming - Dota 2, RON.
Requirements - Sharp text, accurate/true to life colours. Refresh rate not an issue to me.
It has a good LG software to use multi screen like features.
Easy settings joystick.
Colours are good.
NOTE - It's not edge to edge display as shown in the images. There is a SLIGHT border that gets hidden by the top anti glare layer. But it's not a deal breaker with very thin bezel.

No cons as such, it's just a 9k display. Did not experience bleeding issues or even if it's there, not that prominent to affect my work.
Picture quality is really good.
Anti glare layer helps a lot and possibly for gaming but I don't use much for gaming.",5
"This is the bottom line. If you want a monitor that is best bang for the buck, this is the product to buy. I bought two and have them set up on a dual arm VESA mount.

Best features:

IPS Panel 60Hz with LED back light
6 different color modes (some better for darker environment, for reading, for movies, for coding)
VESA mount (a must have for dual monitor setup)
A fairly thin bezel on three sides",5
"Colours are awesome, having HDMI port and Audio out port makes it a complete Tv type fills just add chromecast or HDMI set top Box and speakers to screen and you have Tv ready. Obviously add it with VGA port to CPU and your Computer is ready. Multiple use and very sleek and trendy.",5
It's such a big difference moving from 1440 x 900 to a 1920 x 1080 resolution monitor. Great clarity and worth the cost. I bought it for Rs7399 during festival season,5

 1..Pixels dont perfectly display colors during DARK/GREY/SHADOW areas WHILE watching MOVIES and during playing GAMES
I.e. u are able to see Small Small pixel dots in those dark/grey/shadow areas which LOOKS VERY TERRIBLE..I regret buying this budget monitor .ü§ï

2..If u guys are buying this for PHOTO EDITING and normal OFFICE WORK then Its Good

3..But DON'T BUY it for watching MOVIES and playing GAMES bcz it Shows CLOUDING effect (YouTube it) as discuss in point 1 above..

4. IPS panel used here is cheapest one that's why it's for 8k to 9k ..I recommend Go for higher range of IPS panel for perfect picture quality..

5...If u can compromise picture quality for budget then buy it ..otherwise don't buy it .bcz it's not perfect budget monitor as u will expect..

6...I also replaced monitor but then to this issue (point 1 ) persist ....and this ISSUE PERSIST IN EVERY LG22MP68VQ monitor bcz the IPS PANEL is same in every unit of this model ...

7...FINAL VERDICT DON'T BUY ANY MONITOR FROM ONLINE AS U CAN'T GET TO KNOW ABOUT such CLOUDING issues ...BUY FORM LOCAL STORE AND DIFFERENT MODEL BUT NOT THIS ONE ..",3
I bought this screen for office work. Easy to set up. But noticed a yellow tinge in parts of the the screen when background in white. Would not recommend to others,2
"Very disappointed the monitor is not working , display is not turn on",1
"I have bought this 22MP68VQ IPS Monitor just only 6000 rupees on Amazon Great Indian Festival sale. Picture quality is Awesome^2 and overall performance is üëåüëåIf you want to buy a new monitor, I suggest you buy it blindly.",5
"This monitor displays faint vertical white lines at 75hz which are clearly visible on blue and yellow/orange colors. The reason seems to be the cheap IPS panel. Google for ""vertical lines 75hz"" and you will get many results on this topic. The right side of the monitor is bit yellowish as well. Thankfully backlight bleed isnt that visible.",3
"1. Not good for office work but okok.text matter is not sharp. As mentioned on the outer box, this is ideal for movies and entertainment and not for work.
2. Poor plastic quality and delicate stand. So, handle with care.
3. I got for Rs.7100 after Sri credit card and freedom sale.",3
This monitor has excellent clarity and resolution. I would have not returned if the display had consistent colour spread. the unit I got has yelloish shade at 60% of the screen at right side,5
"A terrific purchase at the price point. The screen is good, robust and has great color accuracy. AMD freesync is useful for system having AMD video cards.
You can't go wrong woth the purchase. It's been 6 months the screen is as good as new. The thins bezels do look good and the display attracts everyone who sees it. Happy with the product.",5
"I used this monitor to extend my laptop display. It is perfect for extended display. Resolution is good. You can use hdmi cable to connect to the laptop. It still has vgi port along with 3.5mm output port for audio.
The box contained an hdmi cable. So no need to buy new. The box had one hdmi cable, stand for monitor and power plug.",5
Great product. I neede a hdmi monitor for my new pi 4b. I loved the product . It has small joystick üïπÔ∏è like switches for navigation. The only bad thing is it's packaging. Another thing is that there is no height adjustment with the stock stand. It is also slim,5
"Best in class monitor .Best for budget segment pc best picture quality gives a very very good refreh rate with my AMD processor and precision while gaming. only
con it does not come with inbulit speaker but thats a very little problem . rest every thing is best in this monitor. Go For It.",5
"AMD graphics card is supported 1080p
Nvidia graphics is supported 1080p ,but crash after 10min
Only turn on freesync is supported 1080p in Nvidia graphics,
Response time 5ms, total suck so anyone want to buy contact me 50% offer for you",2
"Picture is not crisp when I am connecting to Laptop.
Average product. Was expecting much better quality from LG.
Made in china monitor but from LG company. Wondering why cant they make it India.",2
"The cable sent is HDMI. My PC has only D-Sub and DVI-D. The Owner's Manual CD would not open in PDF Reader.
There is no printed manual. Most of the other information is in Chinese (?). Therefore, I can't adjust resolution or glare. I need Amazon's help",4
"I was confused just like you whether to buy this or not but since I bought this and after 4 to 5 months of use I wanna say it that it's great. It's amazing. I couldnt have got any better monitor in this price. I uploaded a video but then it had some policy issues. But anyways, go for it. It's awesome. I am using it with my lenovo x230 laptop and it's working just butter‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"I bought this mainly for codingand light gaming purpose and for a budget gamer it is nice far from perfect but yes the picture quality is good and the size of the monitor is decent enough that small objects can be seen from a decent distance from the computer.
The are two things that take away one star is
1. While playing fast pace games like cod or cs go it stutters a bit
2. The audio output port is a bit loose it might be only in my monitor
All in all its the best monitor u can have under 10k. For its price it gives you the best features . Go for it .",4
"Good monitor under budget, I replaced the first monitor because the panel has warm tint on half right side it's kind of yellowish shade and then I received a replacement it's lot better then previous one,But I think this monitor panels have this tint issueü§î as you can see in the pictures
For gaming:-
I'm using this monitor with Nvidia 1050ti at 75hz refresh rate it goodüëç
For general use:-
Excellent üëå",5
"Product was delivered 4 days before ETA by Amazon, thumbs up to Amazon for the delivery in a healthy condition. The package had the monitor, a stand, a hdmi cable, a power cable, cd, warranty and guidlines documents along with it. Installation was super easy. Recomended resolution for Windows 10 is 1980*1080 which makes the picture look real. The design is borderless and literally feels like looking through a window. It is the best monitor I have ever used and its no doubt a value for money product. I would recommend this product for those who are interested.",5
"If you already have a great Primary monitor and you want to supplement it with another one go with this as this is great for the price you pay. Usually you don't need more than 60Hz Second monitor while the primary one being a min of 120Hz.
Picture Quality - 4
Anti Glare - 5
Video Editing Experience - 5",4
I would just say one thing that this monitor can beat every monitors out there in the market. Even it's better than Benq. After switch on my computer I just speechless by seeing the screen quality and color reproduction. This monitor definitely change your computing system. If you afford some penny please go with monitor without any hesitation.,5
Superb display.You can notice the difference between a laptop screen and this LG monitor.Such a good clarity and detail is found only on Led Tv .,5
If you are going to watch movies on it ..dont buy as picture quality is not that good as screen lags while watching fast moving action scenes on it...and the lg service guys said it is not made for that..,1
"The monitor is just awesome in this price range. Something which is eye catching is the picture quality, though the screen is 1080p but the picture quality is not much clear. There is no speaker provided with the monitor and the build quality is average but that thing doesn't matters because this is the best monitor one can get in this budget. Beside these cons the monitor is fabulous with bright ips led panel, light weight and have easy installation procedures.",5
"after many evaluation i bought this monitor but received defective product with a large shadow on screen right side of the display

Update : Product Replaced with Newone and the Problem is heavy backlite even I kept brightness to 0",3
"Perfect product
Contrast is proper
Blacks looks fantastic
Color reproduction is awesome

75Hz works even on Nvidia cards:
Switch on freesync
Open Nvidia control panel >Custom resolutions > create 1920*1080 @75Hz. Set Refresh rate to 74Hz in Nvidia custom resolution if anyone is facing microstutters.",5
"Very good monitor, parking was ok. The only confusing part is that, in description it is mentioned as LED and on box LCD. I was confused with that. When chacked with customer care they said it is LCD monitor with LED backlight. Good part is, the monitor coming with HDMI cable and no need to buy seperate one",5
"this is a super product. i am using for few days and could not ask for more, it makes work from home to easy. you will get a HDMI cable and power cable with it. picture quality is super and viewing angles are good, go for it without any second thought",5
"So I'm using theis monitor for 2 days.. the good thing is that it's very slim and it has wall mount. I would prefer you guys to go for wall mount as the monitor stan is not very good it shakes too much even the slightest vibration in the desk makes it shake so if you don't like shakey monitor while gaming i would suggest use a wall mount. Overall it's best in this price range comes with AMD FREESYNC, if you have AMD gpu go for it. Nvidia users sadly this is not for you guys.. :)",3
watch out the difference !! nice computing and movie viewing experience. I m not an expert but this is pretty decent monitor in this price range. I thoroughly did research for 5-6 days before buying this one and satisfied with it. For long term review will uodate my review after 3 months.,5
Fantastic TV. But remember that there is NO BUILT IN AUDIO. Luckily I have a wireless headset and I mainly use it as a dual monitor setup or play console games on it.,4
"I'm writing this after 1 year of usage. Bought this monitor for 6999 in lightning deal.
1. Display quality is good compared to other
2. It's good for gaming with 75Hz refresh rate
3. It's got very minimal bezels
4. I didn't like the stand much

At this price point it can't get any better.",5
When comes to picture quality it provide accurate colours in movie and videos and also games and with the bazel less display that makes it best looking monitor in 10k..it comes with hdmi cable that is another advantage because you dont have to purchase separately and that will help lot for tose who have graphics cards...bt i give it 4 star becoz the left side of the display give whitten bt right side is little bit yellowish bocz it have reading mode with split screen bt if you not notice it detailed then it cant be a problem otherwise it is ok for me,4
"Useful for coding, enough large second screen.
Good quality as for movie/TV Series watching experience.
HDMI cable came with the box.
-----
No in-built speakers. AUX port for external speaker connect.
Fixed height stand.
Made in China.",5

 Easy to install.. 75hz 1920x1080 resolution.. looks good , very light weight.. has a app called On Screen Control which we can use to adjust settings without button so that's great .. DOESN'T HAVE NVIDIA SYNC!!",5
"I liked this product and enjoy doing primary work on it. Only thing got it at 9k, but wish I had save a 1k during sale during prime days. Also I thought the screen can't be adjusted or tilted, but u can do it just by holding the screen top and bottom and incline the angels accordingly.",4
I've been using it for the last 8 months Comparing monitor sold at a higher price is not in any way a match with it. It is very good in quality and its performance during use. Those who buy at Budget price can buy freely without any doubt. It's really LIFE'S GOOD,5
Below average monitor. Disappointed to see the performance of this monitor.within few days after purchase started to see shadows of text so ordered replacement but the new one also showing same issue after a week of use.,1
"The overall outer looks and packaging was impressive. I ordered it seeing so many good reviews about it. But in practical, I was disappointed with it's flickering and too much backlight bleeding and washed out colors. I tried a lot with the calibration but not got good results. So returned it.",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Pros
1) Thin bezels.
2) No backlight issues.
3) Good packaging and timely delivery.

Cons
1) Shaky stand. The screen vibrates even on the slightest of movement on the desk.
2) Screen is a little forward tilted and hence does not provide a good viewing angle. This won't be an issue for wall mounting.",4
"You will not regret buying this monitor, It has a 75Hz refresh rate and 5ms response time which provides an immersive experience. If you are thinking that 22 ich is not big, trust me it is very big cinema screen which provides you ultimate experience. If you are a very hardcore gamer, who does very competitive gaming then go for Samsung 144 Hz VA panel monitor which has 1ms response time. If you are a beginner in PC building or wants monitor for dual screen setup or some other reason, this is for you. It's worth your money.",5
"The display quality is good, even though i hate matte screens, i could get used to this one.

only cons:
1. It would be good if it had two hdmi ports.
2.I had some minor artifacts show up in 900p resolution, you can turn on gpu scaling in your computer to resolve it but at the cost of added input lag and some performance drop which isnt favourable for esports title like csgo and valorant which many of us play at lower resolutions for extra frames.",4
"The antiglare is perfect. One problem with the overall design is the base. It could have been a little heavier. As a result of the light weight the monitor wobbles a lot. Picture quality is super awesome.

Worst customer service by LG. Downgrading the rating. They do not even acknowledge the design issue with the stand.",1
"Just amazing, perfect colors and details the blacks r so good. Ips panel does the job well. Came with sealed box perfectly delivered with care no damage anything from appario seller. Display is perfect for gaming it has 75hz refresh Rate also with screen tearing it play the games butter smooth. Colors r so perfect not over saturated.

Worth for the game, video editing also. Bang for buck close ur eyes and go for it. Best led monitor under 10k. With amd sync, 75hz refresh rate full HD screen anti glare. So just buy it without any second thought",5
"I previously had same model monitor purchased in 2018. Back then the picture quality was much better, the previous monitor got some serious green lines at so had to purchase new one. But this new make does not even make up for clarity of previous make. It has some serious ghosting issue and even screen is bit on dull side and yellowish. Check the photo... the one on right is 2018 monitor vs 2020 new monitor on left",2
"Amazing monitor. I am using it for my PS4. Had to replace once due to green lines appearing in the 1st piece but 2nd is totally good. It's a budget monitor, I bought it for 8k in sale. It has an AUX cable which is helpful for ps4. And picture quality is good and crystal clear.",5
Picture quality is better but there is slight sharpening effect comes in when anything moving on the screen you will notice if u see carefully overall is good product at this price it might hurt your eyes if you are not used to bright screens. if u seat closer to monitor its better to keep brightness low. I prefer slightly bigger screen display than just 22 inch may be 24 inch will be really good. If anyone is on budget then this is the better monitor that's why i chose this one.,5
"Monitor audio is not working. I checked it late, first i thought it was some settings issue but later found out that this is a hardware issue. LG service took one month to process all this and said they won't replace it, only repair it. Sending a faulty product and not replacing it, is the worst service.

I would never recommend buying such company products who has this kind of service.

Please throughly check all the features on the first day it self.",1
"It's a great monitor but the build quality doesn't seem to be up to the expectations. I sparingly used this monitor. Maybe 1-2 hours on weekends and in a year the panel had lines all over and started leaking fluid. LG service was very good to fix it in just a few days. But 6 months later I have the exact same issue again. It's still in warranty so I will change my review again if LG fixes it and it lasts me at least a ""few"" years",1
"Best buy 22 inch screen.
got stucked b/w BenQ and LG. LG wins.
I bought this at 6200+799(SBI cashback)=6999-/ (amazon sale on Sept 28-31Oct)
best Quality under value of 6200. I wish i had bought bigger screen than this. though this one is amazing but always better to go for big. Buy if you are extending your screen over PC / Laptop
can also use for gaming. wait for few more months if you can. new models are coming with more new features.",5
"UPDATED REVIEW:
I have been using this monitor for almost 3 years and now it has a red horizontal line on the display. Although the line is very thin and unobtrusive, it is easy to see to the naked eye on a grey background. The red line indicates that the panel / display is about to die.

Fortunately, LG offers 3 year warranty for this product and this issue popped up 10 days before the end of the warranty period (Thank God!). After a quick chat with the LG customer care, they had sent a technician to my house and within 3-4 days, they replaced the display of this monitor. Don't know if the display will die soon but I did get a full replacement like they promised and I am happy about it.

Nevertheless, I expected a LG monitor to work flawlessly for at least 5 years. Hope the new display does not die soon as I really love this monitor. For now, it is as good as new.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OLD REVIEW: Absolutely Gorgeous! One of the best deals out there. Paid Rs 80 extra for 2 day delivery, but the Packaging was mind blowing. The brightness sometimes feels high, but easily adjustable. Picture quality is amazing. Could've added more Tilt, I guess. It's a perfect monitor for gaming and content creation.",3
"I brought this as an extended monitor for my WFH. I ended up using this as my primary monitor than the existing DELL. This is incredibly slim and very good picture quality. No eyestrain. Easy to install and very good selection of ports. So far no ""Cons"" in my view.",5
"Pro: video quality, style and anti glare.
Cons: Text looks jagged/pixelated. So not good for coding or text only work. I've connected it macbook pro using HDMI cable but was not able to use it.",2
"Pros :
Nice display
Hdmi support
good size to put it in table
natural colurs
Good refresh rate
Affordable price
Cons :
No Wall mount support
Only one HDMI
No external speakers",4
"Just 1week over using this monitor screen adjustment automatically according to light available in the room which is nice feature.
Didn't find any problem so far will see for another 2-3months for deep review.",5
"A beautiful monitor with really good color reproduction. Enable freesync and the picture colors become even more vibrant, you unlock 75hz as well. I used a gtx 1660 super with this monitor and it works flawlessly. Even with the hdmi cable, freesync is achievable (at least in my case). Go for this if you want a budget monitor with really good value for money. 75hz i know is not a great improvement over 60, but even a slight increase above 60 is noticeable.",5
"EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT FOR THIS PRICE (LG)
but this is not all borderless as they mentioned there is an extra black out around the bordeR.(This is not gooD)
the display quality is good with IPS but there is an grey out on the screen, not pure black.",3
"HDMI or VGA Cable not found with a monitor box. The second is that the monitor automatically changes the resolution. Sometimes it takes 800-600, sometimes it takes 1024-768. After one hour or two, the monitor switch is off automatically. Most of the time, even after contacting the service centers, one person (Mr.Jadhav-Virar) came and saw the monitor, only after four days. And I told me ‚ÄúI will talk to my seniors‚Äù. After that, they do not reply even after calling.",1
"Excellent purchase on this segment.

Pros:
22"" screen more than sufficient.
Split screen working flawless with ""LG Onscreen Control"" software.
Tilt, yes possible to the extent, that benefits your need.
No lag.

Cons:
No Height adjustment
No Inbuilt speaker (Not needed though)

Good choice if you are looking for a moderate office usage.",5
"This is an entry level economical monitor. Picture quality is good, colour is also good. However on some application dialog box I get slightly blurry text. That's strange, probably an OS problem, I am not sure.",4
"It took me 3-4 days of continous calibration using Nvidia , the montior settings and some 3rd party software to achieve the display as my S10+ amoled display ( though not the blacks). The display is not very sharp. I am lucky that I didnt bought a bigger one. 75hz works fine and i have calibrated the display on it. I am attaching pics. NEVER GO TN FOR HIGHER REFRESH RATE. This thing has awesome panel.",5
"It's really a nice product in this budget segment .. IPS panel with 60Hz & u can freesync upto 75Hz thru any AMD freesync GPU ,, even it's working with my Nvidia 1050ti or any Nvidia High Version Card. Build quality is much better but allover quality is very good.",5
Product is good and picture quality is amazing. But received defective product as screen has the bleeding in the bottom. Part of the monitor issue raised request for replacement hope for new and good one.,2
"After two weeks of usage I don't found any fault or anything negative with with monitor. And the delivery I got it 1 day before. Display is crisp and colors are punchy, blacks are great and there are multiple modes for us to customize depending on our work. I loved it and delivers a overall good performance. Those thin bezels makes our movie time even crisp greater. I got it for 7899 during big billion days. Definitely a worth buying and I'm experiencing it. Go for it blindly.",5
"Beware !!!! This product is not wall-mountable. The product description clearly says the product is wall-mountable, but it is not. So if you are looking for a wall-mountable monitor... do not buy this product",1
"I bought this as a home monitor to connect to my laptop. Was quite disappointed with the build . Very flimsy. More importantly this is not height adjustable( very low on the stand length) and this adds lot of strain to your shoulders, basically defecating the purpose of a monitor. and this does not have a back lit option to work in the night.",2
"I got this LG product 2 days back monitor on the right side is not working replacement was ordered i thought issue will be solved, surprisingly today the amazon delivery guy came to take defect product cancelled my replacement order as monitor not showing right side.
Real stupid product and stupid service by amazon delivery guy behavior not ready to listen reason for replacement.
frustrating service of Amazon.",1
"From last 1 year, I using this monitor and have an awesome experience with it.
Overalls it's a good product by LG.
Picture quality is superb.
It has 'On screen Control ' software by LG from where I can split the screen, change Picture quality and increase and decrease brightness and contast quality as well.
Also, it has an auto power-saving mode.

For games, it's a good product in the budget.",5
"over all a nice product by LG owners manual is not present inside the box just found a paper with installation guide how to attach frame to mointor.
features descrtions i have to find out on lg website.

delivery person was awful expriance.
delivery time was good.
thanks to amazon",5
"I was looking for a good monitor for my WFH setup. This monitor ticked all the boxes. E2e display, crisp text, amazing colour reproduction and matte finish were too good. BenQ was there in contention but having good service center experiences with LG made me take this decision. No regrets on buying.",5
"Overall its good. But i feel its not good for eyes. although i says Full HD but picture quality is not that clear... i m using it since 3-4 weeks and i feel that its affecting my eyes, want to sell it and buy 4k instead.

I have connected this monitor with Mac Pro and windows laptop using KVM switch with HDMI cables... output is not crystal clear as i expected.",3
"The picture quality is excellent with crisp colours. I had bought this monitor because of the headphone jack present in it. I didn't know that it only works in HDMI connection and not for a DSUB connection. But I found this monitor to be one of the best in this price range. So, I don't much regret my decision.",4
"amazing monitor within the 9k price range with a lot of features
Picture quality is great and its light weight.

This does not have built in sound/speakers, incase you want that FYI, although audio out option is present.

will update incase of issues here. for now im satisfied with the quality and delivery of this product",4
"The display failed just 15 days after the purchase. The moniter is not even turning on. Since the return period is 10 days, I have to claim the warranty from LG. There is a reason this product is going for such low cost and thats ""ABYSMAL QUALITY "".",1
"OP screen. Op color reproduction. OP viewing angles.
The only problem is 10%(left) of the screen is slightly dimmer than the rest. Though when the monitor gets warm it becomes less visible.
Recommended for gaming, programming, and color correction.",4
"First impression:

Packaging was a safe. Easy setup, took literally 10 mins to set it all up. Picture quality good. Got the HDMI cables. Will post another review post a few days.",4
"Totally bad product, I still have no idea how this product got 4.5-star ratings. The display is too bright. Even after keeping the lowest and minimal brightness and other settings, picture is not mild. The user's eyes will soar within 10 mins of work on it. Never buy and waste your money.",1
"Best monitor under 10k. Got it for 6999 on great Indian festival. 22inch is a huge one considering Iam ugegared from 15 inch to 22.colour quality and brightness are great. For gaming it's the best ips panel under 10 k. Don't go for 24 inch gaming monitors for extra 3k just to get 2 inch extra. There is some minor bleeding is here, but as for the price it's a great value monitor. Even some high end monitors suffers bleeding issues.",5
"Value for money. Very good product. It's been more than a month now, serving it's purpose well.
Haven't it used it really for gaming so cannot comment on gaming.",5
Everything is good about this monitor but it has white backlit bleed spreading from entire width of top of the monitor making every flat title bars a bit round which is visually annoying to me.,4
"Purchased it in December last year. No problem so far. Very easy to install. Crisp lettering, and color reproduction/contrast was to my satisfaction (I'm a painter, so this is an issue with me... reason I didn't want to let go of my old CRT monitor for a long time).",5
"Till now, Using for more than a week after delivery. I got a good unit with no defects, that I can notice. I am More than happy to use this monitor. Pictures quality and viewing angles are the best. Actually in my opinion, this monitor competes and even beats most of high end TVs also in terms of picture quality.",5
"Full HD and great quality, sleek. Value for money.

I have bought 2 of these monitors, buy from below seller....very happy with the service.

Bought from https://amzn.to/3cVC2Qt",5
"Not compared it with any monitor but I like it. Quality and colour output is great. I personally liked it for budget. If you are looking for best in budget, go for it. I purchased in late 2020 and you can check it's launch date and year. It is older but still great if you don't want extra features.",4
Neat monitor. I am not a geek so don't know how it is for power users. For 1080p 60fps gaming this is the best budget ips panel. I have used it for a week and will update regarding durability.,5
"The monitor has a well calibrated display, the picture is more crisp and clear than other monitors. The quick picture mode helps in good color enhancement for gaming and other conventional use. At this price range, one of the best monitors.",5
Received defective product first time ab ordered for replacement and that was worser than the the product I received in first time. Very disappointed. That was Worst experience. Amazon has given refund at the end.,1
Best monitor. I used this for coding and programming purpose where before in laptop screen I used to feel stress on my eyes so I extended my screen and it is really good if you want to use long hour ( reader mode). I compare with other monitors but I bought this for two reason one is wall mount support and LED screen,4
"Good picture quality for the price (6401‚Çπ), one less star because of one dead pixel at lower right area (isn't noticable from normal viewing distance ).",4
Correct product received with good condition. The power adaptor 19V supplied with this is not working properly. Screen gone off often. Now screen is getting off after 10 to 15 minutes after getting on. Checked by the electrician and conformed to change the adaptor. No problem in the monitor. Replacement is required for adaptor.,3
The product is just awesome. Nothing to say it. It is the best budget monitor that I could have bought at the price of 7000 during the sale. Though with other bank offers you can purchase it at 6300. Nothing to worry just go for it if you're in a tight budget.,5
Bought it back '18 when it was on sale and had some stupid offers on it I at the end just paid 6600 for it and it's been great I need another but it never goes below 8 and it's like when I already bought one for 6.6 you don't wanna pay more than that for it,5
"Built quality is very good,
It is not Bezel less.
Sound quality is good. (Connect via HDMI)
Less power consumption options
75hz option for gaming
Good brightness & contrast
Option for multiple scren option & PIP.
antiglare is good.",5
This LG monitor is really one of the best in this price range. Looks amazing and the picture quality is also great. Little tough to wall mount but the table stand is made of good quality plastic with metal inside it.,5
"Excellent monitor at this price range .display is really really nice and the colors are all really vibrant. It supports freesync and upto 75Hz refresh rate. You get an HDMI cable too, even though I didn't see it being mentioned in the product page. I am fully satisfied after buying such affordable and budget range Full HD LED Monitor.",5
"Colour, brightness, contrast are amazing. But the design of the stand could have been better. It starts shaking even with slight vibrations on the desk. Overall decent product with this price range.",4
"Don't think to much, just go and buy. If you are confused about 22 inch and 24 inch then this will be best option for you.
Even I was confused while going to purchase 22 and 24, finally decided to take this one and fully satisfied with the product.
You can use this monitor for multipurpose as I am using with my lappy and amazon fire stick.",5
"Got it for 6.75k during prime sale. Everything is perfect.
Few minor misses though
- No height or tilt adjustment

- Ports could have been placed vertical to save space.",5
"I got this product while searching for led TV and most positive reviews from customers, but had little disappointment not having inbuilt speaker at all. Still I didn't return it, all because of its true picture color and
clarity which tempts me to stay with it. Very comfortable and relaxing experience for eyes. I'm writing this review after 2 and half month of purchase. I'm much happy now, thanks Amazon!",4
"Excellent connectivity options, good color reproduction and features. ideal size for using with laptop. Makes viewing PPTs and Excel files a breeze.",5
"It's a decent mid-range gaming monitor with refresh rate up to 75hz. You don't need AMD graphics to get the free sync, it works just fine with Nvidia. it's a good product for someone who's into casual gaming. the only con with the product is its Stand, it might take up your desk space if you got a small desk but overall it's a decent monitor for entry-level gaming.",4
"Monitor is good, nice picture and colour however there is no tilt. Not a fan of the joy stick to change menu settings. Its a bit awkward to use. But once set no worries. The power button should have been a stand alone button and not interconnrcted with the menu settings joystick. The arc stand is quite sturdy, monitor stays steady. Got it at a good price. Delivery was good, well packaged, recieved brand new product. If it wasn't for the joy stick and power button I would have given it a 5.",4

"I bought this monitor two years ago, its LCD panel started flickering and stopped working, took it to the service center and he replaced the panel and again after 5 or 6 months later its replaced panel stopped working. Thank god it has three years warranty, going to ask for repair if they will then I will change the 2 stars to 5 stars because except this drama everything is fine with the monitor",1
"Been using for two weeks with my laptop via HDMI. NO Issues faced except when you plug in headphones directly to the monitor. There is some disturbance in background which becomes irritating. This can be remedied by not using headphone jack of the monitor at all. Also when you plug in both D-sub and HDMI, it takes time to detect the input and prefers D-sub over hdmi automatically which is problematic.",4
ONE OF THE BEST MONITOR UNDER 10000 AND THIS MONITOR HAVE MORE FEATURES THAN ANY OTHER MONITOR AND I LOVE THE LOOK OF MONITOR JUST READ FEATURES SPECIFIC OF THIS MONITOR U WILL KNOW ABOUT THIS MORE YESS AND THIS MONITOR HAVE UPTO 75 HZ REFRESH RATE BUT IN SPECIFICATIONS ITS WRITTEN 60HZ . YESS ITS TRUE. IF U DON'T BELIEVE THEN CHECK THIS MODEL ON FLIPKART IT THERE,5
"Screen very much meets the need of Office workstation screen. With more usage, most of the other benefits will be
very useful.

I was even expecting the bottom holder and backside also to be matt finish.
Which was the case when I was looked at the photos in amazon but when it was delivered it is not matt finish.",5
"Excellent Monitor under the price of 10k. Ive compared the monitors from acer,hp and samsung in this price range but this is the best one among all, interms of picture quality and connectivity.Extremely satisfied with the product.This monitor also supports freeesync and 75Hz refresh rate if you have an AMD graphic card.Product arrived in excellent packaging thanks to the seller.",5
"I love how easy to use this monitor is. From unboxing to using, it took perhaps 10 minutes to set up. The picture quality is great, as is the design of the monitor itself.",5
"Using this from last 1 month, haven't found any issues yet. I connect my ps4 and laptop with this and have no issue using it for 10-11 hours everyday. It would have been better if there were 2 hdmi ports. This is almost bezeless, so it ends up taking very less space.",4
"Very good for working from home application .. Good resolution, color mix and brightess. But while playing games at high fpv, it gets a bit choppy. I am not sure whether it is due to the monitor or the docking station I am using, the games with same settings on my laptop are not choppy. Hence I would give it 4.5 stars out of 5.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 It is one of the best gaming monitors u can see in market. I bugged it for 7399 in sale if you are it tight budget then highly consider it, But if not the u should consider other for high end gaming. I was on tight budget therefore I buyed. But still love it",5
"- Best 1080p monitor at this price range.
- Has VESA mounts.

Cons:

"Dosto agar aap Normal gaming karna chahat ho to isse badiya monitor koi bhi nhi h. picture quality very sharp hai. 50 % brightness enough hai dark or ujale me.agar app 100% brightness set karog to ""ips glow"" dakhan ko milagaa jis log "" backlight bleeding "" kahte hai.75hz refresh time, free sys support.",5
Screen resolution is good. HDMI cable recommended between PC and monitor as standard VGA cable generates shadows on the screen. Otherwise shielded VGA cable like that from Blue Rigger to be used for optimum display.,5
"Picture quality is medium, not impressive. My laptop panel gives more clarity than monitor. Sound does not work on windows 10 may update. It's a nightmare to manage if you are having dual monitor setup and work through night.",4
Just awesome product. using last 1.5 month the picture quality and the additional hz make this montion best in this price. As a gaming when hz overclock it did a great job in cinema & movie mode the picture quality amziing in this price tag.,5
"There is a technical defect in the Screen ie LED Panel the top and right edge shows the white halo on the screen. Initiated the return. Though Service of amazon is good , also the Particular LG model is good but I am having issue with the Device sent to me so returning it , and ordering again the same model may be from the different seller this time.",1
"I bought this during COVID time as I needed a monitor for WFH purposes. This is an extremely budget friendly IPS-Panelled Monitor. A 22"" monitor at this price range is a steal-deal. I have used it for 3 months now & there're no issues. All the various screen settings help you save your eyes from UV rays too.",5
"In the beginning, when i started using it, it felt as if the color accuracy was not on point. The black looked faded. But after going through the settings and switching the black level to low, and black stabilizer at 50, the display worked just like i wanted it to. Great Buy!",5
itz really good. at first i connect it with my set top box and started waching tv .i used hdmi cable directely .no need of tv tuner card.itz rocked. viewing angle colour everything best. watched youtube video..the besttttt,5
Nice display but you feel color is not uniformly distributed at all the edges if some flat color is on-screen. Otherwise it is a good display with anti-flicker technology which protects the eyes. Colors are warm and accurate. Overall a good display but could have been better.,4
"Premium Quality product . The power saving mode and other modes of viewing are really helpful based on the activity youre seeking to do. The screen is top notch and produces FHD resolution with ease . The packaging was done carefully and the product came in good hands . Been almost 4 months since purchase and I've faced no problems whatsoever . Setting up the device is also really easy and quick , though since the fitting is very perfect , its quite hard to disassemble it",5
"Monitor is worth the price. Some white color bleeding but cosidering overall it is fine. It consume much less power and works very well with HDMI.

I would definately recommend it.",4
Trust me guys I did a lot of research before buying this Monitor. It wasn't easy as I hadd to look for many features and aspects from all brands in the same range. Bought this during Great Indian Festival and loving this product.,5
"Bought it 20 days ago.
Half of the monitor blacked out.
Do not buy.
Have written to LG service.",1
"No screen bleeding.
Just go for it without second thought because i already watched tons of video and this is only king in this segment also color is so nice.
Just don't change contrast and blwck level or other thing cause company calibration is already best(u can reset to company calibration if u can't fix i usually want deep black but endup mixing light black and pure black.)",5
"Product is good as per it's value. Also amazon service is also good I got detected piece 1st time but within 12hrs I got the new piece. That was really impressive.

As per user manual I'm not getting all the items which is listed in the user manual guide. There are 2 wires are missing in both orders. I attached the image in which I marked down what I got from the box and what is missing in the box.",4
"The screen flickers and although amazon claims to have a 10 day return policy, it does not allows for the screen to be returned.",3
"I chose LG over Sony and Samsung. Please justify my choice.
Quality and display looks good, easy installation. Did it myself. Deducted 1star as they dint provide VGA cable while other monitors provide it in package.
PS: this monitor is for daily use. Not recommended for gaming.",4
"Third class product and poor after sales service . LG service engineer responce pathetic.

I never purchase any thinking from Amazon and never prefer LG product.",1
Close ur eyes and buy ..this is the the best monitor in this price ..but for gaming its worst ..40ms min during gameplay like valorant ..and 75hz is available if on free sync.colour accuracy is grt,5
"Hi all, please do not buy this product first this monitor is fixed it cannot be tilted when called for return Amazon so called experts said u should read description and return policy and denied return or replace.
Any deal of the day especially electronics in Amazon do not buy. Both amazon and manufacturers are cheating without giving right details of products",1
"Picture quality is too good... But the body looks like ordinary plastic material, due to which leave a scratch when i wiped the dust. I had used LG LCD monitor earlier when compared with that.. this quality wud hv been better.",5
This monitor is a great add-on for those working-from-home on their laptops for long hours. The screen size and picture quality minimize the strain on the eyes while spending hours coding and debugging.,4
"Till now this is the best led monitor I have used , not mentioning the brands I have used but they are nothing in comparison to this , the best led monitor in this range . Just go for it.",5
"Writing review after few days of using it. I have loved it so far because of the HD clarity as I am using it mostly for my office work. Have tried running videos and no doubt this piece is HD. The delivery packaging was intact and superb. The monitor comes with HDMI cable, stand and power plug.",5
"This is the best quality monitor available in the market under Rs. 10,000 till date. I've been using it for 1 month and the performance is very satisfactory till date.",5
First thanks to Amazon for fast delivery of the product and the LG monitor is very good at this price point because it has 75hz refresh rate that is good for gaming and it also has LG on screen software which is to control the brightness for individual applications and the last thing that it is a IPS display which provides 179. 0 degree wide angle.,5
Pathetic panel viewing angle are too bad when dark scene display totally reflect picture quality is too bad believe me or not why to this is happen to my moniter.... The only reason for buying this monitor seen on YouTube lot of people recamened.... Poor decisions.... Bad too bad,1
Picture quality is good. Also on screen control is really amazing. At the same time height is not adjustable and also base stand is not properly balancing sometimes Monitor is not grip with this stand,4
"It is a great panel with fantastic colour reproduction, good stand and look with thin bezels, but price should be around 8k, it is worth paying 1k more than cheaper moniyors.",4
"Good display, probably best under 10k in IPS category.

Pros
-----
Lots of settings in the menu.
Goes up to 75Hz, which is a noticeable improvement over the usual 60Hz.
Bezels are very thin.

Cons
-------
Viewing angles are not that great.
Blacks are not that deep (True for any IPS panel)",5
The reason i am giving it 4 stars is that the hdmi cable the comes free with the monitor does not support HDCP whereas the monitor itself supports it. That means Amazon Prime/Netflix wont play videos in HD format. After replacing the hdmi cable with one from Amazon Basics i was able to get HD video.,4
"Was not expecting HDMi cable but good that I recieved it.
Picture quality seems to be good so far.
Cons I noticed till now,
-you might feel screen is tilting to front side slightly.
-Also screen is getting heated and that is something you won't want when monitor is too close to you.",4
Overall a very good purchase in ips led monitor picture quality is very sharp and clear refre5 rate is good but a little cons is that there is a light bulry glowing in the top of the led i don't find the reason of this i have use vga cable but this is hdmi best support so don't know but good quality in this price...,4
There is nothing to dislike about. It was an amazing product. Guys one more thing I bought this product for 8500Rs so please wait for till the sale time. This product rate often fluctuates but please be patient don't go for Samsung curve display it doesn't have 75Hz refresh rate like this one has. It also offers 4 holes for wall mount. Good IPS display and also good viewing angles. It also has Amd free sync.,5
"If you want a budget gaming monitor, it's for you. It has 75hz display which is great at this price point. The picture quality is awesome. You can do both Gaming and Productivity tasks like Photoshop or watch movies with this monitor. I got it for around Rs.7200 from sale. If you're buying this monitor, wait for Amazon sale. You'll get a great deal.",5
"I didn't get the chance to rate the product feature because I received a broken monitor, raised a complaint to replace it, but still no one came to pick the broken monitor, waiting for more than 10 days, very disappointed with no action taking place :(",1
Everything thing was good but after some days while running it started burning and with in 2dys display was gone black and stopped working. Lg has best customer care service with fraud technications they didnt even care or didnt even respond.,1
Worst product i have ever used. My monitor damaged within 10 months and there is no proper service or response from LG even after 10 days I have complained. So many lines are appearing on the screen with many colors and display will be blinging always. I am a designer and getting too much difficulties with my work. Don't by this product.,1
Very good quality monitor.. value for money. Go for it.,5
"LG monitor quality is good but stand quality to support monitor can be better.
The HDMI cable was defected so I have to bought separately as LG team refuse to provide replacement of HDMI cable",3
"Super picture quality. I have Sony Bravia led ask both picture quality looks similar
It as 3.5mm output for speaker you can use it connecting speaker and head phones.

Also Chromecast, Connects to laptop well and set top box HDMI adapter works well

You can use it as an TV also",5
This monitor is awesome in this price range. Purchased for Rs.6999/- during offer period. It is the best budget monitor. Dont hesitate. Go for it.,5
There's some bleeding on top bezel sides but thats only 5 percent. You cant even notice that without noticing closely best monitor for watching movies 75hz also works with nvidia gpu cards. The matte finish is good but if you have to clean the screen its catches some stains but thats not that much visible.,5
"Very sharp display.
Earlier i used to esit on my laptop's TN panel and after i used this monitor there is just no going back.
Colours are vivid and accurate , slightly warmer in tone and asolutely sharp.
Setup was a breeze and the stand is reasonably sturdy too.
Slim in design and sleek in looks.
Overall more than i expected..",5
"The monitor from LG is very good. For gaming not yet fully checked, but picture quality is sharp and crystal clear. The screen is IPS panel, so it has nice anti glare properties. Wonderful monitor in just 7k.",5
"Good product everything is perfect and it's a perfect monitor in that budget .
But the packing is very bad lg packing is good but the seller is not packed it properly
Worst packing .seller is not provided any protection for monitor package",5
"I bought this in May 2020.
Overall is a good monitor.
It is silly to see there is no DVI cable or a Display Port Cable supplied with the monitor.",4
"Best Monitor under 10k price range. Picture quality is amazing.i used 19inch lcd monitor for nearly 10yrs. Now i bought this. The difference is awesomeü§©. My priority is not gaming. So response time and refresh rate is ok for me.
I will update my review if i find any issues",5
"Seems to be a good one but unfortunately I had to return mine due to backlight bleed issues. So buyers please beware of this.
Couldn't return on the same day as delivery and so I did not get a replacement but only got a refund.
I liked it overall though and i may order this if the sale offer price (of 7k!) comes again.",3
"Value for money!

It is not one of the best monitor under 10k, i can say it is the best! The picture quality is super,colour is nice & the ips panel is decent at this price point. I am not facing any screen issue right now! Overall you can buy it without thinking! Thank you LG & Amazon.",4
I used this LED Screen for over 2 months now. HDMI input works awesome on this. Viewing angle is 178 degrees as confirmed by LG. Product is commendable.,5
"this the best monitor u can get which has freesync in this budget, there are better ips panels out there but they are priced higher, if you are only looking for gaming and normal office work or just watching videos go for it,
If youre into video editing or photo editing gor for something better",4
Utterly disappointed with the product. After using first 11 days the right side of the display turned dark. Little google search give me an impression that it's a backlight bleeding issue. Now 13 days return policy is over. Not sure what shall do with it. A Monitor is very important to me for work from home now.,1
"Try to avoid the seller for this product. They don't even test the product's condition before shipping.
Mine arrived with a defective screen with right side lcd defective so it's all black.
I have requested a replacement. Let's see how it goes.",1
"Bought this monitor to work with Laptop as I need to see multiple files while working.
Display quality is good and sizw is perfect for my usage.

1 item i have returned and replaced due to some vertical line shown in display . And replaced item also have issues. That display have dead pixels.,1
It's a good Monitor and one can buy it from Appario Retail without any apprehension or dout. Buy any thing if seller is Appario or Cloudtel.,5
"I am reviewing it after 2 month's i guess...and this moniter is working just great no issues afterall..
If you are looking for a 22inch moniter that has a bezzelless design and comes with full hd resolution i.e 1920√ó1080 you should go for it...and it also comes with amd freesync as wellüî•üíØ",5
"Not able to understand the extremely complex stand assembling and disassembling. Every time I have to remove its stand for walmont, it takes hrs to understand how to do that. After paying so much of money why we ned to fight to just remove a stand.",1
Picture quality and brightness and all features are excellent accept screen size looking too small when hang on wall. that why I give 4star comparing it's high price..,4
"It's a really good quality build display from LG for daily computer usage. It comes with HDMI port only, however available interfaces are VGA, DVI and HDMI. Though price is quite high but satisfied with product build quality and output.",5
"Full HD IPS LED backlight looks good
Has three ports for display HDMI, VGA, DVI,
At this price point
No package issue
Nicely package display can't be damage
Anti glare works good
Bezel less display looks great
And freesync if you use AMD processor
Stability of stand is ok",5

Useful tip: For controls like brightness, connect to laptop and then long press the monitor power button and you will see the menu option. Follow the arrows.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Do not buy.

Edit:
After using this monitor for about 2.5 years. I am having horizontal lines across the top half of the monitor...clarity is not good as before. This is sad as I had better expectations from LG. Their display panels are generally good.",4

"Damaged monitor received. Visible scratches in the back and broken led screen!
Filed for a replacement and hopefully a new one is received soon.",1
"Upgrading after my 7yrs old lg monitor died :( . Really happy that i choose this over Hp22es. Main reason to do that is after sale service of LG is really good in my area. Excellent monitor for gaming . Very bright screen,",5
"The design and the price is really good. I disabled freesync because I could see flickering. Had to adjust settings so that light colors weren't over bright. It would have been better if it could detect the source when I switch off my console and start my pc. There is some back light bleed in the corners which can become worse in dark scenes if I move to either sides too much which cancels out the viewing angle advantage of IPS.

I love the design. Everyone keeps asking me why I chose 22 instead of the 24 inch. I need at least 100 ppi. I guess others don't give much importance to details in games, movies and text.

I dont like buying monitors because they aren't improving. Even if I get an expensive one, there will be problems that I notice and I feel horrible. But this price is good. I wasted hours searching online trying to justify buying an expensive one. I don't know if I am missing something. If it was some other component inside my pc, it would have been easy to make a decision about the budget.",4
"Specifications:-
1. 16:9 full HD 1920*1080p Display

One More Thing It's Also A Gaming Monitor,
Overall Killer Monitor,
Kudos To LG/üòò/üòò/üòò/üòâ",5
"I generally love LG products. I have a TV, a refrigerator, a microwave and two phones from LG in our house right now... so I'm sorry to say this: the one time that I have needed it so far, LG's warranty service sucks. Don't buy their products... They just don't want to fix/maintain them.

While the product worked, it was awesome... Great picture quality, no flicker. It konked out just 1 short month after purchase.

I've been going back and forth with their support team for the last *21 days* and I do not have a solution. A beautiful, non-functional monitor taking up table space. I'm glad I still can rely on my trusty old Dell monitor for now.

Don't buy this monitor. The after sale customer service is non-existent.

--
An update: After a month and a week, LG support came through. The monitor was replaced and things are right in the world once more. Boy was that frusturating!

I updated my rating to 3 stars. The monitor itself is excellent, the service experience was not too great. I hope it's a one time thing.",3
"I received the monitor in one day thanks to Prime delivery. Amazon packaging was fine but LG did not pack the included CD properly. The CD was kept without cover with other items and was already broken when I opened the box. However the CD is not important as LG software can be downloaded from their website so I did not consider that for rating this monitor. There is a HDMI cable included in the box. No drivers are required to use the monitor and you can simple plug it in and turn it on.

At first I didn't know how to turn the monitor on. There did not seem to be any buttons on the sides of the monitor which left me puzzled. Then I found a single hidden whitish-color button at the bottom of the monitor which is used for all the controls. It is not visible unless you turn the monitor upside down and see. This single button can be used for changing all the settings by moving the button left, right, forward or back and it works well.

The ports available are good. You have a HDMI port, DVI-D, D-SUB IN and an audio-out AUX port which is quite useful if you want to connect chromecast to the monitor to watch Netflix or Youtube. There are no inbuilt speakers so you have to connect speakers to the monitor if you are using chromecast or amazon fire stick.

The display quality and color quality of the monitor are good. The viewing angles are great. However my biggest complaint is the brightness. The default brightness is set to 100 which is way too bright. I had to set the brightness to 0(yes, zero) for it to be comfortable. Even then it is a little too bright and there is little too much backlit which makes black colours look lighter. I do not like how black is represented in this monitor. There is also slight backlight bleed on the bottom left and especially right side which is noticeable if the background is full black.

I have not experienced AMD free sync feature as I use an Nvidia GPU so I cannot comment about that but gameplay is mostly smooth. I will be getting a new AMD GPU next month so I will update my review about free sync after that.

Overall this is a great monitor with lots of good ports and features for the price if you don't mind the brightness and a little backlight bleed on the sides.

EDIT:
After changing some settings and adjusting black levels, the black color is much better now and there is not too much light.",5
"yestereday i received this product, its amazing Monitor, Previously i used Samsung Syncmaster 943 its TN Panel, I Am not hardcore gamer but i like to play video game 2-3 hours, Initially i thourght that ips monitor are not good for gaming, but this monitor change by thinking.
its Amazing monitor, Colors are superb.

Only drawback is that its stand, it is some how sheky, if You dont have stable desk. but i overcame that difficulty by putting two object at the corner of Monitor",5
"i purchased this monitor after comparing many models like HP 22es, Dell S2216H, BenQ GW2470H. on comparing with these monitor i found following details

HP 22es
it has ips matte screen but Response time 14 ms gray to gray so cant use for fast gaming

Dell S2216H
it has glossy ips screen only suitable for watching cinema from long distance. if you use it for reading news paper, graphic designing more than 1 hour cause eye stain and may cause to decrease our vision. in my past i have dell S2240L monitor which has ""Glossy with Low-Haze 3H"" screen it caused to reduce my vision. Dell have no paid service for their monitor and also unavailability of spare you cant use it after warranty period (up to 3 year only)

BenQ GW2470H
it has VA panel, color reproduction very less as compare to IPS panel

Advantages of LG 22MP68VQ over other monitors
1 : Main advantage is its matte screen, you can use it without any eye strain.
2 : Refresh rate 75 Hz, response time 5ms, and AMD FreeSync is good for fast gaming.
3 : It is a EPEAT Gold certified monitor (Gold-rated products meet all the required criteria plus at least 75% of the optional criteria ) most of other brands has only EPEAT silver (Silver-rated products meet all the required criteria plus at least 50% of the optional criteria).
4 : LG offers free and paid services for their monitor so that you can use it after completing warranty too.
5 : OnScreen Control software good for setting different brightness and contrast level for different software like internet explorer and media players (for reading purpose contrast and brightness should be less compare to watching movies ) it automatically activate when we start a software like media player and Ms office
6 : Some of them complaint about its stand on comparing with dell and hp monitor it has a good study stand (surface contact area more than compare to dell and hp) you can see it in the image.

to get best visual effect u should install driver software from lg website

Dell and HP good brand in laptop but in monitor you should think about lg too",5
"This is my first 1080p display, very pleased with the extra space.
Colors are good, blacks not perfect but good for the price. AMD Freesync is also there.
Very bright. No backlight bleeding.
Bezels are very small, makes this look very premium.
Settings menus are perfect and the joystick is brilliant. Can even turn off the power LED.
The stand is also very nice and angle adjustment is easy. It is stable and will only wobble under exceptional force.
Cords are of sufficient length. I got HDMI and the adapter with attached cord.
The back has DVI, D-sub and HDMI. There is a 3.5mm jack also.",5
Best budget friendly monitor. 5ms response rate and 75hz display are the eye catching specs here and beleive me its worth every penny. The sharpness and details are great and synced with amd freesync its a charm. Keep in mind to control brightness and contrast settings from Nvidia‚Äôs control panel as default configs dont look that great.,5
"Initially I thought I made a mistake. There was too much light bleed. Even on minimum brightness the monitor had too much light. I thought of returning and on the day of pickup I changed my mind. I did some setting tweaking.

Brightness: 75
Contrast: 75
Picture mode: Custom
-Black level: Low
-Black stabilizer: 50
Color adjust:
-Gamma: Gamma1
Red:40
Green: 50
Blue: 50

Important: Then do Windows display calibration: Get a good grey by reducing red for your liking.

After this I'm pretty happy with the display. Excellent FHD quality and very easy on the eyes.

There are some black issues. Viewing angles are not really great as you can see light bleed in some angles. Right side of the monitor is slightly (I'm a perfectionist) low in light. It's not an OLED display :) and under 10K this is a good buy.",4
"The experience was very good I bought it because it was a Freesync and a 22 was enough for me now I was pretty impressed.

Pros:
IPS Display (Colour is Really Good for this Price)
The Basic Interaction with Settings (It's basic and simple so you can sort stuff up quick)
Thin Bezzels (I play in Dark I barely notice the Bezzels actually)
Price (This is a very reasonable price for the stuff it came packed with)

Cons:
I have been using this monitor for 10 days I have started noticing a minor light bleed at the top left corner but you can barely notice it its like if you have turned of your console or pc and it has lost connection it would go into grey screen for power saving mode then you can notice the light bleed.

That's it actually I can't complain anything else it has all the things that a AVG user requires and that price is fantastic.

I would rate it a 4.5/5",4
"This is the best there is, here's why?
1. Superb picture quality and color reproduction.
2. Black light stablizer(which is very rare in this budget)
3. Freesync 75hz works with nVidia as well
5. Slim and bezels are minimal
6. Response times 2ms to 5ms
7. Speaker out

For gamers:
Black light stablizer can do wonders if you are a competitive gamer.
Also if you have a good GPU free sync is a noticeable improvement for fps and overall gameplay experience.",5
"Packaging:
Amazing packaging, covered with 9 plastic cushion, ensured that the product was okay.

Monitor:
Yipee! got an HDMI Cable supplied with it.

It's the best budget monitor:
-1080p Full HD (For 22"" 1080p is enough, although if you want Screen bigger than 24"" I would recommend 1440p)
-IPS: You can see from side angles too.
-Anti-glare
-60 Hz Refresh Rate normally
75 Hz on turning Freesync on, even on nVidia Graphics Card (although I haven't tested this feature yet). At this price, it's splendid.
-Very Good Menu system

Overall, just amazing product and awesome delivery earns a five star from me.",5
"Let us start with the in-box content. It comes with a manual, a driver CD (so you can use your mouse to navigate within the display settings), HDMI cable, Power Adapter, Stand and of course, the display itself. Physically, the display looks so elegant with its near bezel-less design and the 4 way stick to use monitor settings at the bottom illuminates the bottom of the monitor like a spot lite. Perfect for keeping your gamepad controllers (you can disable the light if you want to). The Arc stand looks awesome, provides good support so display doesn't wobble and doesn't take so much space as well. It also supports VESA mount so you can get 3rd party mounts for it that suits your taste better.

Coming to the ports available. This display supports HDMI 1.4a, DVI port, VGA port and a 3.5mm audio output jack so that you can connect your speakers to the monitor and it will use the audio via HDMI and output it to the 3.5mm jack. The display comes with the HDMI cable included.

This display has 75hz Refresh Rate and 5ms Grey-To-Grey response time. That's certainly good for an IPS panel, most of the other display in this price range are either 60hz IPS panel or 1ms TN panel. As you all know, TN panel lack the colour accuracy that IPS has to offer. The display out of the box will suit anyone's need but to get the best out of it, tinker with the settings a bit to find something that suits you best. The best thing about this display which prompted me to buy it was the inclusion of FreeSync. I own a FreeSync compatible AMD GPU and the FreeSync is heavenly. It automatically adjusts the display's refresh rate to match the FPS so it can eliminate stuttering by sudden FPS drop or tearing getting more FPS than Refresh Rate. It's something you need to see for yourself to realize how smooth and fluidic the game plays on this display. The display supports 40hz to 75hz of FreeSync range. The blacks are deep, display itself is bright enough to be used in any scenario. Colour spectrum is amazing. I have set same wallpaper on a laptop with 1080p IPS panel (Lenovo Legion Y520) and on this monitor. On this monitor, the wallpaper had a gradient type look to it, starting from Navy Blue and slowly transition to Cyan where as on the laptop which has an IPS display itself just looked like a flat dark blue colour. There were areas which were completely blank on the laptop screen but showed details like rocks on this display. It's amazing how good it looks!

Cons - The stand doesn't allow for vertical height adjustment so you'll need to change your chair height rather than display height.
The HDMI 1.4a standard is ""technically"" capable of delivering enough bandwidth for 1080p 120hz monitors but it's not officially supported hence if you try to overclock the monitor via CRU (yes you can overclock the monitors too) then the display just says unsupported input so you can't really overclock this monitor. It will stay at 1080p 75hz. You can however modify the FreeSync range from default 40hz-75hz to anything, I have mine set to 20hz to 75hz

Overall - I think this display looks the best in the price range with some good specs to back it up with, 1920x1080 @ 75hz and FreeSync with good colour gamut coverage, good stand and most of all, all this within 10,000. It will not disappoint you. Just buy it.",5
"This is hands down the best monitor under 12k. Especially for gaming.
-it has 1080P full HD screen.
-This has an IPS panel which is the best panel for colour reproduction.
-It has 75hz Refresh Rate
-It has 5ms of response time(im not sure)
-it has AMD freesync technology that is very useful in gaming
-it has black stabilizer which helps you in dark areas of games.
-it has 1hdmi port and 1VGA port on the back.
What more can you ask under 12k price? Just go for it.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Very beautiful and awesome product from LG under 10000 rupees.i got this monitor in 8300rs from freedom sale offer. I suggest you to buy this monitor, i have gone through many videos and reviews and everyone supported to buy this monitor. This monitor have freesync technology which helps to maintain frame rate while playing games or working graphic designing. Very good picture quality it is smooth to watch from all sides.
NOTE:the freesync only work with HDMI cable And only with Amd graphic cards with free sync technology launched after 2015.
The screen doesn't not rotate vertically.",5
"I have come from a laptop with 768 resolution screen. So this display is the first eye üç¨ for me.

The bezels are very slim which gives it a premium feel. Even the body does not feel that cheap.

An hdmi cable is included.

It has a good looking metalic base which does the job.
But the display does wobble while doing heavy stuff on the desk. If you are a person who has/likes to use his/her keyboard roughly then i would suggest you grab a better base.

The audio pass through is just there... But does not have good quality. I would recommend you ro use youe PCs audio port for better quality. But regardlesa it's there.

The navigation is damn easy and just takes a couple of steps to learn.

The diaplay itself is preety good as it is an IPS display. The only problem i had was it does not have a high contrast ratio but no monitor has this good display at this price so no deal breaker. Great for gaming (1080p 60fps) and media consumption.

The free sync option is great to have. That means you can have an AMD graphics card and get smooth gameplay even on demanding titles. I have an nvidea graphics card so i am unable to test it.

Great for the price... Recommend it...",5
"Pros:
Supports AMD Free sync
75 Hz refresh rate
Anti - glare matte display
Features like Black Stabilizer, Super resolution +,Split screen etc
Thin Bezels and very good Colours.

Cons :
No inbuilt speakers
It comes with VGA cable instead of HDMI Cable (No one should use VGA in 2016)

Conclusion : Best full HD monitor under ‚Çπ 10,000 (better than Dell S2216h in my opinion), particularly for gaming.

Note : Free sync is only supported with AMD graphics cards but 75 Hz refresh rate works with all of the graphics cards (with HDMI only).",5
"Undoubtedly the best monitor one can get under 10k right now!
Good viewing angles,Nice bezel-less design.
Probably the best monitor under 10k :-
as it provides a better response time than the HP es22 and a better panel than dell s2216h(its only competitors).
Overall a wonderful pick at 9.3k with no drawbacks just clean quality :D.
This monitor comes with VGA and HDMI port (Hdmi cable in included inside the box)
(Exact model number is LG 22MP68VQ-P)
Idk y amazon skips on that ""-P"" but well JUST GO FOR IT! :D",5
"My Gpu is Amd rx 480 8gb . So this monitor have AMD Freesync features , So i get 75 fps in 1080 full hd resolution. This is the best budget monitor for a Gamer.",5
"Very nice LED too bad i received a piece with pixel dead.
Amazon was good in taking back my product.

Ordered it from somewhere else and working great since past 3 months.
This is best in range below 8000.
Has all 3 inputs (VGA, DVI &HDMI), so no worries if your computer does not have HDMI.
IPS screen is great with good viewing angles.

Don't buy this if you want to wall mount it.
Also this monitor cannot be tilted.",5
"I am using this product from 10 days it best for gaming
very good product
Display 10/10
Audio output is 15/10
Colour calibration 9/10
Viewing angles 10/10
Stand 3/10 poor shaking for 2 speed sealing fan air
It very light weight bezels are not so thin shown in picture
Any one can bay it best value for money",5
"Purchased this based on the reviews and considering this is a Feb 2016 model.
Shipping was fast. No HDMI cable provided.
But did NOT work with the Blue Rigger hdmi cable (hdmi to hdmi) which I had purchased exclusively for this. Only could make it work with thunderbolt-hdmi adapter and/or vga. (However the Mac works fine with hdmi-hdmi with another monitor.)

Was almost about to return this model, when we received another monitor from Dell. We then tried with the Dell-provided HDMI cable and luckily this monitor worked! This monitor also has a small black border around it and the screen does not extend till the edge.
Would recommend the 21.5 Dell monitor instead of this one.",3
"I bought a new monitor because I wanted a Full HD monitor. But it is worst FHD monitor I've seen. The resolution is pathetic. I can see all dots when text is displayed. The very purpose was to lessen strain on my eyes but it was same as my previous LG LCD monitor.
Feeling cheated.",1
"I have Sapphire RX 460 2GDDR5 which means I needed a FreeSync capable monitor which means Tearing Free Experience.
Never used an IPS monitor before but the difference is day n night as compared to a TN panel monitor.
I love playing games on it and doing video editing using Adobe Premiere.
Best 1080p Budget Gaming Monitor Ever.
Beautiful looks because of almost bezel less panel.
Last but not the least this monitor came with HDMI cable so I was tension free about having to purchase one separately.",5
"One of the best monitor I have used. Its slim, on screen control (works only with HDMI, not with VGA) are awesome.
Even for high frame rate games also it is just awesome. Viewing angels are very good, only issue is the tilt the screen. You can't tilt the screen much and also not able to adjust height. Else this is the best FHD monitor and 22"" size is perfect for home use.",5
"have been using it for past 4 months. display is truly fantastic, gives almost true colors. no lag, no flicklering while playing games at full hd. hers a few screenshots when running at full 120 fps 1080p display.",5
If you want to buy an IPS monitor which will be good for both gaming and watching movies...Go for this one.... I'm using this regularly for about 4-5 hrs with PS4 and 2 hr as desktop monitor for the past 7 months...Never experienced any problem...Don't go for negative reviews...Just Buy,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I bought this monitor for my PS4 and i have to tell you guys that this monitor have super resolution+ comes with AMD Freesync and you'll get premium HDMI cable with it and screen software dvd and this monitor works great for me just don't look out for negative comments go for it because all the people who is having issues is about their delivery experience and not about monitor so if you're confused between lg and dell go for lg and if you're are fan of glassy screen type then go for dell and I've attached a uncharted 4 video clip where you can see the colour gammut which is great by this monitor that's all folks.",5
"Previously I had 21.5' LED backlit monitor, from the moment I switched to this one, I can feel the difference. I think the best feature of this monitor is that the colors are almost accurately corrected. I have tested it with my PS4 slim and it's working fine. Still waiting to test freesync feature. The sound via HDMI is okeish.

Pros
Almost Bezel less
IPS panel with good color accuracy
Great viewing angles
Hdmi sound o/p
Easy menu control with mouse
Freesync via HDMI

Cons
Doesn't have VESA mount

Go for this one guys.",4
Built with style but not as solid as expected. Screen is beautiful. Colour reproduction is not so appealing for me comparing my old dell ultrasharp. Power consumption is low. Less bulky compact. Hdmi and dvid inputs. Did not use audio out. Single bottom button menu operation is clever. Recommended for programming and general office use. Not for graphics,3
"probably the best IPS full hd display at this rate.
no complaints. could have been better if it comes with a height adjustable, stand",5
"after using this monitor for 2 years i am giving this review.i am a movie person i liked it a lot because of great picture quality compared to delll monitor , i compared side by side LG lot better and i like different colour modes and settings.this is a fantastic monitor in this price range.",5
"Kudos to Amazon for a quick delivery. The product was same as described in the description.
Although the correct model number is 22MP68VQ-P as described on LG's website. I already own a Dell S2240L and my review is based on by comparing both these models.
* It's is slightly forward tilted, so my dual setup Monitor looks slightly out of sync.
* Screen is on the cooler side and the white looks very bright.
* Screen is matte, so there are no reflections when compared to my Dell.
* Bezels are very slim and monitor looks absolutely gorgoeous.
* I have attached a sample photo of both the monitor with same web page. Rest is for you to decide now .",5
"Good side :
1. it has good screen quality with nice colors.
Bad :
1. it doesn't have adjustable stand which is not very easy to use.
2. it doesn't allow to tilt the screen which makes it little difficult to use.
3. LG should have considered ergonomics of the product along with the quality.",3
"Backlight bleeding in the corners. Avoid this monitor, so much disappointed with LG.",1
"Being with a 15"" laptop screen over a long time, moved to this amazing 22"" monitor. The experience is very good with this wonderful monitor. The actual model is LG 22MP68VQ-P. Maybe the best monitor at this price range with thin bezel, best ever IPS matt Display. Monitor provides a premium look and feel.
Package comes with Power Cord and HDMI cable. It has lots of options at the back like VGA, HDMI, DVI for video and also supports a 3.5mm audio jack.",4
"A perfect general purpose monitor. Seller cloudtail.
Pros: FHD IPS screen, sleek design, compatible with HDMI, DVI, VGA. I even got HDMI cable in the box.

CONS : Monitor shakes due to stand but not a deal breaker. You need to spend time to adjust monitor settings because default settings are not good.",5
Its an excellent moniter i ever had,4
Good product. Best for full hd gaming and movie. Various picture modes are available regarding to necessity. Low wattage consumption; only 17 watts.,4
"Using this LED from last 1 year and its superb experience in using this IPS LED. It has an Audio-In jack for headphones but not inbuilt speakers, I'd be more happy if this LED came up with inbuilt speakers like in DELL IPS LED 22"" but overall its nice experience with this slim LED !",5
LG Monitor screen found damaged after unboxing,1
"Display on this monitor is pretty good . I use it for my work and the performance is quite good.
One major disadvantage is that monitor‚Äôs height is not adjustable and there is also no sideways movement as well. Gave me a nechache the first day . Had to buy a monitor stand to increase the height . Now all good !!!",3
"Not at all happy with the delivery. Ordered prime delivery and received product after 4 whole days.
Monitor is as expected, as specified in specifications. Good monitor.",2
"Item is good and got it before the delivery date. Everything is fine but there is a slight white bleeding can see from the corners in full black screen. This can't be easily identified. But it's not a big problem for me.

Overall the product is super cool. I got it in Prime Day Offer for 7.7k

It's worth money.",4
Amazing picture quality. Good colour reproduction. The bezels are quite thin. The bundled software lets you automatically switch colour modes based on the program that is running. Build quality is very good too.,5

but talking about the product it is very good but a little high in its price segment
very good and colorful ips panel resolution 1920 x 1080 and feature
high contrast
black stabilizer
AMD freesync
flicker free
the slim bezel display and arcline stand give it more premium look
but it is a bit shaky due to its stand design but it is manageable if u have a sturdy table.
i have confusion between dell s2216h and LG 22MP68vq-p but i go for lg because of its anti glare display because i have to use it most of the time in bright light condition so anti glare display are a bit annoying.

i am giving it four star for its value for money
and not giving 1 star for its shaky design and a little high-priced and also for its wrong specification .",4

Good,3

"Okay so i got this monitor just for amd freesync, if you don't have an AMD gpu you are better off buying something else. So initially my laptop was quite old and i used a vga cable, the picture was ok and i thought that slight bluriness was due to the vga cable.As I had just finished building my gaming rig. I noticed that this monitor has an hdmi problem. It does not work with your hdmi port from a laptop tablet etc. I called in lg customer care and they told me that i have to pay 500 bucks plus cost of its motherboard in order to get it fixed on warranty. I was shocked. I warned them about consumer court and slowly they came to their senses. I had everything on call recorder hence i was able to negotiate with these money mongers. Finally their representative came with a new board and replaced it, but here comes the surprise even the new board was defective and the monitor is still not accepting any hdmi input. They have promised to resolve the issue but its been more than a month and still they are ""working on it"". Their executive was clueless and made excuses everytime about the issue. I am fed up with this monitor. I would suggest you all to look somewhere else. This is not what you want.",2
"Extremely high purple/blue IPS glow. It has no blue light filter. In daylight it is still tolerable, but at night you have to lower the brightness. Even the minimum brightness is too high, so you lave to lower the contrast, which completely washes out the scene/texts. Please don't buy if you want a good viewing experience, particularly at night. Especially bad for reading, even in reading mode. The black text appears as purple. Reading mode does not reduce the blue light, rather jacks up the red and green (yellow). You can use custom settings to make it slightly more bearable, but it is impossible to live with this thing for the next 5 years. Even my old Samsung TN screen has better contrasts. All the online hype over IPS screens made me order this thing. Totally disappointed. Returned it. Please don't buy cheap IPS. If you want cheap monitor then buy TN or VA. If you want IPS monitor then buy an expensive one, preferably over Rs. 20,000/-. I have used expensive Dell IPS monitors at my office. They produce exceptionally good quality pictures.",1
"INTRODUCTION :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::
If you are looking for a great monitor, your search has ended. Without a doubt, it is the best budget gaming monitor . It is also the best monitor for video editing, movie watching and Internet browsing under 10,000 Rupees. And I will also try to explain, why it is better than its competitors, the Dell S2216H and HP 22ES, which are also awesome monitors under 10,000.

WHY THIS MONITOR IS INTERESTING :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Under the budget of 10,000,

a) It is among the very few monitors which are :

* 1) 21.5 inch (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, Benq RL2240HE, Samsung LS22E310HY/XL, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),
* 2) Full HD(Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),
* 3) IPS (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES,LG 22MP58VQ),
* 4) Matte screen with IPS panel (LG 22MP58VQ and Samsung LS19F350HNWXXL(Glossy with PLS panel) ) (others have either glossy screen with IPS panel or matte screen with VA or TN panel)

b) And is the only one which has :

* 1) Free-sync technology,
* 2) 75 Hz refresh rate(All other have 60 HZ)

Please write in comments, if I am missing any monitor in the above list, so that others can read it.

ABOUT BRAND :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::
LG makes some awesome products and they keeps providing cutting edge technology in its monitors. No wonder, we see them so much on youtube and other websites.

BASIC INFORMATION :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I will try to explain what these terms mean in brackets after the specifications.

* Size 55.88cm (22)
* Panel Type IPS (Best panel type for color reproduction)
* Color Gamut (CIE1976) 72% (Color gamut refers to the various levels of colors that can potentially be displayed by a device.)
* sRGB Coverage 86.1% (This is most common color gamut. Other are Adobe RGB and Photoshop RGB)
* Color Depth (Num of Colors) 16.7M colors (Most common color depth. 10 and 12 bit color depth is for serious graphic designers)
* Pixel Pitch (mm) 0.2915*0.2915 (Distance between centre of pixels to other centre of pixel. Lower the distance, sharper the image )
* Resolution 1920 x 1080
* Brightness(Typ.) 250cd/m2 (It's ok. Many other monitors offer the same brightness)
* Contrast Ratio(Original) 1000:1 (Here VA panels are better, which offer better contrast ratios of 3000:1 like Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM. Better contrast ratio means deeper blacks. But for IPS 1000:1 contrast ratio is common.)
* (DFC) Mega (LG's DFC is a meaningless number. Dynamic contrast means nothing, it's marketing jargon.)
* (GTG) 5ms (Its not great, but its good for gaming. For awesome 1 ms response time look at TN panels like Benq RL2240HE)
* Viewing Angle(CR‚â•10) 178/178 (One of the strong points of IPS panels is great viewing angles. No color distortion even if you look from very side)
* Surface Treatment Anti-Glare,3H (Matte screen is a must have, if you have lot of light in your room)
* Display interfaces D-Sub(VGA), DVI-D, HDMI (Many others have only two of these three display interfaces)
* Audio output Headphone Out (Audio quality was not good, and why would anyone connect headphones to monitors instead of their PCs)
* Maximum Power Consumption 17.6W
* Sleep Mode Power consumption Under 0.3W

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION :
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

* Also comes with cable holder, which is a detachable plastic part, that comes separately with the monitor and attaches itself to back of stand, and manages cables, so that you cannot see cables from front. It keeps things neat and managed.
* It is VESA mount compatible. Many budget monitors are not VESA mount compatible.
* Comes pre caliberated. Not many do. You get a printed 'color calibration factory report' with monitor inside box. You don't need to adjust anything by going into menu, if you don't want.
* Not all IPS are good but this really is and shows a lot better image than TN panels.
* You see sharper image on 22 inch 1080p screen, than 24 or 27 inch 1080p screen. As all three screens have same number of pixels, smaller size will have more pixel per inch than bigger screens.

BONUS INFORMATION :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I am really enjoying this monitor. If you like to have lots of features at low price and still want good quality product, this monitor is for you. Honestly I am waiting to see which monitor will come to dethrone this one, as the best budget monitor. I mean which monitor will be able to add more features than this one without increasing the price and still maintaining the quality.

I have many stories to tell, about my experience with this monitor. How I connected this with different PCs and laptops and how it interacted differently on them. Not going to bore you guys with details but a word of advice try to use this monitor over HDMI, as it works better and adds feature instead of VGA.

You also get OnScreen Control Software with this monitor, which I liked. Its simple to use. You don't have to control monitor settings from menu by using the joystick but you can do it from this monitor using your mouse easily. It lets you add display presets to different applications. And the presets will change automatically, when you switch to different applications. For example; if I add Reader preset to Microsoft Word and Cinema preset to VLC player, the brightness and contrast will go down whenever I switch to Word and will go up, whenever I switch to VLC.
You can also use screen split feature with one click from it. Screen splitting is that you can split your screen and look at two, three or four windows at a time on your screen. For example; I can look at chrome and word, side by side and I will not have to switch between them again and again, if I am doing work which needs both of these applications. Although, Windows 10 and some other free softwares like WinSplit and GridVista,offer split screen feature, but I liked this software. It's easy.

Also the main thing. It really shows sharp image quality. Color and contrast are fantastic.

THE STAND OUT FEATURES OF THIS MONITOR:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
As mentioned above, it is the only Free-sync monitor available under Rs 10,000.
In short, Free-sync technology allows the monitor's refresh rate to continuously adapt with respect to graphic card's frame rate. So, in a instance if your graphic card was generating 48 frames per second, your monitor will adapt to show 48 frames per second. All other monitors are fixed at 60 Hz or you can say that they are fixed to show 60 frames per second.

Now the question is why your monitor needs to adapt according to graphic card. Because it solves two problems which are,

1) tearing, when frames per second generated by your graphic card are more than 60Hz(or what monitor can output)

2) stuttering, which is generated to solve the problem of tearing by using Vertial sync technology (V-sync)

Watch some youtube videos to understand better about Free-sync. Without watching these videos, you will not understand tearing and stuttering. And without understand them, you will not understand the need of Free-sync.

Some basic things about Free-sync :

1) You will need a AMD graphic card for taking benefits of Free-sync. Because Free-sync is a AMD technology. NVidea has similar technology with name G-sync. But G-sync monitors are very costly in comparison to Free-sync monitors. And I am assured that they will not be available under Rs 10,000 for a long long time.

2) You unlock 75Hz refresh rate when you unable Free-sync.

THE PEOPLE IT WILL BENEFIT MOST :
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Gamers (even with Nvidea graphic card, as they also get 75Hz), Video editors and designers (as colors are important for them, which they cannot get on TN and VA panels) and any casual user(who simply uses computer for using mails and watch youtube videos) will benefit from this monitor.
Laptop owners who want a bigger 22 inch and higher 1080 resolution matte screen in comparison to their mostly smaller 14 inch and lower 768 resolution glossy screen.

BEST PLACE TO BUY FROM:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Buy it from amazon, because many old units come with VGA cable. And here you get new manufactured units with HDMI cable. I received such a new unit that it was manufactured on 25th April in China and I was using it on 4 th June. Approximately 1 month after it was made. Quality of HDMI cable is good.

PROS :
::::::::::

* 1) Free-sync
* 2) Anti glare IPS screen
* 3) 75 Hz refresh rate
* 4) Crisp image quality
* 4) Black stabilizers, for adjusting screen's gamma curve, which helps in seeing dark areas of games easily.
* 5) Awesome Onscreen Control Software
* 6) Best budget gaming monitor

CONS :
:::::::::::

* 1) Bezels are not as thin as many say.
* 2) Stand can only tilt, has no height adjustment or rotation. And also wobbles.
* 3) Only one HDMI.
* 4) Shows some IPS glow.
* 5) Glossy plastic back and stand.
* 6) Because of its popularity, it might not be available or sellers might increase their prices in future.
* 7) No speakers

ALTERNATIVES :
::::::::::::::::::::::::
If you are not interested in many of the features present in this monitor you can also opt for Dell S2216H, LG 22MP58VQ and HP 22ES. Which sometimes go down in price. But HP22ES has slow response time of 14ms (GTG).

CONCLUSION :
::::::::::::::::::::::
I didn't expected something like this will ever come under the price of 10,000. But it did. It's undoubtedly the best budget gaming monitor around the world.",5
"i just spent 9k for hd screen, BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE WORST PRODUCT!",1
"I am beginner graphic designer and I plan to work a lot on Adobe Photoshop, After Effects and Premiere Pro. So I bought this budget monitor. And instantly after testing it, I felt like sharing my experience with you. So, here it is.

Pros:

1. I have moved to 1080p monitor from my Dell 3542 laptop's 15 inch screen of resolution of 1366x768, so of course switching to a full hd 1080p IPS LED monitor was overwhelming. I really liked the huge space that I get in the timelines of After Effects/Premiere Pro and also the workspace of Photoshop and Illustrator.

2. Bezels are so thin that I feel like I am working on a very large screen monitor.

3. If you install the monitor software, no need to find the buttons physically on the monitor to adjust the display setting (monitor only has one buttom in thr bottom center). The software can be used to set everything like brightness, contrast, Picture-by-Picture (PBP), AMD FreeSync on/off etc, which in my opinion is better than traditional physical buttons.

4. Comes with a HDMI cable.

5. Build quality is a very good.

6. Monitor stand is easy to setup and feels like sturdy.

Cons:

Honestly, there are none. I purchased the item during the Prime Day with HDFC card 10% discount offer and I got for around 8500/- bucks. At that price point, I have nothing to complaint about. I loved this monitor so much that I would have purchased it for 9500/-, but luckily I had an HDFC card to avail the offer. Certainly, this is the best monitor you can buy under 10000/- in my opinion.

Note: Buying an UltraWide monitor like 25UM65-P is also a good option however the reason I went with 22mp68vq is below:

1. Don't know why but the user reviews of 25UM65-P on Amazon were not that good like 22mp68vq when I checked.

2. You would think that since 25UM65-P is a 25 inch Monitor, it would be larger than 22mp68vq, but that is not the case. 25UM65-P monitor actually is smaller is height due to its 21:9 aspect ration unlike the 16:9 of the 22mp68vq. Think of UltraWide 25UM65-P like the horizontally extended 20 inch monitor which means that the height of the 25UM65-P is equivalent to that of a 20 inch monitor. So you if you are planning to purchase UltraWide, better go with the larger display. Below is the reference website.

2. The 22mp68vq monitor is way cheaper than the 25UM65-P. The difference is so much that I thought I would purchase a Pen Tablet by saving the difference of amount I would have to pay for 25UM65-P. Besides, as mentioned in above point, I would have to go for larger screen which is even costlier.

Conclusion: As a beginner creative content creator, I am very happy with my decision to purchase this monitor. if I find any flaws in future, I would definitely update the same in this review.

Disclaimer: Above review based solely on my experience and presented as my point of view. I hope this review helps you making your purchase decision.

Go Creative, Go Crazy!",5
"love the clarity and quality, only thing the stand needs to be more sturdy since it wobbles on my table. I had to support the monitor against the side wall to make it stop shacking when I type.",5
"Not really 22 inches. Instead it is 21.5 inches in real screen display. LG should update specifications so as not to misguide buyers.

Amazon generally does great packing. But not this time. Per chance there was no damage.",3
"I bought this thing primarily for gaming, movies and occasional studies. Boy I was surprised at the picture quality I got. I was going in for a TN panel but decided to go for ips one for color accuracy sake. I am glad I got this one. The screen size is perfect for a desk PC. It has got really thin bezels which is good for multimonitor setups.
The best part of this is that it has got freesync and range is 40-70 Hz which is really good. SO now I can save about 25% of my GPU power and still get a smooth experience. coz playing at 45fps vs 60fps doesnt feel any different now. I use it with R3 2200g and i set all my games chill fps limit b/w 75 and 40 Hz.
It has also got 4 screen split mode (see linustechtips video). Never used it though. It also has preconfigured photo, cinema, game and reader mode which is awesome. just change the mode with a single button press. It comes a long HDMI cable about 4ft.
The colors and image quality are accurate and after using this for a month I am never going to use a 720p screen again. It comes with a wire manager hook that attaches to the back of the base.
Cons -
1) It has a forward tilt of 15 degree and a backward tilt of only 5 degree. Wish it would have given a back tilt of 15 degree also.
2) The height is non adjustable, but hey at this price what better you can get.
3) Installing is fairly simple but detaching it from the stand is a pretty daunting task, as you will need a screwdriver to unlock the latch on the stand.
Overall an awesome product.
There are cheaper monitors which have same specs but doesn't have HDMI (freesync works over HDMI and Display port Only) or freesync in the same price range. But I would say investing a bit more in a good freesync monitor would go a long way, as how much often do we upgrade our monitors, maybe at the very least 5 yr or so, but games get demanding every year. So if you maybe playing at 60fps now but in 2 yr you will not be able to sustain 40fps in new games, thats where freesync kicks in.",4
"Awesome Amazing... Premium product.. I'm a Samsung guy but I bought it by the looks of it and it turned out to be as good as it looks.. worth the buy..
Sold By: NTPLtd",5
"Good quality monitor with clear colour, good brightness and colour reproduction. Ports at the back adequate for home office use. Doesn't come with height adjust but screen can be tilted. Easy set up with fuss free operation.

This arrived today, so expect to update this review after I use it for a while. That said, it seems like a good buy!",5
"Excellent gaming monitor under 10000rs.very good quality. Ordered two, one for my brother and myself. 75hz refresh rate by enabling Freesync. Just go for it eyes closed.",5
"Monitor colours changed automatically, not showing natural colours",1
"This monitor is very good and is having a very good viewing angle. The black's are very good while gaming but will have to play around with it a bit. This monitor comes with a 1-HDMI, 1-DVI-D, 1-headphone out, 1-D-Sub and 1-DC in. Dont go by the pix it doesn't support 2 HDMI it has only on because ot its model if you want 2 HDMI port's then go for a model higher.
You will get a D-Sub cable and power adaptor with this model but will get HDMI cable with a model higher then this. For manue you will get a joystick which is at bottom under the LG logo and i love using and playing with it :P.
Love the anty glare screen on it because we (me and my friends) were watching a movie and i was in an angle with the monitor and window. Still there was no problem watching that movie only problem was that movie wasn't that good :(. Now you can get an idea of the viewing angel and anty glare screen of this monitor.",5
"Was in need of a display that can be used as computer monitor and to watch tv. LG had more models but finally decided not to go for monitor/tv models bcoz of slower response time (14 ms). Needed full HD and HDMI and didn't want the display too big bcoz I will be sitting close to it. zeroed on this one, bought it from brick&mortar store for rs 9500.

As very detailed reviews has been written i am not going to repeat whats already written. the monitor does wobble as many has written, but only if you touch the monitor and not the table. Even though the monitor wobbles, it's a slight movement and is not going to topple. The base is heavy enough to keep the monitor firm and doesn't wobble with along the monitor, only the screen wobbles.

The picture clarity is very good, I tried playing some Bluray on it and it looks astonishing. The videos have been panned and zoomed to fill the screen and you can find a nomal one too with black bars on top and bottom. I know these images are not enough to show how it look on the monitor, but just to have visual. those white streaks, your eyes cant see it, only camera picks it up.

Will add more later",4
"I'm going to shoot straight.
The backlighting bleeds on this panel from the edges, especially noticeable in dark scenes. This isn't just limited to this panel though and I'd wager that most IPS panels without multi-zone backlighting suffer from this. So if you're looking for better black levels, don't buy this because a similarly priced TN or even a VA panel would be better.

Things that I liked:
Vesa mount support, awesome if you own aonotor stand.
Colour accuracy is awesome and would probably surpass other panels in its price range.
Despite the lacking blacks, the whites do shine on this panel and the contrast is good as well.
Wide array of picture adjustments and the included joystick is such a pleasure to use.

Things that I thought were meh:

There is no monitor height adjustment. An absolute miss imo from LG's end.
As mentioned earlier, there is edge backlight bleed visible in dark scenes.
Very restrictive connectivity options with no option for Display port or USB.
No quick screen turn-off toggle.
75hz refresh rate is only achievable on an AMD GPU.
Glossy plastic accents are very ugly and get dirty immediately after taking the peel off.

Overall 3.5/5.",4
"Please read my review entirely before coming to a decision.

I made a huge mistake of getting a 60hz monitor. I have a legion Y740 and it has 144hz screen and omg you can see the difference clearly between two!
It had so many stutters, lag and god knows what? (Please don't buy a lower Hertz monitor if your have a higher Hertz laptop or another monitor, trust me your eyes will hurt seeing the difference)
And, out of luck it was not returnable :) so I was stuck with it.
Luckily there was an option to boost it to 75hz with nvidia G-Sync.
Ohh yeah, it's not written there but it does support G-sync along with AMD's free-sync!
So, enabling Nvidia G-sync and boosting the monitor to 75hz made it a little better, and stutter and lag was gone (not entirely! But it was better).
Definitely not for gaming. I needed this monitor for work so It didn't bother me much!
I will never think of gaming in this one :p
It does have a good picture quality and good support for multi tasking!
So it's amazing for work or casual use like watching a movie! But, definitely not for gaming!
Hope my review helps!",4
"Why headphone not functioning
What should be the defects",2
good product,4
"I wanted all-rounder monitor for my needs
You must be wondering all-rounder in terms of what? wait let me tell you.
This monitor has HDMI, DVI and VGA along the side you get headphone out jack so you can hook your headphone or speaker systems to it for audio which is great.
I am using this Monitor as my TV and Monitor both
As you can see in the images I have connected my firetv stick on HDMI and Computer on DVI and when I use firetv stick I just need to connect my speakers for audio.
Note: The same way you can use your TV setup box also like Tata sky, Dish TV and Videocon D2h Etc.

So now coming to monitor I have been using this since last 3-4 months and I would say it is best bang for buck. Though I am not going into too much technical aspects here but it has Anti-glare IPS panel with almost bezel less design view angles are also best. The display is pre color calibrated (LG claims) and I guess it is true blacks are black and whites are white. You would love to watch movies and play games on it as I do :D

For those who claims it has no speakers. Bhai!! Headphone out jack is there you can use it to hook up your sound system.

If you want further information you can write comment down below I will try to answer you if possible.

Final words
Best in class go for it without any hassle and for gamers definitely the best monitor you could get for price.",5
"I bought this monitor in 2019 with 3 yrs warranty. I accidentally damaged the monitor and it looks like the internal display crack. I have been calling the service center since almost a week but they are not registering my complaint even after calling them for 20-22 times. Plus they told me I have to pay the service charges and for the parts too. I don't mind paying for the replacement parts but if I have to pay service charges also then what is the meaning of warranty?! Even after agreeing to pay all the charges, they are not registering my complaint!! Wtf!! None is interested what happens after you buy the product... No complaint no visit... Warranty is useless as much as the LG itself... Don't waste your hard earned money!!!",1
"Video watching is very impressive and it wont disappoint movie lovers. It can be also useful to beginner level editors. Setting up the black stabilizer well can help the editors. It has very good view angle at the same time. It provides flawless gaming experience as a monitor made for gamers.
The biggest feature of the monitor is undoubtedly the addition of freesynce within its budget compared to g-sync. Its HDMi frequency is 40-75 Hz. According to the most reviewers 40-75 Hz is the sweet spot for freesync. You can unlock the 75 hz refresh rate by turning on freesync from the menu. It has a set back though, when the freesync is enabled you wont be able to see the bios, however you can turn off the freesync when you need to access bios menu. Where freesync can almost make the frame rate change unnoticeable. We tried gta v which is running at 60 Hz with our nvidia card. Color looks vibrant and there was no response time issues. We changed the response time to low from the settings to get the most out of it.We spent a good deal of time in gaming and i have to say gaming this good at this price is insane.

Finally it performed exceptionally well compared to its budget. We will recommend LG22MP68VQ-P monitor for gamers, photo and video editors, web developers and professionals specially for those who are looking for a good monitor and tight on budget.
Pros
Stylish slim-bezel design
Great image quality
Better than average for gaming
Has a VESA mount
Great value
Cons
Wobbly, non-height-adjustable stand
Less than 90% sRGB coverage",5
Nice,5
"GO FOR IT!

I finally bought this LG 22MP68VQ-P. I surveyed my city so much for it. Firstly it was out of stock in here. But after so much tries one vendor got ready to book it for me. The monitor is second to none in its category. It has least bezels around and it looks very premium. It is really very big in size. Value a lot for money. I am a designer and I felt it the best for me. It only shakes on shaky platform.

If you want to buy Dell, HP or any other so first see the comparisons on youtube. In my own opinion Dell, HP are just professional makers, they do not give beautiful thinks that Samsung, LG give. I also took interest in BenQ, I felt it more better, but its not so familiar company, also has less service centers around. That is it.

Specifications are same as I saw like you did in websites. But beauty I got was really very very amazing and overwhelming.

Thank you for reading my review. Its fair and clear.",5
"I did not buy this product from Amazon. However I felt that a review might help other potential buyers make a decision.
I have been late jumping into the LCD monitor wagon.
After reviewing various options, it was clear that 22""/ 21.5"" was the sweet-spot for price to screen size.
For normal desktop use, this monitor is more than adequate, a little on the luxury side.

When the correct graphics drivers are installed, the maximum supported resolution is 1920 x 1080. It leaves a 0.5mm border on all 4 sides. It did make me think if it was normal, but on second thought, I felt that it was necessary to get an exact, non distorted image. So this avoids all kinds of manual settings.

It has D-Sub, DVI-D and HDMI connectivity, although only D-Sub cable is provided. The audio is carried through the connecting cable and is available on a 3.5mm stereo jack on the back of the monitor. The monitor does NOT come with any built-in speakers.

It comes with preset viewing options such as custom, cinema, reading, photo etc. that can be set by a jog control below the screen panel in the center. It also comes with a software CD that allows the monitor to be controlled from the desktop. Be aware that the software does not support XP and that is not good.

Over all, I love this monitor and would recommend it for anyone willing to spend a couple of thousand more than the very basic types.

Thanks!

"Good Monitor for 1080p gaming under 10k. I am using this with my MacBook Pro 2016. Unfortunately this is recognised as a TV via HDMI so the display doesn't look as good as it should, especially when it comes to colour profiles. I'd look for a display with Displayport if you want to use it with a Mac. This way its recognised as an external display and not a TV. I've had this issue with 2012 rMBP too when connected to a Dell 23 inch display with HDMI. But this one is definitely better than that. One other issue is that the display wobbles. Yes its got some wobble to it which can get annoying sometimes. For gaming it'll get 5 stars. For work 3 starts. So overall 4 starts.

Note : Purchased from local seller that offered better price than Amazon surprisingly.

Update : This monitor may not support HDCP necessary for Netflix. Netflix in edge or windows 10 app will not play above 720p. I have an 8th Gen PC and connected via HDMI cable so technically there should be no problem for Netflix content, however I believe there seems to be HDCP incompatibility issues. I have tried all troubleshooting but this will not play 1080p Netflix. Even connecting a streaming stick which should technically work 100% without any problem. Still no luck. Updated review accordingly.",2

Defective product,2
Bought this product on amazon with another account during sale at ‚Çπ.7000 and It arrived after 5 days. I bought this monitor primarily for reading PDFs. The display is yellow on right part of the screen and it is unbearable. It is even worst on lower brightness. The yellowish part was clearly visible during browsing and when viewing PDFs files. Ordered a replacement. Lets see how it goes. Attached photos for proof.,1
"The display is no where of a good FHD monitor. I'm using this with MacBook Air. The fonts look blurry/hazy. There's a huge difference in display quality when compared to other monitors that I connect to. Let down, and can't even return.

"Good monitor for office use...

For gaming I would suggest a bigger monitor of atleast 32 inches.

"Okay so it's been almost a week since I got this monitor. Initially got it when my got a ps4 and just needed a high quality monitor to play in my room. Found this one to be the cheapest under that category. Delivery was quick, got it within 2 days.
The monitor just looks amazing, the thin bezels just complements its look when u have a full hd video playing. The only downside is that it has no speakers, granted so doesn't any other monitor, so I'm stuck using headphones via my ds4 all the time. In all it's amazing, go for it! 5 stars!",5
"No HDMI CABLE ???
WHY",1
An absolute pleasure to the eyes for people who spend more than an hour on Laptops or Desktops. Helps to maintain viewing posture (Neck) Superb Color Depth helps in working on Graphic Design Software and of course try it out for Racing Games it makes games absolutely irresistible. I tried it even with my TATA SKY HD Set top box and it was WOW.,5
"Bought this 2 Years Back on Amazon, it was 8999 back then.
Awesome all rounder..
Perfect for gaming..
Display panel is bright enough and the thin bezels over the corners looks classy with the LG branding..
It has 1 HDMI port..
But I use PC & DTH on this by removing and connecting the HDMI Cable..
Even DTH works flawlessly..
Picture Quality is 5x times better than 32 inch MI TV as this is 24 inch with 1080p resolution I love watching HD contents with DTH in this Monitor..

Worth for money.. go for it",5

I chose this one over Samsung night vision monitor because this one had an audio out port plus it was 250 nits while Samsung was 200 nits. It was a tough choice though, as I liked the idea of a built in table lamp to illuminate the keyboard area. 1 less star for the shaky, non-height-adjustable stand.",4
"The monitor meets my requirement but below the cons to look for:
1) The monitor height not adjustable
2) Also the monitor cannot be tilted
3) Has HDMI port but no HDMI cable

Pros:
Good display
Split screen option really helpful",4
I just order this today 2-oct-2019 so I hope when I receive the product it's ok and fulfill my requirements it's my first LG Monitor so when I receive the product then I update the review for now i give 5 star for the price 6999,5

"Amazing monitor with truly ips panel and great view angle.
The monitor comes with company color calibration which is good thing.

Excellent FHD display. Bought locally but totally worth the price. Only thing is it is 60hz. But thats for gamers only and at this price you shouldn't complain. Anti glare works fantastic. Must buy.,5
I don't like it. Because the display problem starts in 5 months. when I call the service center he comes after two months. He charges RS.475 for just a visit. but not any working.don't buy it,1
Good for video editing...i bought this for video editing it has a 99 percent rgb which gives you a brilliant colour,5

Bought from a TV shop in 8800 INR,4
"Well I may not be the right person to review any monitor however I can say that price of the product remains high most of time. Just because it has got the Free-Sync and support for VESA it does not necessarily have to be costly. The LCD panel looks similar to Dell s2216h and in no way it differ from it. The same Panel with 3H coating on it offering a year warranty on it.. Whereas in Dell they provide you with 3 years of warranty as well speakers beneath the monitor.
Not just I am complaining about it. I definitely do not recommend something this is priced higher than its specs. Take my words, and see by yourself. I have made several purchases from amazon including the Dell s2216h but I truly understand the concept behind the panel type, and back lit now.",3
Very good for budget,5
I wanted a television and not a monitor,1
"Alright so i finally got this monitor after a day of delay in delivery.

Will directly jump to what i feel about this monitor after using it for 3 hours.

Great colour. Black levels arn't as high as i expected it to be but is pretty good, colour expression covers it up. 1x HDMI port, 1x DVI (Probably DVI-D, not sure) and 1x VGA.

Am currently using VGA cable and have an HDMI cable ordered.

This monitor has some IPS glow which i have in the left bottom and left top side. Not that bad and is actually pretty common.

I though noticed some very faint horizontal lines during the display of black coloured content. Could be a VGA cable problem but if it is not solved with the HDMI cable. I'll probably ask for a replacement. Not that its unbearable but still, the angle this monitor is for my display, those lines are still noticable.

It has only one button to control monitor functions like contrast, brightness. Its like a joystick control. I like it.

My old monitor is a cheap LCD acer one so i like this, only if IPS glow was a bit less and the black lines werent there, it would have got 5 stars.

I dont care about shaking since i dont plan to keep it on a shaking surface. Though if you place this in a windy room or room with good ventilation, monitor may shake a bit that that is okay in my opinion, not that noticable.

Good one.

----Update----
So i decided to replace the monitor. The Horizontal line issue wasnt fixed and i also started getting corrupt screen upon resolution changes on both HDMI as well as VGA usage. Waiting for the replacement to come and see if it is the issue with my monitor or with the whole model range.

----Update #2----
Sorry forgot about my review XD.

So i got the replacement, went through some trouble but in short, got it.
So the horizontal line issue is still there. It definitly is the problem of this model range. The lines are not noticable in other colours except grey. You can kind of see them if you have been using computers for a long time or are a geek.

Also buy a good HDMI cable, i would recommend a bluerigger HDMI cable on amazon, that cable works great. Do not use VGA or analog DVI with this monitor as it can cause corrupt screen issues which is definitly not desirable. I mean if you are buying a monitor priced at around 10k, why not add 500 INR more and get a decent HDMI cable through which you can connect it to your PC.

This monitor is capable of 75 Hz @ 1080p, its not mentioned here so i will let you all know.

AMD freesync is an Addon you get here along with flickr free though it doesnt matter much unless you are gaming on it.

Colour reproduction is very good, and black levels great though ips glow ruins it when you are in a dark room.
Anti glare coating works great,
The light bulb behind me does not bother me much now. Although anti-glare coating comes at its own disadvantage though not a big one. When the screen is white, you actually can see the affect of the coating, though not much. Its hard to explain what it looks like but well, it isnt that much of a bother. Dont decide not to buy this monitor only because of this anti-glare thing on white display, trust me, its not at all an issue. I just mentioned it to let you all know of my experiences.

Also, when you get the monitor, go to monitor menu > picture > picture adjust. There, set the black stablizer to 0 if you are watching movies and all. Also if your movie does not have many black scenes, especially movies like batman, in the same place, set black level option to low. What this helps is that, it improves the colour on the cost of dark scenes being more dark. I tinker with this setting a lot.

Thats all i have experience with this monitor. I bought this monitor mainly for watching movies, animes, basically watching videos and for adobe products. I have a TN panel monitor which is currently set up in a dual monitor setup along with this monitor with the help of my Graphic Card AMD R9 380. I do gaming on my TN monitor and all kind of other work on this monitor.

Pretty happy with the product, if you are tight on budget, definitly go with this monitor.",4
On screen control software is not working. otherwise the monitor is good enough,4
Awesome Monitor,5
"The monitor has an IPS screen with full HD resolution. It has DVI, D-Sub and HDMI connectivity. The colours are vibrant and the anti-glare finish is quite pleasing to the eye. I am using it primarily for gaming (COD, Farcry) and haven't had any issues with response time, lag etc (although I am not a competitive gamer). However I did notice some odd behaviour while installing windows 10. The monitor was connected through HDMI and the initial resolution during setup was 1024x768. The colours were psychedelic and the monitor even froze a couple of times during initial setup and initial use. This happened when I connected using a GTX 1060 card as well as during connecting with HDMI on the motherboard. After installing the LG drivers and tweaking, I realized that this happens whenever the resolution is not the native 1080p.

To sum up, when it works it does perfectly. However dont get pertrubed in case you face hitches during initial installation when windows defaults to 1024x768,",4
I love it. Great monitor in this price range.,5
"Awesome packaging and super fast delivery by Delhivery. The product is amazing as I expected this to be, glossy borderless monitor, the best you can get in this budget for gaming",5

"LG keep compromising with the qualities of the product. or Amazon sold the defective product to me...when I first turned on the monitor there was a blinking line at the bottom of the display. but after I adjust the display, that line won't be seen. I should have replaced the product when i saw this blinking line. But i took chance as i couldn't see while working. But now its costing me right now....Its not been one month of use, now i see 3 vertical lines.

Amazon definitely selling defective products when there is a huge sale. I will never buy any product from amazon. Disappointed",1

"I build my PC along with this monitor, so this monitor supports AMD free sync technology which most users would find a glitch as I too use Nvidia GPU anyhow I still tested that on and find the picture quality turned out to be cinematic and just glorious, wish I had a AMD card lying. Though it's fast, it has HDMI its on screen control gives you custom veiwing tastes so it wouldn't be a problem.
This is a must buy monitor if you are on a tight budget.
*LG didn't sponsored me so yeah...*",4
"The display is great BUT THE BEZELS ARE NOT AS THIN AS SHOWN IN THE IMAGE !!! They made the physical bezels thin but inside the screen there is a thin black border going all around the screen reducing the effective display area to 21.5"" ! THIS ISN'T EVEN 22"" but 21.5"" display monitor ! FALSE MARKETING BY LG !",1
lcd or led,1
"I do not like this Monitor.
Yes, its sleek and sexy and looks just amazing - Agreed.
The story ends here.
I'll just list out the Cons I noticed
1. The monitor shakes a lot because the stand cannot take the weight.
2. The color gamut of this monitor is only 72% whereas the Dell S2216H is more than 80% and trust me, it make a lot of difference.
3. The pictures show 2 HDMI ports on the rear whereas the one I received has only 1
4. It only has a Headphone Out port. The Dell has both Out and In. so if you think you can connect an HDMI from your Laptop to this monitor and a Headphone from the monitor. It wont work.
5. The brightness on the highest setting 100% brightness and 100% contrast is not bright enough. The colors look washed out and unimpressive. I compared this with the Dell S2216H and I can see the difference. No match to the Dell.
6. Called Amazon for a return and was denied. Well thats my fault because I did not check their return/refund policy before hand.

All in all, a thorough let down.",2
"I bought this beauty from a store nearby for 9200rs just two days back and i must say its beautiful!!! Since I'm a gamer and my next rig is gonna be AMD based(Ryzen & vega),having freesync is a big deal for me.I consider myself a hardcore gamer and i also do photo and video editing and this monitor suits my needs perfectly.As you all know having LED IPS pannel is a must having for editors.The 75hz refresh rate is also another plus.Don't worry about input lag because belive me i notice no input lag at all. Always go with freesync as both it and gsync are the same thing except gsync monitors are very over priced.So if you are a gamer,you will get free sync and lighting fast response times & a high refresh rate.Also if you are a professional photo editor,the led ips pannel with deep blacks and super sharp image quality will surely help in making some jaw dropping images and video. In online games like battlefield 1,speed and responsiveness is what you need.So stop wasting time time and buy this beast as it's the only one with all these features(especially free sync) even under the 15k range.Plus no need to say about watching movies on this thing,it's just insane :D

I like it,5
I brought this monitor from a local store and honestly I was not impressed by the picture quality.I was previously a dell monitor user and I find the quality of Dell display far better than this one.Only downside with dell monitor is that the screen is a little bit reflective but when you are gaming in your room who cares.,2

"I have three HD and 4K monitors from DELL and one from AOC, highly satisfied with them. This LG one was a cheapest one for office desktop.There is definitely something with this Monitor, probably the cost cutting made it like this. Here are some difficulties i am facing
1. Stand: This curved design is a problem for me, it neither gives good stability(its always dangling on my table) and it occupy the same space as a conventional design does.
2. HDMI port and DVI port etc etc: So if you put multiple inputs which i suppose it was intended to do, this monitor gets confused and you can get any error of Universe on it. so one input at a time.
3. last and most important thing : The Letters, texts, scripts have some ghost image making reading difficult. initially i thought its my settings, so i tried multiple Windows attempts for text settings and it didn't work. i checked my graphic card , changed the CPU and it didn't work. there is some problem with colours also which i am unable to explain in words but my eyes can sense it.
So Not my cup of tea.
Hope this help.",4

"I'm a full time Developer and I needed a bigger screen because staring at small texts all day long on a 15inch screen is not good enough and it strains my eyes.
Earlier i was considering 24inch of the same model but the price difference was of 4k INR and i did not find it worth but still i had doubts in my mind that whether i made a mistake or what. But once i got this product and i set it up, I'm telling you guyz, it is just awesome and for programmers I don't think that 4k is worth. That 2 inch difference is not something that you could notice. Infact, after using this 22 inch monitor, i think 1080 is the best resolution, and going 24 or 27 is overkill and you could see the pixels in the screen. So, if you are buying a FHD monitor, 22 inch is the best size you should go for, 24 and 27 inch is best for 1440 resolution.
Not only for programmers, if you a media consumer then this is a great choice at this price.
You should go for this product.",5
"Pixelated text and fonts cause headache while working or browsing. The system settings and menu is also pixelated, so it's not the issue with specific operating system. I tried connecting with windows, linux and Mac but pixelated overall appearance in all. HD videos appear good, without issues but I mostly work with text while coding and browsing, so it's waste of money for me. I trusted LG after reading lot of good reviews but no-one pointed this pixelation and blurry text/fonts issue. I hope my review helps others to make informed choice",2

I don't know why this is happening, maybe my monitor has some issues, if anyone is facing the same issue, please reply or otherwise I have to replace this one.",2
"The overall picture quality is quite good. Look and feel of the monitor is also good. It has a good level of brightness and contrast range. I use it for my job and spend more than 10 hours per day using it. But I don't feel any strain on my eyes. The height of the stand is perfect for me.

However, there are two issues:
1. There is some light bleeding (see photo)
2. Speaker quality is very bad
Although I didn't expect the speakers to be of great quality, it still disappointed me for how bad they sound.

But it has an audio port, so it should be ok. I haven't tried the audio port sound though.

If you are ok with these two issues, you can go ahead with this one.",4
As LG is the main player in the field of displays and this time too I was not disappointed. It is a good monitor for both developers and gamers. We have an option for fine-tuning the settings for the monitor and there is also an out for speakers.,5
"Its a good monitor which uses IPS panel, so colors are accurate and viewing angle is good. Refresh rate is 75hz, but its 60hz out of the box, you would need to set it up to work at 75hz. I mainly use it as a second screen with my laptop for web development, but have tested games like Call of duty Warzone and CSGO. Sadly, none of them reach 60hz on my laptop. Upgrade from 60hz to 75hz does not feel significant otherwise in day to day computing. If gaming is the only purpose and you have GPU that can push games to 100 FPS or more, then 75hz display will be a bottleneck. Look for 144hz.",5
Backlight bleeding issue worst display,1
Ordered 1st one that have a horrible backlight bleeding and there is a gap between the panel and frame at the bottom right corner got replacement with another one and this have a opening at the top the panel is not glued properly light is leaking from the gaps at the top and this too have a backlight bleeding at top and bottom which is easily noticeable when screen gets dark,1
COLOUR ARE TOO GOOD TO LOOK ON THIS MONITOR WITHOUT ANY BACKLIGHT BLEEDING.,5
"I had done quite a research before I bought this monitor and if you believe me this is the best monitor in this price range...
Cost varies from 11K to 11.5K, features and design are obviously mentioned in the product description and each of them stands true.

The speakers are good. I checked and there is no backlight bleed in my monitor...

The look kills it and it's worth every penny you buy it for...",4
"Colors are very accurate!
I can also adjust the sharpness which will make things even sharper and clear.

:::VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:::
To get the best Picture experience you have to change some of the settings. As the factory settings are verybad

-Keep the contrast to 50 and brightness to 80 or 90
-Keep the BLACK level to LOW OR OFF this will give you a washed out effect if you keep it High don't use it.
-Set the Picture Quality to Warm

Check the 2nd pic for more info try to keep it same as mine.",5
I hereby want to declare for the welfare of my fellow amazon customers that this product that I am writing review of comes with free dead pixels and bright pixels however the quantity of each is determined on how lucky you are till now I have replaced one monitor first one had SIX DEAD PIXELS and now to my amazement second one has 4 DEAD PIXELS and 1 BRIGHT PIXEL and 2 STUCK PIXELS so if you are bored in quarantine and have spare time to replace this product repeatedly then please buy.,1
"My monitor has fog like stains(the monitor is just 3+ month old it had it from start but it was not that visible at the start), and the panel is to be replaced, today is 21st day after I complained to LG service the technician came 2 times 1st time he documented took pictures of the problem and made the request for the panel after 10 days when I called customer service again they gave me 2 phone numbers to call both of them did not pick up even after calling 5+ times, after calling to customer service they sent the same technician to open and take pictures of the panel and now when I called them yesterday(20th day) they said your request is cancelled then they said it's open they said some senior will call me yes they called and said they will coordinate with me and the technician, now its been 24 hours the same thing happened and they are playing possum again, I complained to head of customer service in India or something and registered my grievance online, my lg tv which was not in warranty was repaired just in 2 days paid 5k the monitor is in warranty, this is how LG works carelessness everywhere they wont extend the warantee so u have to just shut up and bear with them even if its your loss",1
"Using this for office work. It's a great monitor for my purpose.
Only problem I see is its ""Made in China"". If I had realised this, I would have opted for something else",5
"(EDIT: As many reviewers have noted, there's a dead pixel issue appearing now after 2 months of use. Disappointed as return is no longer possible!)

First monitor I've purchased. Extremely happy with it, using it as a secondary display for ease of WFH.
Easy to install but feels a bit flimsy on the thin stand. Liked that there are 2 HDMI ports, for multi-purpose use (laptop + Chromecast). The matte screen + multiple screen viewing mode options make it easy on the eyes. Thin bezel is a bonus, picture quality is top notch.",1
"I bough this in June for my WFH and using it since then. I am a software developer and use this with my Macbook Pro, Dell Vostro 3568 and Dell Precision 7540 and even my RaspberryPi.
PICTURE QUALITY 3.5/5
Picture quality is quite good for watching videos which are crystal clear. It is also quite good with editors in dark theme mode. Great while using VSCode and IntelliJ IDEA in dark mode. But not good at all with text in white background like in browsers. In white background, text is pixelated and you can see pixel dots which can cause headache. Had to change resolution to 1920x1080 manually in Dell 3568 as it defaults to 1366x768 which gave better picture. Other devices were by default in FullHD so no problem. Those who calling it OLED likeis only when you watch videos.
COLOR 4/5
Color is very good. I didn't have any backlight bleeding. Still I felt black could have been better considering its price. Black is better than Dell 3568 but not so good like Mac or Precision 7540.
BRIGHTNESS 5/5
Extremely bright. I had to reduce it to just 20.
ANTI-GLARE 5/5
Matt finish is awesome. No reflection and pain in eyes.
DESIGN 2/5
3 side bezel less design gives an amazing look. Knew it can't be tilted vertically, but this one can hardly be titlted horizontally.",4
"Got the monitor for approx. 6000 during the sale. Replaced once (Details afterwards). Amazon sent me a used monitor, really disappointed at it. Even the invoice of the other person was there in the box.
I ordered the 22 inch model because honestly there is no use of having a 24 inch monitor in Full HD resolution, it needs more resolution to get better ppi. The display quality of the monitor is excellent at the price range (even through VGA port). Color reproduction is very good & viewing angles are great too.
3-side (top, left & right) bezels are quite thin & the bottom bezel is also of negligible thickness with LG branding. Overall thickness of the monitor is also quite less & aesthetically looks good with the curved stand.
Navigating the monitor menu is easy with the joystick button provided at the bottom of the monitor.

Now coming to the only flaw this monitor has, which basically is a flaw with the IPS technology. The monitor i received first had some yellow tint on the lower left corner of the screen (& quite negligible on the upper left & right corners) when viewing straight & increased/decreased on changing viewing angles & was only noticeably visible in dark backgrounds or playing games with dark scenes in a dim lit room. After research on the internet i found out that it was 'IPS Glow'. Do not confuse 'IPS Glow' with 'Backlight Bleeding', these are 2 different things. Backlight bleed doesn't change when viewing at an angle.
After discussing with Amazon i replaced my monitor in hope of getting a piece with less of the IPS glow, but unfortunately faced the same with the new monitor too.
This is the case with all IPS monitors, even high end ones. Low manufacturing quality i would say by all the companies. It's just a gamble that you will get a monitor with less or negligible IPS Glow. You can do things to lessen the effect of IPS glow virtually like, having ambient light around the monitor, low brightness, tilting the monitor as per your seating height or just use the monitor in well lit environment if you can. Moreover, IPS monitors are usually considered best for Multimedia purposes like photo/video editing, for which this monitor is a perfect fit.
I use the monitor with my PS4 also & i would say the games look great But if you are a hardcore gamer, go for TN panel monitors. If you are looking for a mid-ground mixture of IPS & TN panel, then go for VA panel monitors.
Overall, the monitor is perfect for average users with regular PC work, Multimedia usage, casual gaming (both PC-75hz & PS4-60hz) etc.",5
"If you want a 24 inch IPS display (measure screen diagonally ie. BottomLeft corner to TopRight corner) for entertainment like watching movies and serials etc, graphic work like Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator etc and also want to play FPS games (4ms ResponseTime, 1ms MBR, 75hz) like CSGO and PUBG and have a Rs10,000 budget then this is the screen for you.

The delivery came in a double carton packaging...when you open a gift box and there is another smaller box inside the gift box..ya this amazon delivery packaging was something like that...the inside box was the original LG carton...i received a factory sealed brand new LG 24"" monitor.. assembled monitor stand, attached power and hdmi cables and changed Monitor Settings Screen Refresh Rate to 75hz (RightClickMouse> ScreenResolution> Advanced settings> Monitor> MonitorSettings ..change.. ScreenRefreshRate to 75Hertz) ..That's it and you are done. (If you using Nvidia then one more setting should be done: Open Nvidia ControlPanel..then under Manage3D Settings, Background Application Max Frame Rate, sellect ON and keep at 75 FPS...this will help screen tearing and playing games will be smooth..also suggest to keep V-Sync ON)

If I am asked whether there is anything that I didn't like about the monitor I'll say everything about it is just great and thanks to LG..However if I'm told to find 3 faults on this particular LG monitor and that my life depends on it; then and only then I'd point out these three CONS:
1. Even though Stand is wide, grippy and looks to be made of very high quality material and holds screen firmly anchored on the table...the screen is kinda wobbly on a RicketyTable..(like a bobblehead toy-figure on a cars dashboard: the figurine does not move or fall but the head is constantly wobbling) but do not fear my lads the built quality of this LG monitor is made of good quality material and look is SOLID.
2. The sound is different..volume is loud and clear but something about it is wierdly different..no equalisers in settings only some MaxxAudio but enabling it made audio kinda hollow sounding so may have to twerk PC software equaliser settings.
3. The HDMI cable plugs horizontally at the back so it protrudes defeating the very purpose of slim design and I wonder how someone can wall mount this screen.

[Note: If you want to buy screen primarily for gaming CSGO, PUBG etc then suggest you to read difference between TN and IPS panel; TN panels have a better response time while IPS panels have better viewing angles and color reproduction.. my brother went for a 24"" ASUS brand TN panel monitor and it's ResponseTime is 0.5ms having 165hz and the difference in advantage is huge nearly cheating types but the problem is the screen is very dull looking so not much fun while doing graphic work and watching movies etc]",4
Wrost products got damage piece and when I call to the customer service they made my replacement request but no one come it's 9 day from the date of odering what a normal person can do for this . This is insane I don't expect this type of service from amazon whenever I call them they say tomorrow the person will come between 7 to 7 I ask for the no. They say he will contact you .no specific time on the return window what can one do they say same thing everytime I call them . Pls amazon it's an humble request help us.,1
I have not used it so far but I am giving rating just because it's not 24 inch. It is 21 inch monitor to which company is claiming of 24 inch.,1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 After using it for nearly 15 days here is my review.
1. Must say that product is a great value for money product. Serves my purpose of using it as a TV. I have been using Chromecast extensively from the day one.
2. It has 2 HDMI ports and a VGA port which is greatly helpful in connecting multiple devices like computer, CCTV monitoring system, Chromecast and even set top box also.
3. I personally have a F&D soundbar which I use for this purpose. 3.5 mm audio port works perfectly.
4. I am not a gamer and and I use this monitor in entertainment purpose only and I'm more than happy with the picture quality.
5. the packaging could have been better by the seller but the delivery was great.",5
"Bought it to use both as a work monitor and also for entertainment, the color production is excellent, no led bleeding and it has two 5 watt speakers which are good enough to meet your requirement without creating wire clutter for a set of speakers! Comes with Vesa mount and two hdmi ports, which are again very useful features.",5
"display quality is good and everything is as u expect it to be but the built quality of the frame and the body is not that good
and the display panel wobbles a lot.
I was using a dell fhd tn monitor before this and in comparison the so called ""IPS"" display, colors and the viewing angles are only slightly better.
i guess it was my fault for expecting too much because this is my first ips diplay but still. and again as i said the build quality is not what i was expecting from a big brand like LG.
The display also has backlight bleeding which is normal for ips monitors to be honest.
i got this display for 9000 and in my opinion this display is not worth more than 7000-7500.",4
"Good monitor. Display quality is the best part. Stance is gorgeous. Two HDMI ports is a nice feature as I can switch between two laptops whenever I want without the need to unplug hdmi cable from one and connecting to other. (Note: it comes with only one HDMI cable as expected).
Presets of picture modes helpful though there isn't an option to customize over them like on a tv set. For example reader mode is good but feels quite bright and, there is no way I can adjust it. Overall excellent purchase. LG scores very high on displays; be it TV or monitors. Met my expectations. It is a great addition to ease my work from home.",4
Dead pixel on a new monitor is the worst experience,1
"Since all the reviews are clubbed here for the various variants of this monitor, this review is for 22MK600M (Black). This model is one of the most recent models. The screen is good. Has AMD sync (works only with AMD processors not intel). Comes with an HDMI Cable, Power Cord & Table Stand.

Note: This variant DOES NOT have the inbuilt LG screen-split software. One can use freeware software of the Windows 10 inbuilt split screen feature should suffice.

The build is pretty decent given the price point (personally it felt little weak on the non bezel less ends, but nothing to worry). Screen tilt by certain degrees is possible.

Over recommend this monitor given the price point, value for money

There are 2 USB ports, VGA port and audio out. It DOES NOT have inbuilt speakers.",4
"Don't buy this monitor and make a mistake like me. Go for the benq instead.

Cons:-
1) The text is pixelated even if you are at 2 feet away from monitor.
2) Brightness is too high even at 30%. At 0% there is minimal dimming, behaves like 40% brightness of benq monitor. This strains the eyes if you game for prolonged sessions or work in night shifts.
3) 75Hz refresh rate is not noticeable like 120 or 144Hz.
4) Very high IPS glow.

Pros:-
1) The color reproduction in this panel is very good compared to my VA gaming monitor.
2) No back light bleeding (but the ips glow is always there and it's too high)",1
"This monitor is the best under 10K segment. Picture Quality is superb. On screen control is very useful, you can tweak whatever you want. Color quality and Viewing angles are immersive. Without even a single doubt you can go for it. Color is well calibrated and you will enjoy.
10/10",5
"Bought this monitor 10 days back. Working good till now. The picture quality is decent. There is a bit of back light bleeding, but very less. I guess its a normal phenomena for LCD monitors. If your unit has excessive back light bleeding consider replacing it.

The only issue I see is the poor build quality. There are gaps at the bottom bezel, very delicate and overall fit and finish doesn't feel strong enough. This will eventually reduce the life of the product.

Overall a decent monitor. If you have the money to spend, I would suggest to do more research and buy a monitor with a better build quality. Giving it 4 stars out of 5.",4
"It's been almost a decade since I bought a monitor and am extremely happy I bought this one.

The bezels are minimal and the matte is really effective.

The monitor pops a little bit front from the stand and requires a little space at the back because the HDMI jack's pop out.",5
"The product is worth buying. It is really good in tearms of build quality and looks.
Monitor comes pre color calibrated and due to ""Black Stabilizer"" like feature, people working 24/7 will not feel stress on eyes. (though you need to set brightness according to you). Monitor Stand is also Stylish, slim and sturdy with matte finish. If compared with 22MQ68VQ i will still recommend this monitor 22MK600M for buying as this is released after 22MQ68VQ and has nice Menu navigation.

Cons :
1. DVI port is absent. (But not all people need that. Its nice to have feature.)",5
"I was looking for a mid range monitor, specifically, did not want to buy a bigger one as i had already one.
I was also looking for monitor other than DELL, was got LG.
Power cord is very slim and does not occupy much space which helps save space and clean is also easier...
Thanks for such a sleek monitor and set was way to easy.
Writing review after 15 days of purchase.",5
"Picture quality is great as colors are nicely calibrated. The speakers are standard and not extraordinary. But as the speakers are downward facing, it enhances the surround effect. Flicker free technology helps in reducing eye strain. The stand is made of metal and is sturdy. There is no backlight bleeding in this unit.",5
"Great monitor the price.

Using it as an extension monitor for the laptop. Full HD display with accurate colors.

Plastic quality could have been better but given the price range this is absolutely fine.

This has got anti reflection coating. I had a Dell monitor at work but this coating alone is sufficient for me to buy this as it reduces eye strain.",5
"The package was good but the product was poor quality. Maybe seller is selling only the defective items from LG. The first monitor I got had black spots on the middle of the display but thanks to Amazon, they replaced my monitor with second one, which has BACK LIGHT DIMMING issue on the BOTH LOWER CORNERS of the DISPLAY. Instead of replacing they told me to refund, but after much thinking I thought of keeping that defective item. Now I have to live with it for at least 5 years. :( Awful experience for me!!!
If display quality is your primary concern please buy at your own risk.",1
Makes wfh a lot easier! This is an amazing buy!,5
"Meets all my requirement for a monitor for Home and Office use. Good picture and build quality. Good looking too. Its light weight too. The stand is elegant but not sufficient. I never intended to use the stand either. I will get a swivel arm to mount the monitor. Using HDMI, we can set up 1920x1080 at 75 Hz frame refresh rate. HDMI cable included in the box but is not very lengthy for my purpose. It has two HDMI ports. Not sure why. Need to explore that aspect.",4
"This is a decent looking monitor. I purchased it for office work and suits well. Good part is installation and usage is quite easy. Fit and finish could be better as the bottom bezel has some gaps from screen. It supports HDMI (2 ports) and VGA which is a good thing as users may require support to both type of ports.
I connected it with my android tv box (also connected to Bluetooth speakers for audio output) and worked absolutely fine. Overall a good product.",4
"The product packaging was so good. Super nice IPS panel resulting beautiful real colors and great viewing angles. Its mentioned on the production that the panel is capable to function on 75hz. But I can't find more 60hz RR..Nice monitor for casual gaming, watching movies, surfing internet and office stuff.. price lil bit higher but the quality will not let you down.",4
"I am writing this review after using it for more than 3 months. I got it from Amazon at 8300. I don't play games usually so this review doesn't covers that point. I usually use it for web surfing, watching movies and web series, photos n video editing.

Pros :
Excellent picture quality.
Quite durable and build quality is superb.
It comes with 2 hdmi ports.
Menu button is smartly fitted below screen which is not visible and you can change variety of settings just through one button.
Quality of hdmi cable provided is good.

Cons:
Nothing as such.
It would have been better if they had provided 1 USB port.

To summarize if you are looking for a good monitor under 10k, you can definitely go for it :)",4
"My primary purpose while buying it was getting my eyes relieved of strain for a change, as I have to read a lot on tablet/phone.. And yes it does the job.. Although display quality can't be compared with amoled or retina display, but viewing big and from a distance soothes your eyes while reading for long.. it's narrow bezel as mentioned.. I use it with Chromecast hdmi tv stick for browsing on chrome and also by mirroring my phone/iPad.. so this combination seems to be an economical option for preparation guys also, instead of buying a desktop pc for browsing.. although Reading mode is present but I prefer to custom adjust the brightness and blue light.. only a very little/negligible cons is that after adjusting brightness to low and decreased blue light in colour adjust, on a white screen the left middle of screen sometimes feels more yellowish than other area, this phenomenon changes while changing viewing angles.. first I thought to replace it.. then in the other reviews I saw people mentioning IPS glow which is common with IPS panel, and replacement doesn't work etc.. so I thought to keep it.. as IPS is considered superior in terms of colour production from VA and TN panel... Blacks and Gamma is also adjustable but didn't required to adjust that settings.. I played many colour checking full hd videos on YouTube and yes the all seems to be playing excellent in low and high brightness both.. I saw many people have complained about made in china, and I too request Amazon and Lg-India to look after people's concern, let it be provided manufactured or assembled in India itself!!!",5
i would like to thanks to amazon for lightning delivery with in one day. i am working in corporate industry. recently my monitor stopped working so temporarily was using LED TV in place of monitor and then i ordered it. trust me you will feel like value for money in this price range. Picture quality is awesome. only one drawback is speaker icon missing but it will be covered with the speaker output 3.5mm jack back side of the screen. so go for it.........,5
"Worth for the Money..
Pros:
1. Viewing angles are good.
2. Picture quality is good.
3. Light weight and thin

Cons (not a major):
1. Headphone out is very hard to insert.
2. No Low brightness (night mode)

Chromecast also works fine...",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Best in class monitor, Blacks are adjustable,
75 hrz Freesync with AMD.

Colours are as good as you need, just as any cool smartphone, just adjust its brightness and contrast according to need, default modes are also good.

Have a look.
Beautiful.
Amazing.",5
"I am using from last 2 days. Its superb. Picture quality is best with 2x5w speaker sound. Look more stylish. I have brought Rs- 9500 with amazon sbi credit card offer.
I have used acer before but LG picture & sound both are better than Acer.",5
"Purchased the monitor in Jul 2020 at ~8.7 k - was delivered within 4 days - color quality was good after minimal adjustments - light bleeding was a serious problem - requested for a return, but Amazon had increased the price and then it went out of stock - prices of other monitors have also increased on Amazon (as on 19 Jul 2020)",1
"This is a very good monitor in this price range. Wide colour range, very good brightness and extremely good contrast ratio. The refresh rate makes everything smooth and your PC will seem faster than what it is. It has all features of a modern gaming monitor.",5
"Super beautiful Full HD display for this price range (Rs8,700). Only issue right now is black screen flickering sometimes when heavy use of graphics card occurs like while gaming. I think this is an issue with my laptop hdmi port or maybe the fact that my laptop has an Nvidea graphics card and this is an AMD freesync monitor. So i would recommend u keep that in mind while purchasing.",4
"I am a developer and developing apps in my 14 inch laptop is very difficult and when watching some tutorials while developing, it is impossible to work smoothly.

I am satisfied with Amazon's service and the product arrived in a great condition. The delivery was quick and totally satisfied with the COVID-19 situation delivery rules!
The display quality is great and you also get 2 HDMI ports, 3.5 mm Audio jack for headphones or speakers. The display is almost bezel-less and it is overall worth the price!

I got it for 7800/- (10% discount with SBI cards)",5
"Large monitor, clear picture, economical - total value for money. This is a very good monitor and has a very good picture quality. I had to spend some time to figure out how to control the brightness and contrast. The buttons are located at the bottom rear side of the monitor, just in front of the stand. The only other flip side that I see is that it does not have a tilt option. LG should introduce tilt in this monitor - it will be very helpful.
Overall this monitor is amazing - indeed a good investment.",5
"Awesome picture quality. There are different presets available like Game Mode, Picture Mode, Cinema, Reading, etc.
Also it's a 75Hz monitor. But when connected to laptop and used as extended display, it drops to laptop refresh rate (for me it's 60Hz).
Has two HDMI, connected laptop in one and PS4 in the other. Works without any problem.
And the joystick to navigate on screen controls is also great.",5
"Bought this LG 22mk600m recently. Received it the next day of ordering, packaging wasn‚Äôt great as it was only wrapped in plastic. It was raining do I was worried about the monitor getting wet but only the corners of the box were damp. After unboxing, I found that the monitor was okay with just a mark of the screen caused due to the thermocol, it went away after I wiped it with a cloth. A CD was also given but just kept without a cover and HD scratches on it. This is the manual CD. I never got the software or driver CD making it impossible for me to change the resolution or refresh rate or access any other advanced settings of the monitor. No way of contacting seller so I have to live with it. That was the only disappointment. Otherwise the monitor is great, no glow no dead pixels or any thing else. Hooked it up to the ps3 and fire stick along with an external speaker. Had to download the software driver from LG for my MacBook and had to order an HdMi to thunderbolt converter as my MacBook does not have an hdmi port. Anyone using a windows please be sure to check the CD you receive with this monitor as I could not fine the software driver online anywhere for windows.",5
"For this price point this is probably the best monitor , Has 2 HDMI inputs , 1 D-SUB and an audio output port. Support freesync if you have a radeon gpu. Good response time . IPS panel has good contrat and color . and Viewing angles are pretty much near 180 degrees without distrotion. No Height adjustment available. But the angle can be adjusted",5
"I had a budget of 7500 so I went for this one and got it for 6800 with amazon offers and found it very much worth it as the screen is amazing for WFH as well as light gaming. No issues whatsoever after month of use.
PS : Screen can be tilted just need to give in some power without thinking much, initially one feels that it will break but it can be tilted easily with little push.",4
"Although the product is bit higher in price !! I am ok to pay that. The picture quality is good, and does the job well .. in case anyone is WFH like I am due to lockdown .. and for more than 10 hours this is a bliss... your spreadsheets are crystal clear and u have an endge on efficiency ... if you are ok with price !! I recommend this product!!",5
"Good monitor works well the colour and brightness is sufficient for day to today work, I am using with my Windows laptop and MacBook Pro, since this monitor has two HDMI port it‚Äôs easy for me to switch between two machines, overall very good monitor, the screen size is really good,

Overall I would recommend this monitor the delivery time was good.",5
"Been 3 days with the monitor. So far so good.
Display is great. Colours are good as well. No issues with any thing apart from screen bleeding.
Present at the top and left and ride side
Of the screen. As a designer on a budget, this is slightly irritating but for 7.5k + Offers, it‚Äôs worth it.
If you are getting the Dell SE2219HX at a good deal, go for it. No issues with that at all, doesn‚Äôt have screen bleeding as much as this does.",4
"Pros:
Sleek design
Picture quality is good
Low power consumption
Table tap stand is sylish
2 Hdmi ports

Cons:
Bad viewing angle
Screen bleeding issue (showing yellow shade in all edges)
Black level is poor
No led notification
Bad adapter cable quality
No driver cd include only manual cd included
No speaker
No eye saver option is available or low blue light option",3
"The good thing about this monitor is that it comes with 1 d-sub, 2 HDMI, 1 audio jack. I am using this monitor for my laptop, my CPU, and also my android tv stick. See how many ways you can use a single monitor. It also has a 1080p resolution which gives me a good view, my laptop has a 720p resolution. There is no doubt that this monitor is way useful for many things. LG has done a good thing but this product comes from China which I didn't like.",5
Its no 75 hz wrong model name,1
"The stand is not strong and quite shaky. Even the slightest movement causes they monitor to wobble. Screen quality is good, no complaints so far. Two hdmi cable support is good if you have two laptops which you can connect without removing and plugging in again. You can just switch the hdmi input with the button on the monitor.",4
"There is no option adjust brightness, only power button is available. Screen quality is not good, looks like every word is blown by the wind. Very disappointed with purchase. Unable to return now as window is closed. Could not check screen quality as the combo Keyboard received with it had missing parts and had to return it. Very poor packaging of the Keyboard. This monitor is not worth this price.",1
"I was confused among LG, Samsung, HP and AOC and after conducting research finally bought this from Amazon. My friends are using HP and AOC 22 inch 1080p IPS panel. believe me, this is the best IPS panel you could get as the colours are calibrated from the factory and the brightness level is very high. The viewing angle is excellent as it is an IPS display. The AOC panel is nowhere near this however HP is better than AOC but in my eyes, I can say this monitor's panel is the best. without hesitating go for this monitor...
It is not a gaming monitor however you can play games on any monitors... For media consumptions and editing work go for this monitor",5
"Amazon service are good but
I get 2time diffective product lg 22mk600
1st one have 2 yellow shadow,
2nd have one yellow shades,

Right corner black color is black
But left side black is grey with yellow shades.

You cant find this issue normally but this issue easily shown in pure black wallpaper.

If u get perfect product without any issue
This moniter colours are awesome, and good moniter .",1
"Do NOT buy if are programmer. Texts are highly pixelated. Screen is too bright for eyes at its lowest brightness setting.

Its good for media consumption. Full HD videos looks like OLED experience.",2
"The whites on this monitor appear like pale gray color. Very disappointed. Ordered for a replacement. I will update after I get the replacement.

I changed brightness, contrast, Gamma Mode etc, and nothing seems to make any difference.",3
"Good product from LG, perfect clarity, full HD, using os a desktop monitor + as Tv, sound quality and volume is loud enough. ""But refresh rate is only 60Hz & not 75Hz.",5
"HONEST REVIEW
what do I like about this monitor?
The split-screen function is awesome, audio output for speakers, matt finish screen, display quality is awesome, best in the budget, best in 22 inches without thinking twice.

The only net picking is the monitor does not tilt. so you need to use an aftermarket stand for it.
9/10 for this monitor.

NOTE- PLEASE ALWAYS SEE MANUFACTURING DATE OF PRODUCT, DON'T DECIDE JUST BY NUMBER OF REVIEWS",4
I have ordered on prime day. I have got product internally damaged. Please make sure refund or replacement is made as soon as possible.,1
"This monitor is so beautifull i love it but as soon as i used it in dark room this thing happend bad bleeding yellowiha tint on the left side replaced but same thing with second pieve hve to return
dont buy",1
"i brought this monitor for pairing with an old laptop, and it functions smoothly. The screen size and display are good and provides a good feel to the desk with its sleek design. The sound output is ok for meeting in a closed environment, however not enough for a good experience o f movies or music. works well for work from home and online classes.
the delivery was smooth and was nicely packaged without any defect",5
"Excellent display and light weight.Due to online classes, I have ordered this monitor to connect to my laptop. This worked like a charm. Now my son spends 3hrs on this screen for his online school classes without any hassle.",5
this monitor is good but the adjustment of brightness and color need to be done manually and it irritating btw amazing picture quality with 5 ms response time . i will update this after usage time to time,4
"I don't know much about Technicalities. i kmow it's IPS panel. worth of money
but I loved it great picture quality is far far better then my hp laptop.
For my online shop i purchase it. You won't regret for a single rupees. go for it if your budget allowed you to buy this",5
"its okay monitor. I don't know much about 1080p monitors as 1st time user i think it has good picture quality but resolution wise not much satisfied, don't know if this is the case of all 1080p monitors but the resolution felt average for me as I could see every pixels and when the icon/letters/pictures or anything that is small the borders and pixels lining could be easily seen which makes me very much annoying for doing work. Gaming wise also it is mostly same.",3
"After connecting this monitor to my lenovo X1 carbon, the laptop has lost its audio. Even after disconnecting the monitor from the laptop, the sound does not work. It works sometimes after rebooting the laptop, but again loses it after some time. I disabled the monitor speaker from sound settings so that I only have the laptop speaker.
But that did not help. My laptop no longer playes audio from its own speaker and that is very frustrating :-(((",1
"if you are buying this monitor, you are quite possibly upgrading from a TN panel, compared to that the picture quality is on an another level, but there are better options for picture quality, like the mp68vq which has a native 8 bit panel, while this has a 6 bit+frc, but this has an out of box refresh rate of 75hz, while the mp68vq needs to be overclocked to reach that level, the color temps were quite warm for my taste, but they can be changed from the settings, mine has slight issue that the cap on my stand doesn't fit properly, but that's jus me being nitpicky",4
"Arrived two days early in a neat package and amazon delivery is great and I see a good amount of light brightness in top of the screen. apart from this con, i did find this product a good, cheap and value for money.",4
Status does my necessity. One thing I am not liking in it is the space between the bottom Belem and the screen,5
"I bought this monitor for my Mac.

But it has weird flickering effects which runs horizontally.

I don't know if mine is defective, or it's just the feature.

However I don't like it.",2
Features are as described but there is one major problem - the lighter colors such as blue and green are not rendered smoothly. It appears to be like vertical lines drawn close to each other (hard to capture on camera). This IS a problem with the panel. There has been a review on LG official website stating this issue as well. Amazon is NOT accepting returns although I'm a prime member and asked me to go to LG service center. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!,2
"It's awesome.
Bought it in 2019.
Still no issues at all.
Best display.
No inbuilt speakers.
Only issue is it has a shiny plastic body. It is getting scratches very easily.",5
"I dont know how to articulate this but whenever i scroll an article, i can see a trail of words which feels disturbing to eyes. Same thing happens when there is movement of high contrast images on screen. ok for watching movies.",3
Best display,5
I particularly bought this monitor for ps4 gaming. I usually play warzone on PlayStation but it's really hard to see enemies on TV so I bought this one to improve my gameplay. if you are looking to buy PlayStation 4 monitor go for this one.,5
"I brought this after lots of research. It worked well and fit all my requirements. Could have been better if it's comes with default VGA cable..but it was alright since most of new laptops now comes with HDMI. I got my custom setup and screen setting options are also good. Works well with office laptop and personal..and also good for gaming and watching peacefully movie.
I give 5 stars üåü.",5
"(Posting after using a 3 days.) All went well. Got it with Rs. 7.5K in Sale. Picture quality is nice, no screen bleeding, best budget IPS monitor softwares like Adobe premiere pro, color reproduction is nice.",5

Product is Made in China except that I am satisfied with purchase.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Amazing display loved it better than my old acer vg240y 75 hz monitor. I think Colours are slightly contrasty. Thank you amazon you delivered the order in time and without any damage. No dead pixel. If you are looking for a monitor under 10000 or around 9000 just blindly buy it. It gives you the perfect 75 hz you have to do it in advanced display setting.",5
"Use at least 2 days continuosly than check how was quality because I am facing lower refresh rate after 2 days fixed the problem,
Premium looking everything is great
Review after 7 days

I purchased this monitor for productivity purpose and this monitor produced best picture quality under 7.5k with 75hz refresh rate. It has some backlight bleeding issues but it is normal for any ips monitors. The bleeding issues are only noticable in camera. It's not noticable in your eyes,5
"This is the best budget monitor i have ever used.
Better than any other brand at this price.
75hz refresh rate gaming
What a true colour experience amazing & many more.
No bleeding, no dead pixel , its great you can't imagine guys at this price range.

LG ROCKS üëç",5

Pros:
- Amazing image quality.
- Even at zero brightness it is very bright.
- Lot of options in picture settings.
Con:
- No height adjustment available. can only be tilted a bit.
- Audio out port at the back is just terrible. You'd better off without it.
- Minor backlight bleeding issues but can only be seen on dark background.",4
this is the best monitor i got at this price range. its full hd and doesn't heat at all. power adapter is way handy and works flawless on all types of videos and viewing purpose. Its IPS bezel less panel so no issue of any viewing angles. Works well on gaming also.,5
"Great product by LG, I love the picture quality, however, I have not used it for Gaming.
What I did not like was that it needs a separate DC adapter and that the length of the adapter cable is slightly short for my purpose. However, no regrets and I highly recommend this product.",5
Got the defective product 2 times. Very bad experience with amazon.,1
"The customer service sucks, I've called and complained 4 times to date, No resolution.
Buy the monitor at your own risk. If it works fine, great. If it doesn't work you are screwed because there's zero customer support.",1
As a product it is good. I was looking for monitor with adjustable height. This product will not allow to do that. So I returns the same and bought a dell one. Thanks amazon for allowing me to return this product,4
"If you are on tight budget and want a Full HD ips monitor go for it .if you are an gamer no problem if you are a content creator and doing work with colour grading
Or something I don't recommend this it habacklight bleeding on top. I applied for replacement and renew this comment.",3
Nice picture quality .....set top box to tv connect (hdmi port only) on my monitor .....,4
"you can not adjust height or rotate the monitor as per flexibility ,generally we are expecting that from any monitor, but that is the big MISSSSSSSS
No where mentioned that , 90% people requires that feature , and they wont accept for refund also",1

"Design is very elegant, slim bezels, modern.
Display quality is as good as it can get for an IPS 1080p. Nice colors, contrast. There's slight IPS glow, which is expected. Not backlight bleed in my unit, which is awesome.

Stand could be better, a little wobbly, and more adjustments would be welcome for this expensive monitor.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Great picture quality...!! One of the best in this price range. I suggest you go for it if you're looking for a good IPS Screen for media consumption as well as work. I think even 24 inch would have been great. I got the 22 inch one but it's great too.",4
"The product is good and expectations fulfiller.
Inbuilt speakers are of nice quality.
Have decent look for my office.
And of course great service by Amazon.
Initially I received defective piece which got replaced within 7 days. Thanks to Amazon customer service.
Overall great buy in this range.",4
"Good reduced bezel screen pic (still there is, it's a marketing thing to sell ), but LG should lower the price with the 75Hz refresh rate I belive 6999 RS is a little bit higher.

Overall the product is good for daily use, won't disappoint you.",4
Decent product for WFH use,4
"Great for coding and regular uses, great color accuracy and reader mode works greatly, total worth it. The speakers are loud and clear, not to good for music but great for movies and youtube.",5
"Good One, As listed it serves the purpose. Value for money. Was not aware that, it comes with HDMI cable, so the one I bought become standby. Good product, Nicely packed, easy to assemble.",5
I have been using it for last 2 months. Working as expected. I do not see any issues. Reading mode is good for longtime working.,5

"Second LG monitor, the 1st one (ev22) lasted 9 years. Satisfied with the purchase.

However the HDMI portal could have be placed better, not a deal breaker though.",5
Reader mode is comfortable. I enjoy reading the ebooks of competitive examination.,5
"Everything's fine but the display brightness does not get too low. My eyes strain while using it at night. Other than that, everything's fine. And also it's better if they have included an led indicator to show whether it's on or off. And also it's better if it has a movable stand.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Gap between frame and panel three side top , left, and right, manufacturers don't fix it using glu.
Replaced this.",4
"If you sit front of the monitor then you can see the pixels clearly although its looks like they used a cheap ips panel with poor viewing angles and thats what i don't really like also it comes with a backlight bleed on the corner. Worst experience with lg monitor,, not suggesting anyone.",1
"Lg is known for picture quality displays, its the best in price the description and the product works as it is no cheating.",5
"Useful for WFH setup. Small text does not come up as sharp as 14 inch laptop, but that's expected from 24 inch screen with 1080p resolution.
Comes with 2 HDMI inputs which is helpful for laptop + PS4 connectivity.",5
"Excellent. First time received defective piece. I returned it. Then after, I received a new excellent product. It's working good right now. Thanks for quick response.",5
"Audio port not working properly
Good picture quality
Decent viewing angle
Small bezels but theirs no display till the edge
Decent for the price paid",4
"Worth for 11K. Screen Quality is the advantage. Full HD Videos works fine in this screen but while playing 4K videos it will get stuck for a second.
Quality of Speaker are not upto mark but you can connect external speaker for getting audio.",5
"The monitor itself is great. However the manual says it comes with one HDMI cable, one VGA cable and two power adapters. The box I received did not have the VGA cable and the second power adapter. I don't know if that's the case for everyone or just me.",4

"Yes. I think this is a good product at this price. Viewing angles are just fine. It got nice asthetics compared to other monitors at this price range. I never expected any crazy display specs from this device, so I can say my purchase is worth it. Will update if any issues in the future.",5

This model has a very bad issue which is not supposed to be there in LG branding monitor. It has vey low Pixel density and for that this display looks pixelated. It's slightly different from LG 22mp64vq. LG 22mp64vq is far better than this one. 22mp64vq has a very good resolution and is best monitor under 10000/- price range. Those who have come to this review section should go for 22mp64vq.,1
Don't buy dead pixel,1
I had used this display before also and when I require another display I bought this again for design work and day to day work it's picture quality is really good compare to its price and its look latest also with very small Basel on three sides.,5
What is the difference between this and LG 22MP68VQ?,5
"Very good monitor and accurate colours, but nearly same specs monitor is also available from Samsung for 7999 (at the time of writing) so that makes it a little less value for money. But LG is worth it üòâ.",4
Yaa there r some some noise in screen if u see soo clearly but trust me it's best out of this BUGGET panel and picture r soo bright and clear...also best for gaming if u have a under BUGGET of 10k just go for it,4
The stand is not stable and it tilts a little towards the front. Really LG needs to look at this because this is a monitor with a high price with all its ranges.,3
"The product would have been nice ,if only I would‚Äôve got it, the shipping is worst it has been around a month now but still I didn‚Äôt got the product,
Really disappointed.",2

When I play any sd channel the picture feel like hd picture, and hd channel picture feel like 4k picture.It has 19v power input, I am connect a 12v supply to this monitor it run smoothly. I am run this monitor continue 6 hours, but it was not heated like other monitor.",5
Until now it's excellent,5
Good product. Resolution is good. Both VGA and HDMI working. One HDMI cable should be added. Value for money.,4
"This monitor fraud with us, Because this monitor has tn-panel but this is not mentioned in description I don't love this monitor. And also I'm not using this monitor from the day it arrived at my home. And for gaming there is better monitor in market with ips display. I dont recommend this monitor for budget gamers also.",1
Serves the purpose and it works fine. Good for office use. Or Work from home and use it as a secondary screen.,4
"Decent enough monitor. Didn‚Äôt face any issue. Packed well. Working as expected.

All buttons are provided at the back of the monitor. Bit inconvenient. As we wont change settings freq, it is ok.",4

Not IPS display. Viewing angle is very narrow.,4
Though the product supplied too good without any complain but one thing I must say that while talking to the courier guy I asked him repeatedly that to hand over the product to me and not to the security guy ..but still it was delivered to the security guard that was really disappointing..these courier guys never follow the instructions...apart from this everything was ok,5
Good monitor. Working perfectly. no defects found. Good display quality. There is vga and hdmi in it all two are working perfectly. Good item at this rate.,4
"I bought it because i had only 4k budget at the time and thought of buying a gaming monitor after some time.
But now i regret i bought it. I should have took some more money from my friends to buy a good monitor.

"See images, product is rated for an input of 1.5A and the power cord provided is rated for an input of 16A.

You don't need 16A to power a 24"" 1080p monitor. Even a 55"" 4k TV with HDR doesn't need this much power. Plus the monitor is only rated for 21W, which is not much at all. Now I need to spend extra to either get an after market power cord which will essentially void my warranty or to spend extra on an electrician for the '16A' socket.",1
"No doubt the monitor is good for what I do but the package received had a 16A power plug(big one) which is totally unnecessary for this 21W monitor, and I hate to sit and work in kitchen or in the bathroom which is where we have these bigger sockets in home.",3
"I was strict on budget and the best options I found out were Dell s2421hn, Acer HA240Y and Acer Nitro. Acer offers speakers at same price point but I'm inclined to purchase Dell due to brand value and service as I wasn't sure how good is Acer service network. Out of above three best vfm is Acer Nitro you'll find it priced at 10k occasionally and try to grab it if you are willing to purchase Acer.
Pros:
- Perfect for office usage, movies and occasional gaming
- Great display quality at this price point
- Height is perfectly aligned to eye level
- Inbuilt display customization. I use it at lowest brightness at most of the times and RTS color settings.
Cons:
- When compared to competitors specifically Acer, Ben Q they could have offered speakers as well. I use external speakers so it doesn't matter. If you need speakers in dell monitor go for S2421H model and for Height adjustment go for S2421HS (not sure if it's launched in India yet)
- This isn't a con specifically it comes with 16 A socket. Research before purchasing instead of rating a product 1 star as the product and it's attachments aren't as you expected. External 6A-16A adapter will suffice and can be purchased at local store for 80 INR at max. depends on your locality

If you need additional usb ports opt for P2419H as it has 4 usb ports and comes with height adjust ability too.

Overall I would say it's a bang for buck.",5
"- I needed a monitor for my home use since I am using laptops (Office and Personal) both side by side.
- Since the Monitor has dual HDMI ports, it becomes easier to switch between two laptops.
- The screen size of 24 inches is more than sufficient for office applications (Email, Office365, Teams etc) and excellent for Internet browsing, YouTube videos.
- I am using this monitor in a bright room having ample of Sunlight and its very comfortable to use.
- Current settings are set to medium brightness and contrast and it still gives very good results
- I am not into gaming so cannot comment on that
- Make sure you order a 5/6 amps pin computer cable as well, which I got for @200 on Amazon.
- Screen bezels are very narrow and that keeps the physical size of monitor comparitively less.
- Highly recommended for Home Office use. I am totally satisfied with the performance.",5
THIS PRODUCT SPEND EXTRA MONEY FOR 16A BOARD OR SOCKET,1
Very good quality monitor from dell. I primarily use it as secondary monitor for programming. The text is crisp and the monitor is really bright also this has a premium built quality unlike other monitors from samsung and benq in this price range. Only con is the port situation. Research before buying if you are planning for a dual monitor setup.,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Picture quality is Good not that great. There is too much Ghosting in monitor. Dell website states that this model has three Responce time; 8 ms (grey-to-grey normal); 5 ms (grey-to-grey fast); 4 ms (grey-to-grey extreme) For casual use like typing or watching video its ok. But 5ms and 4ms is non usable. You can't game or do 3d modeling in 8ms. Responce time of 5ms or 4ms gives Ghosting effect which is unbearable for me. I have attached Video for example.

P.s I have asus mx239h which is 5 year old monitor and it has superior picture quality and no ghosting(4ms responce). And I bought it for 14500rs.. 5 years ago.",3
"This monitor is a descent screen with IPS panel, crisp images and text and serves the purpose well if you are looking for a monitor to do office work. looks are good and comes with a dell brand assurance .
The 16A plug is not a deal breaker since you can get a 1A to 16A adapter anywhere in an electrical shop for Rs 70.",5

"You can blindly trust Dell products but make sure you are buying them from a LEGIT seller. Because these monitors are just wow. FHD monitor for 8K. I really wanted to buy a dual monitor and earlier thinking about buying the Samsung curved one but checked reviews and found a lot of customers were complaining about color accuracy. Also, The price was comparatively higher. Hence, opt for these. Happy with the purchase but the power cord supplied with the monitor is a 16AMP. Usually, we don't have too many 16 A sockets in our house, Even I have tried getting a 16 A extension board also but didn't work out. Finally, I figured this out.

Solution- Get a 16A to 6A converter that would cost you around 50 bucks. i am using CONA which is working perfectly fine for me.",5
"Most of the specifications given in the description is made up just for marketing & sale, this monitor work fine for general use. Not suitable for professional use where color reproduction & gamut range is important.",2
awesome product ......one must buy it ....only thing is it should have VGA port too .rest all is fine.one can buy it,5
"Value for money,best in all cases,budget friendly gives you premium looks and feel,so go for this without any hesitation.its blasted",5
"I purchased this model not knowing it's a VA Panel. But then convinced me to use it. As soon as it's powered, I felt very bad buying this monitor. Firstly it was defective, there was an annoying green pattern on the display. In addition to that, Thunderbolt(USB C) did not work with MAC. After having a bad experience, called support to return the product. The support personnel wasn't patient enough, not even sympathetic. outright informed me to keep using the defective monitor. After a long escalation and multiple calls, finally, they accepted for replacement instead of return. Once again decided to give it a try. Received a second one, this time packaging and the box were in bad shape. Then anyway started to use the monitor. After an hour or two started noticing a green tint on the screen and the display going blank every 10 - 30 mins. It will remain there for over a second or two. It was really annoying as well. Then called the support and this time the support personal accepted the defect by seeing the picture and the return was completed.

This is one of the bad experiences I had with Amazon. I would recommend staying away from the 32-inch model. 32UL750.",1
"This is an excellent 4K display and well worth the premium. I use it with my M1 Mac Mini and the colour reproduction, brightness and quality of picture are excellent. Even the speakers are surprisingly loud (don't expect it to be replace a high-quality external speaker like Bose Companion though). It comes with an USB C port with pass-through power delivery. I connect it to my work laptop (Dell Latitude 54i0) through its Thunderbolt 3 port and the experience is painless. I have never done serious gaming in it - except for 1-2 Apple Arcade games, so I can't provide detailed comments on that. Overall, an excellent product - highly recommended.",5
"Wanted a LG 32UL950 with an IPS panel but settled for this instead due to no stock.

Many people have complained about the panel being a VA and not an IPS. While I admit it's annoying that the luminance gets shifted a bit if viewing from odd angles, this is meant to be used as a monitor and not a TV. Therefore, despite its technological disadvantage I'm happy to sit in front of it and experience rather good picture quality.

Pros:
* This one monitor replaced my : 1) Laptop charger 2) USB-C dongle and hub 3) HDMI cables 4) multi-pin spike buster into a truly single cable solution. One plug to the wall, one cable to the laptop and everything works.
* Display is huge, no stuck pixels, color reproduction is almost as good as a macbook pro
* Integrated USB hub, plugged my keyboard/mouse there
* Height adjust stand is pretty nice IMO

Cons:
* There's some minor ghosting of white moving text on black backgrounds but its fine for casual gaming or movie watching
* Large monitor surface and therefore some amount of glare can be visible on screen, have to turn up brightness during sunny days
* Bezels are 1cm thick (thin?) since it's a VA panel but atleast its symmetrical on all sides so doesnt look too bad. Great for webcams that have a lip",5
Good product. Its a 32 inch VA panel. Looks good. A bit overpriced though. Should be purchased during a sale.,5
Nice monitor value for money,5
"Excellent gaming monitor. Very bright for a TN panel. HDR support is excellent
Best size for ppl confused between 24inch or 27 inch monitor.
I recommend for gamers. Height adjust at this price is a steal
Stand is sturdy and solid
Comes with only HDMI cable. U will have to buy DP cable if u need. HDMI supports 144hz so no need to worry.
I'm happy with the product.",5
"This Monitor have heating issue and the front part of monitor heated, not too much but yup it heats after use 1 hr. You feel kinda blurness in it. Fadeed color. I feels like my eye got some problem but it is in this monitor you feel .Its not for content creater or watching movie as well. I planed to return this and take my money back.",2
"Quick Delivery. Nicely Packed.Easy Assembly.
Great Picture Quality considering its a TN panel and a really bright panel. Hdmi cable included. Using it on144 hz no issues so far to use gsycn you have to use DP which is not included. Stand is really sturdy and panel doesn't wobble. People complaining about dull colours need to get their eyes checked.

I wish it was a 2k panel coz you can see pixels if you sit close to the monitor.",5
"So the Monitor is pretty good compared to other monitors(Acer.etc) Cheap ones. Other cheap monitors comes with a lot of quality control issues. Damaged Screens(White Shots.etc). Now I have seen some dumb people say that this monitor is not good compared to IPS.... Obviously IPS is in its own league.
You can definitely go with this monitor. Better buy it on Amazon because you can return it easily if there is any small issue which is not possible if you buy it via a local dealer.",5
"This monitor works fine for a few weeks and the runs into all sorts of issues with the panel and the replacement that Lenovo sends has even further issues. From my current experience, it would be best to avoid Lenovo when it comes to displays as they clearly have some sort of a quality issue and their customer support is absolutely pathetic.",1
"The picture quality is decent for a TN Panel. Didn't experience any ghosting, corona or artifacts at higher overdrive levels. The stand is pretty sturdy. Though the display claims to support HDR, I wasn't able to get it to work.
The HDMI cable it comes with is a high speed one.",5
"Already in love with this Beauty, It packs 144hz and Extremely Solid Build Quality for the price.
100% Recommended.",5
Not recommended for fps games. I doubt if it's truly 1ms. So much blurring while sprinting nd while fast crosshair movements. Brightness is good. Picture quality is decent for a TN panel.,4
Over brightness. Only for gaming. Not recommended for office use.,4
Supports 144hz over hdmi. Very satisfied :),5

Best of all gaming monitors,5
"I had bought S2218H and used that since last 3 years. The texts are very smooth in that as well the picture quality is Full HD.
Now needed to upgrade and bought this one, But this monitor which is a successor of S2218H, is not anything as compared to the old version. The texts in this monitor looks grainy. You can't read texts properly when looking from near.
I don't know why Dell made this, This has no Speakers, the image quality is also very low. Had to return it.
I think Dell's ""S"" model is the best quality, ""SE"" are the cheaper and low quality ones.",1
"Value for money.
So Crisp in display.
I used it as my daily monitor. I had CRT monitor so initially I connected this monitor using a VGA Cable but then there was distortion present and the pic quality was low as well.
So, I have added a basic Graphics card and using HDMI cable which got free with this monitor the display quality I got was far better.
Its stylish and easy to assemble.
Value for money, but before buying it make sure you have graphics card on your system.",5
Guys don't buy this monitor colour reproduction is average... just Go for Lg 22mp68vq which have superb colour quality. I returned this and bought lg monitor!!!,1

Right out of the gate you can see major difference in the monitor to the left. It even doesn‚Äôt match the symmetrical proportions of the one on the right. The colour produced is so dull and inaccurate. Now either the manufacturer Dell makes every one of their unit differently and doesn‚Äôt bother about their products authenticity or this seller is false!",1
Who gives a power cord with a 15 ampere plug for a monitor? All computer essentials come with 6 amp plugs. What is wrong wiwtth Dell? And Amazon won't even take it back! So I'm stuck with a useless monitor until I find a 6 ampere power cord in these lockdown times!,2
"Good and fast delivery by amazon but when I opened the amazon box, saw the Dell monitor box seal was already broken, hence returned the product immediately. Request to seller not to send such product to customers.",1
"This monitor doesn't have built in speakers. Display is little blurred, not a clear display.. please don't buy it.. there are better options available.. its not even returnable unless damaged.. Don't go for the 7 days return policy..",1
"Worth every penny. Too happy with the results. Only pathetic thing was that the dell box was damaged not sure if seal was tempered or what.

So 2 star for packaging",4
Just Ok. Picture Quality is not satisfactory. Text on screen appears hazy. Not recommended. Better to go for S2218H. Feel cheated.,2

"I was cheated into buying this monitor as it said it was Made In India, however when I saw the Box later it turned out to be Made In China..!!",1
I definitely like the sleek look that it has because of the thin bezel around the screen.,5

It is a very good monitor. I think all people giving low rating bcz of its sharpness.. HDMI cable should be use for best and clean quality. If you use normal VGA cable then picture quality will be very poor.only bad thing about this monitor is it don‚Äôt provide VGA cable inside the box.I am using it from last 7 days I aslo Faced problem with quality but now all good...‚ò∫,5
"I bought this product in offline market for 8800 rupees. The monitors quality is pretty great. The bezels are thin and the color reproduction is awesome. The size is just perfect and it is not at all blurry.
TWO IMPORTANT things here.
1. you need a quality HDMI cable, HDMI port and a good graphics processor on your pc/laptop
2. you need updated device drivers on your pc.
IF thats taken care of. this monitor is a joy to watch and work on.

This is worst monitor i ever seen. don't go for it. colors are not gud and your eyes will damage.only we can view movies. for any office work or general work it's worst monitor,1

"If you're the kind of person who is using it for watching movies(especially at night), for casual gaming, and for general purpose usage, this is the best 27"" monitor that you can find under 10k

Regarding the VA panel, the colours are punchy, ink-y blacks with zero backlight bleed and viewing angles are decent to good.. I doubt you'll get the same level of blacks and contrast on an IPS panel at this price point let alone 27 inches

And yes, the ppi is terrible and is very noticeable while doing my office work, but setting the scale to 110% masks it to some extend and it's the only tradeoff you got to make in this panel.. and considering a 2k panel for slightly better sharpness is over 2x the price of this, it's simply not worth it.

Also, this is not colour accurate or HDR compliant nor has HRR but for a general user, these compromises are acceptable for the price you're getting it. Also, it does not have inbuilt speakers and anyone who has a monitor with inbuilt speakers won't even consider it as a con as they're usually very feeble

Overall, I'd recommend this monitor over any other 24"" monitor available at this price category just for the sheer VFM and quality panel that it offers

And for people thinking about viewing angles as this is not IPS, check out the Lizard pic that I have attached in 3 different angles and trust me, it's not bad and it's definitely a great tradeoff for the deep blacks and zero backlight bleed that it shows head-on which no IPS panel in this price or even 2 levels higher cannot match. Also to note the fact that the monitor will be viewed head-on (+ or - 10 degrees) 95% of the time",5
"Picture quality is superb, but you have to keep a distance of minimum 3 feet from the display.
75Hz on hdmi doesnt seem any different from 60Hz.
For continous hours of work, this monitor is perfect.
For light gaming, its good.
For videos, excellent.
I havent tested heavy gaming, so no idea.
The images are taken at one finger distance from display.(~3inch)
Your eyes wont feel any stress reading/working on this monitor.",5
Fantastic monitor. I went with VA panel as I needed it for watching Netflix. No issues connecting to MacBook. It also works well with Apple TV. Turning off Apple TV puts it in standby mode. Picture quality is nice. I use DCR and the contrast is great. I use it on 60Hz through HDMI port. I couldn‚Äôt find 75Hz setting and don‚Äôt have VGA cable to test that.,5
"Amazon & seller did a good job
Excellent monitor
Picture clarity is great
This monitor is anti-glare
It wasn't mentioned properly & no one was able to clarify either.
60hz
It has AMD free sync

I never thought Lenovo monitor will be this great. But it is. And I am happy recommend this to everyone.",5
"Guys I am using this monitor for more than 2 months now. Picture quality is absolutely great considering the price point. Obviously if you are graphic designer/ video editor or gamer then you may need a better refresh rate 4 K monitor, but if you need this for day to day work like WFH and using as secondary screen then go for it. I do watch you tube videos' on this as well no issue so far.

3 sides bezel are really very minimal, so yeah its stylish looking monitor.

Monitor base is actually bit big so pro is that it will give you monitor a strong base and con is it will take good amount of space at your desk. But for that you can go for any monitor stand.

Overall Thumbs up.",4
The product is amazing. The screen can be customised to your personal preference. It can be wall mounted as it is Vesa capable. I have it mounted on the wall. It is very ergonomic as I can use it for both work and personal use. I am impressed at the monitor for the price. It is definitely value for money. The picture quality is amazing. I mainly wanted a monitor to be mounted on the wall and with my budget this was the only one offering this option.,5
"Product is very low quality. I received the product on 21April,2021 and it is less than 9days and screen is showing vertical lines.

Vertical lines on screen are due to loose connection which do appear after years of usage but within 9days speaks about product quality.

Please avoid this product.",1
"I wanted to wait one month before reviewing just to see how well it holds up, so far so good, can't complain for price to performance ratio you are getting what you pay for or even more, i got it in 10k and i would say that it's worth it, i have not tested for gaming but i consume lot of media i have hooked up MI Box and my laptop with Hdmi switch. So far the picture quality and colors are really nice. Worth a buy..",5
"All things are good in this monitor. But if they also provide inbuilt speakers then it would be too good.
This monitor is good for programming with big 27‚Äù screen in low budget",5
"Picture quality will not disappoint you. FHD Resolution looks very good and impressive at both VGA&HDMI. You need to change display frequency to 75hz and it does work like charm. Cannot compare with UHD/4K resolution monitors but at this (10k) price, monitor is really good. Design and bezel less display is very attractive too and you won‚Äôt feel that your money is wasted.",5
"If you are looking for work from home setup, for God's sake please don't buy this product.
- Video quality given by 1980 1080 is terrible.
I'm basically a game developer. This display quality is never suited for purchase!
Bought this today and my eyes have starts paining by sitting for about an hour!

Please see to this product from somebody else before buying this.",1
Cant find a 27inch monitor for this price. Pretty decent for office work. No speakers included so you may need a separate speakers.,5
"Value for money, this 27 inch monitor is pure fhd 1080, i played 4k videos on youtube, its crystal clear. And the main purpose of this monitor is to use as second screen for my laptop, which it performed V well and i am happy with the clarity and matt finish.",5
"I really like this screen. Easily syncs with your PC/Laptop. With price of 11K and 27"" screen size I did not find other better option in the market. Packaging was really good by the seller and picture quality of screen is really good.",5
"At this price I can not think of anything better. Perfect in everyway.
Also its actually more stylish than it looks in real life.",5
"Good product. its been a month that i started using. No issues Till Date.
Only issue was there were some minute gaps between the screen and the bottom frame. But the screen itself doesn`t seems to have any issues.",4
"Very reasonable . I searched a lot but in this price no 27"" monitor is available. Picture quality is very good for watching movies. Easy to assemble. Audio quality is ok.",5
Not apt for gaming or graphics designing. No true colours. Backlight seems high brightness. Just can use as a resource monitor/TV,2
Black is not black on this monitor and the colors are not good. Useable only for documentation,2
"Product is no doubt offers a great value, build is decent considering the price. Only if it would have been made in india, I would have vowed for it ...",4
"It's a good monitor for office work, I also occasionally use it to watch movies, audio out port is helpful to attach external speakers",5
"The monitor does what it says in the description. It might not be the best 27"" FHD monitor you can buy, but it surely is very good value for money",5
Good if Speakers could have been provided..‚òπÔ∏èüôÇ,4
I am unhappy with this monitor as it went non functional from the second day itself..,1
Picture quality is thrilling. Only demerit is it doesn't have inbuilt speaker. 5/5,5

"I really like this monitor, there is no glare from using the screen and I find it very comfortable using it with my laptop for long periods of time also.

It is definitely a good recommendation to purchase this monitor!",5
"Purchased on june 15 2021,
Best value for money available on Amazon",5
"In the photos there is the side-by-side comparison between Dell P2419H & HP 24F. I own both. Here is is my subjective review focusing on the two purpose which I will be using the monitors for: programming and consumption of multimedia content.

In favor of Dell:
1. Deeper blacks.
2. Lower IPS glow.
3. More natural looking colors.
4. USB hub (1 upstream, 4 downstream)
5. DisplayPort 1.2 with DP cable included.
6. Better functioning stand. (height, tilt and angle adjustment)
7. Vesa mount compatible.
8. Better calibration out of the box.
9. Lower response time at 6ms vs 14ms on HP.
10. Cleaner cable management (included stand can be used).
11. Lesser color/brightness/contrast shift at extreme angles. (really knit picking at this point)
12. Better build (HP has slight gap between bezel and display as visible in a corner closeup picture)
13. Ever so slightly thinner bezels on Dell.

In favor of HP:
1. Looks sexy as hell. (thinner panel and modern looking stand)
2. Brighter display at 300nits vs 250nits on the Dell.
3. More vibrant colors. (but also less natural, so your choice)

Also in favor of HP (but only if using for Gaming)
4. Higher refresh rate at 75 Hz vs 60 Hz on the Dell (but remember, HP also has worse response time at 14ms vs 6ms on the Dell)
5. AMD FreeSync support.

Conclusion: Things that matter most to me are present on the Dell and hence, more love to Dell but no hate to HP either. You can't go wrong with either.

Purchase: Costed me 14.5K before discounts and brilliant fast delivery by Amazon and ZRPL seller. Thank you!",5
"Brilliant 24 inch monitor, have owned 5 Dell Monitors before this and this one is perfect and as usual Dell doesn't disappoint, my purpose is to use it as a vertical monitor in addition to my primary and secondary 24 and 20 inch Dells so I use it mostly to read books, browse and for stock market usage and my GTX 1070 is fully capable to run all three so I am taking maximum leverage out of my setup.

Vertical monitors are a god send for browsing as you can see an entire page without much scrolling so a Landscape and Portrait monitor should be standard for everyone who is doing serious business with their PC, it's 2020 people wake up.",5
"I was looking for a monitor with adjustable height, portrait mode, and screen size enough for programming, and casual gaming. I have used Dell monitors at work, and found them of good build quality. This one fit the bill, very good build, with a sturdy and height adjustable stand. Very few monitors in this range with this thin bezels. Monitor can be rotated in portrait mode, useful during long programming / debugging sessions. Comes with 3 years Dell Advanced Exchange warranty, where they will replace the panel incase of any defect, which is awesome!

Another plus is the built in USB hub, that is immensely helpful in avoiding cable clutter. This is especially true with the Macbook with the USB-C ports. I had to just buy a USB C to A adaptor, connect it to the monitor, and have all the peripherals connected to the monitor.

I bought this from the seller KIDA Retail. The warranty has already started from Aug 2018, which the Dell support said they can change. However, the invoice Amazon provides doesn't mention the serial number and product tag. I'm working with them to get this rectified. The only other con is there is no HDMI cable included.",5
"If you're looking for a monitor for office or for general purpose work, I highly recommend this one. The colours are very rich, the stand it comes with is very high quality and it has a very thin top bezel - so gorgeous to look at. This is my first time buying a Dell monitor and i'm actually surprised it is of this quality. I'm glad I skipped the rest.

There are no inbuilt stereo speakers with this model. HDMI cable does not come with this monitor. There is a bit of backlight bleed but I'm not bothered by it. If you are that guy with that perfect standard / paranoid you made a bad purchase, you can go replace it. It's a general problem with most IPS panels. Monitor does need a bit of calibration for optimal colour accuracy. This is not the model which comes with a USB-C port. Also, the model number in title and the description in this page differs - Answered in FAQ. So hopefully you know all that before buying.

My options were originally Dell P2418 (Rs. 24,800 for 1440p on a 24'') - worried about scaling issues and Dell Ultra Sharp U2718Q (Rs. 56,000) - Very expensive. So I decided I'd just settle for Full HD as I'd be mostly using it for programming. For the price, this is a very good monitor.",5
I got this product for 13k. First one had Backlight Bleeding issue. I appreciate Amazon delivery but the second one too had the problem. As seen above right bottom is Backlight Bleeding,1
my Seller is M.V.S.N..... But Don't parcheges this Seller... because Package is not Prefect and Monitor All steckers Removed... i am parchege 22 December 2018. but Dell site saying You have August parcheges. I don't know but Monitor Working Prefect.,1
"Dell Monitors are best in the market. I had been using 1. Dell 2208WFP (almost 9 years old) and 2. Dell U2717D (few months old). I wanted to replace 2208WFP and came across this amazing monitor and awesome deal. You can't get this monitor in any stores at this price and of course I can bet on that! Apart from the price, quality is amazing. I am happy with the product. This monitor comes with 3 years of warranty from Dell.
It came with the following cables:
1. USB 3.1 upstream cable.
2. Display Cable and
3. Power Cable.
One thing everyone needs to understand is - we all buy things keeping future in mind and also thinking that the things I can do with it. For. example I would order a monitor thinking that I would play games on it but the real question is am I seriously going to play games or that's just one of the assumptions? Thought this monitor should work flawlessly on games too. It has beaten many monitors in 24 inch category heads down. The build quality is awesome too! I strongly recommend this monitor.",5
"With the onset of lockdown since March/April, 2020, I had to get monitor for mainly work from home purposes and for sure can be used for watching movies and videos. I did a lot of research, initially wanted to go for Benq 27 inch monior or Samsung curved 27 inch monitor (trending at that time), but later came to conclusion that this product of Dell is best of all for 1080p standards.

Pros:
1. If it is 1080p and if you are looking something around 13k, please avoid getting 27 inch monitor as it would NOT be good experience (trust me my friend got 27inch Benq at the same time with me); with increase in size of monitor your resolution defination should also increase. 1080p on 24 inch will be much better than on 27 inch as per my recent experiences. Also, I would recommend to avoid getting curved monitor ( had initially ordered samsung curved monitor but later cancelled it after researching more) , curved monitor will only add to value if size is more (Like atleast 34 inch) , also curved monitor has their own cons.

2. 24 inch monitor should be sufficient enough and good to go for working from home perspectives and also watching movies/videos, unless you are looking something specific.

3. Look and feel, brightness - Awesome

4. Picture quality, Accuracy - Great

5. Screen ia very good with thin bezels and matt finish, It has adjustable stand and is strong one.

6. I got it around 14.5k but definitely this is worth it than other monitors ( like benq 27 inch, samsung curved 27 inch)

7. There are different view modes, inshort if you are reading something or watching movies you can tune the mode for best experiences. Though I only use standard mode , makes most of it

Cons:
1. Didn't find any until now, will update review if I find one. Though monitor lacks audio jack/speaker, I believe that facility shouldn't be part of it or even if it is getting in other monitor they aren't of good qualities.

2. Regarding assets, I didn't get HDMI cable with this monitor, but got other two types of cable. They should support it giving HDMI cables .",5
MRP on the box is 10K beware !!,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I never expected that Whole box will be damaged and come dirty filled with mud. When I opened the box just after product got delivered and switched on tv, I found that whole monitor display was broken. I suddenly took the video of everything. But very disappointed as I was waiting eagerly for this item and received this damaged items.

Thanks Amazon for replacement option but again I need to wait for the item.",1
"Love this monitor, I am a developer and this monitor is good for development. I am using this as an external display, Works good.

---- Issues but not a problem.
- We have to rotate UI from OS for adjust in vertical display,
- Found issue with dell wireless keyboard & mouse. Usb dongle not working properly with back 2 USBs. But works fine with Wired mouse. For that I have to return my Wireless dell Keyboard & mouse. And bought Amazonbasics keyboard mouse which are also good for speed typing.",5
Excellent full HD monitor. The height is adjustable to a great extent and can be tilted backward and forward. The monitor makes possible cable management easy. It comes with two USB 2 ports and two USB 3 ports. Even the power hungry external hard disks run smoothly with all the ports. It also comes with a display port cable and USB cable. HDMI cable is not available. I used Amazon Basics HDMI cable to connect my PC to the monitor. The packing was good and all the items in the package came intact.,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 After 3 weeks of extensive effort I found this one to be the most appropriate Monitor for work. I am a full time developer, and I use this Monitor with my laptop.

Good Things:

1. Amazing Display
2. Perfect Size
3. Minimal Bezels
4. 2 x USB 3.0
5. 2 x USB 2.0
6. 1 x Display Port
7. 1 x HDMI
8. 1 x VGA
9. 1 x USB upstream

Outstanding Things:

1.Rotating Display: The display rotates on the stand, you can use it in Portrait Mode while coding or viewing logs

2. USB Hub: You can use all the USB ports on your screen as hub, you just need to plug the upstream cable from Monitor to your PC, after that all the USB ports on the monitor will work as if they were on your computer, just awesome

3. Adjustable heights: You can adjust the height by sliding the display up/down on the stand

4. Adjustable angles: You can tilt the screen forward or backward

5. You get this at around 12k

6. 5-8 ms response time

Bad Things:

Couldn't think of any so far, I mean the features you are getting at 12k INR for a 24Inch Full HD monitor you won't even find one product with such amazing offerings.

Gaming?

Games work perfectly for Beginner to Medium level players, as it is not a gaming monitor, it will be unfair to expect g-sync/free-sync and high refresh rates!

Conclusion: Just go for it....

Warning: If you are planning to buy LG Ultra gear or similar gaming monitor, please beware that those are not good for purposes other than gaming. If you are hardcore gamer, LG Ultragear is THE BUDGET MONITOR, but only for gaming.",5
I bought this Dell Monitor after my recently bought LG 24MP88HV 24 inch Monitor was accidentally broke. What I like about this Dell Model is you can freely adjust to any position you want 5 stars for that. but what i don't like is the quality of screen as compare to the previous LG monitor I had own. it doesn't mean this Dell monitor doesn't have good screen it's fabulous but my personal choice LG was a little better in terms of picture quality. Overall I am satisfied with this product.,4
"I bought this display as a secondary display connected to my Laptop. Build quality, packaging, delivery is good. but the color reproduction is Disappointing! you can see pics attached. blue comes out Green. Light blue comes out as light pink. white is yellowish white. color chart shows all colors displayed differently. Black comes out dark Gray....contrast is very poor...Rs12200 gone really waste......DELL is very disappointing. how can this be called professional series? this is not even good to see your family pics as it surprises you with different color of clothings, you never wore.... Replace window is up to 29nov 2020.

Request Amazon to replace this Monitor as all return/replace options have been removed for this product and unable to call customer care",1
"It is a good monitor for the price. Not for the games and has a noticeable lag. Not a primary monitor class, however, perfect as a secondary monitor. It struggles a bit with text antialiasing but raster images look great. However, should you require after-sale service please don't be dependent upon DELL service staff, They suck at their job, I had to buy a new monitor because they refused to provide repair (it still had many months of valid warranty left)",2
"Ordered two of them within a span of 2 weeks first one was from a seller Aapni Dukaan and second one from UniqueClick. First one was good, accurate color and all. Second one has defective panel. Yellowish tinge on all images, through all inputs (hdmi/vga) , have requested for replacement from UniqueClick, lets see how how the replacement monitor performs.
Recently the Mrp has been increased. The monitor I bought from ApniDukan was 2019 import and had price tag of about 16k, the monitor I bought from UniqueClick was 2020 import and had revised price tag of about 18k+. Its not the seller that is increasing price, its Dell who revised the Mrp. sellers are anyway selling below mrp.
Pros:
a. Wonderful Colour
b. Usb 3.0 Hub
c. Height adjustable
d. I am an IT professional, coding in this monitor is breeze. Connected with Dell Laptop as well as MacBook Pro. Dell instantly recognised and set the correct colour profile, so did MacBook Pro. It will be a breeze coding on this monitor.
e. Have connected amazon fire tv with it, works fine. Only thing is have to route the audio through bluetooth speaker
f. Colors, ( I know I am saying it again :) ) oh my god they are beautiful. I have tested with 4k videos (though monitor can reproduce only full hd) they are wonderful. Wish my phone camera could capture the vivid colors it produces

Cons:
a. An audio out Jack would be great
b. There are no hdmi or vga cable in the box. Dell doesn't provide it. They only provide one dp cable
c. Made in China. I wish it was made in India :)

PS:
I am a hobby photographer , I plan to use my set up for photoshop and da Vinci resolve color grading. For an amature this monitor will do fine.",5
"Delivered today(12 Oct), and I was happy as delivered in 48 hours. When I unpacked it found there is no label and sticker available in the product also dust on the screen, it show that it is an used screen. Further, I have connected the screen and found there is a vertical red line is appearing on right side. I have purchased a new and fresh product not an used one. I have raised an request for replacement of the product. I never expect this type of delivery from Amazon. Not happy!

13 Oct: got an replacement of the product but it is received in very bad condition, the broken screen. Hence returning the product and claimed my money back.

It is very disappointing! :(",1
"I am writing this review after almost 1 week of use and I would like to share the feedback based on my personal expectations and features based on price range.

I was madly searching about a good monitor which was supposed to serve my purposes as below:
1- Coding 50% ( As I an a developer, I do spend a lot of time in coding )
2- Video/Photo Editing 30% ( I do PHOTOGRAPHY sometimes and filmmaking too)
3- Casual gaming and other activities 20% ( I play games sometimes like Sniper elite 4 , far cry 3 and CS GO , which does not require massive GPU and refresh rates )

With Above requirements I was looking something like below specs to cater the all above purposes
IPS screen , 60-75 ghz refresh rate , 22-24 inch display, AMD freeSync(for better sync with games), 1080p resolution(for better clarity of text while coding), Good color reproduction(srGB 90%+ / NTSC 70%+), Ports(hdmi)

I did find few options like LG, ASUS, SAMSUNG but all of them had almost same specs. then I found DELL P2419H and when I compared it with all the options it stood out of all even though with slight more cost.

What I liked about this?
1- DELL being a robust LCD panel manufacturer and great after sales support.
2- Dell monitors are heavily used over corporate offices for all sort of purposes hence it has got great feedbacks and improvements over the year , so it is quite stable product
3- This model has massive positive reviews in both amazon and flipkart
4- This model has unique features like Adjustable stand , tiltable and a stand that has cable management option
5- It really has true color callibaration (not too much saturated like samsung, or not less )
6- It has 75 ghz refresh rate which is enough for my gaming purposes(not for high end games)
7- It has got nice Monitor settings and easy customized buttons for quick functions
8- Amazing brightness ( I use 20% as it has enough brightness as I work long time so I dont want to strain my eye with more brightness) But I switch to gaming,movies modes when I need to for perfect brightness setting
9- One of the best selling point of it is ports. It has 1 HDMI, 1 Display port(which nobody provides in 10-12k range), 2 usb 3,0 ports, 2 usb 2.0, 1 usb upstream port, 1 VGA. The best part is display port can be a great help for faster data display and due to its USB options u can use external mouse and key board along with pendrives or harddrives without having to be dependent with computer, as many laptops now a days have less usb ports , macs pc even do not have at all. SO it gives a great USB hub feature built in.
NOTE: to make USB ports work, please use USB upstream cable provided, and insert it to one of the usb ports in computer else usb ports in monitor won't work ( commom issues by customers)

CONS:
1- It does not have freesync where all of the models provide in this range. ( but this does not matter as this monitor is not meant for heavy gamers, for casual gamers as I mentioned names above , it does not require that sync as 75 is enough for that)

So far I am really happy with performance and look is sexy, the borders are almosr bezelless .
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR: PROGRAMMERS, VIDEO EDITORS and CASUAL GAMERS!
NO SCREEN BLEEDING ISSUE FOUND AND THESE NEW STOCKS ARE ALMOST COMING WITHOUT ISSUE OF SCREEN BLEEDING SO CHANCES ARE VERY VERY LESS.",4
"I have been using this monitor for 1.5 months now. The monitor's build is a little fragile. The panel behind the screen bends and make a sound when you try to turn the monitor. The monitor has adjustable height (can go down all the way down and can go up by about 20cm). The monitor can tilt, pivot (and go into potrait orientation) and rotate about the vertical axis about the base too (it can yaw, pitch and roll). It has a thin bezel, if that matters. I got it for Rs 14500 without any discounts.

pros:
1. Can adjust in every which way (which is why I bought it)
2. Comes with USB out ports on the sides and back
3. Good brightness

Cons:
1. It does not include a HDMI cable (had to buy that seperately), comes with a display port cable
2. The quality of the plastic behind the screen is a bit on the lower side",4
"HDMI cable was not supplied with it. Only display port cable, USB3 connector cable and power cable were there. Not all laptops have display port, so HDMI cable should be supplied with the monitor. Other than that, I have no complaints. Video is sharp. Lag is not noticeable. Colors are fine. No reflections in the screen. The main reason for using this monitor is the Stand. It can be raised or lowered and the monitor can be rotated both horizontally in either direction as well as vertically, for scrolling through large documents. Using the USB3 power cable, other USB devices (4) can be connected directly to the monitor. I am happy with the purchase.",4
"The monitor is good. But the cables given with the monitor are petty useless. The power cable is with a 16A plug. It doesn't fit into a standard power outlet. The requirement is only 1.5A. No idea why a standard 10 A cable wasn't just given. Also no HDMI cable provided.
In the end I had to use cable I already had for power and hdmi connection. If you don't, be prepared to buy them separately!",3
"Extremely happy with the purchase. Main feature that I am impressed is, it's super adjustable. we can even flip it into portrait mode which most of the monitors do not offer in this price range. Picture quality is great with antiglare protection. One of the best Monitor for WFH and for people looking for a monitor with macbook's. I am using it as an extended monitor for my Macbook pro and the screen feels so sleek.

Giving a star less as the packaging was little damaged from the outside and the monitor doesn't have an audio out and they doesn't provide a hdmi cable. My seller was ZRPL. I got it for 12.2k on amazon prime day sale",4
"I received the product on the 3rd of April 2021. My initial impressions about it were quite good. It's commendable for office work, the display is clear, the anti-glare feature is an added advantage: had no hiccups setting it up. However, it has been just 47 days using it and it's gone KAPUT. It does not power up anymore. All the precautions taken w.r.t. the electrical connection and power surges and babying the monitor and what not, the damn thing just failed within 2 months of usage. The cherry on top is that, even though it is under DELL replacement warranty, as per DELL policies my BRAND NEW MONITOR will be replaced by a ""REFURBISHED MONITOR"" only. Imagine the nightmare of receiving a refurbished replacement that may or may not be cosmetically pristine, against a BRAND NEW Product . My cheap as hell GATEWAY monitor of 12 years is still working perfectly and this piece of tech dies within months. My advice : STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM DELL.",1
"Loved the monitor.
It's a Mat 1080P Full HD monitor. The picture quality is excellent. No light bleed at all. 250 nits peak brightness.
The price is justified.
The display panel is vivid. Wonderful experience for watching videos and movies.
The major reason for me picking this monitor was the ""stand"". I am really impressed by the stand alone. Very few monitors have a stand that provides hight adjustment, along with all directional movement.
I usually prefer the monitor to be as low to tbe table as possible.
I am extremely happy with the build quality of tbe monitor as well. The stand is all metal and feels sturdy.
Happy with my purchase. I would surely recommend this.",5
"Over all Good product product, built quality can be improved looks delicate over the edges as it as narro edges. So one has to be carefull moving the monitor and adjsting the angle. AND PLEASE STOP SENDING dp port hdmi CABLE it is such a e-waste go green either don't send cable or send cable with regular hdmi port. Or give option to user to select what kind of cable to select. 90% of the time cable you send is not usefull so Reduce carbon footprint. SAVE THIS WORLD",4
"One of the best LED Monitor out there in the market
Pros:
1. Arrived in very good quality packing.
2. Simple and ease of assembling the monitor and stand. Lightweight. You will get a page of detailed instructions on assembly inside.
3. One power cable, DV cable and USB upstream cable included.
4. The monitor has high grade HD Picture quality. No flickering or any disruptions.
5. The power cable can be directly attached to the back. No extra DC convertor pack required.
6. Multiple input options such as HDMI, DV and VGA
7. 4 USB downstream ports which can be used by connecting the supplied USB Upstream cable from any USB port of your laptop/computer to the upstream port on the back of the monitor. Very convinient if you need to plug in extra USB devices.
8. Nice viewing angle. Anti Glare.
9. Can use Dell Display Manager software application to adjust the settings from Windows OS.
10. Auto detection of source connected or you can select manually.

Cons:
1. No VGA cable included in the package.
2. The adjustment switches are too small in the front, you barely feel it when you go over them.
3. No sound output since there is no speakers present in the monitor.
4. No 3.5 mm sound output connector at the back. If you are connecting an HDMI cable, there will be no option to play the sound carried by the HDMI cable. You have to connect a separate source from the sound source itself. I have selected a different source for audio from my laptop through 3.5 mm slot.
5. A bit higher on the cost side. While you can find competitor models at lower prices than this monitor.

Overall judging by the performance and quality, it is a nice addition to your workstation.",5
"+ Display is good. I connected to MacBook Air and did RDC to Windows machine too.
+ The screen can be adjusted to view it vertical- thats a great plus.
+ The ComfortView preset mode really makes it gentle on eye when working for long durations, though obviously, because it filters out blue colors, you'll miss bright colors in this setting.
- HDMI cable and Built-in audio would have made it a great package overall.",5
"Difficult to manage cables. They advertise as good for same, but not.
I wanted to buy earlier version, as also using same at office desk, but thought to go for this USB3 and newer model.
Olde model still much better!!

USB uplink powers itself down on its own.
For some reasons, when other light switches are flipped or electric door bell rings, this monitor shuts down for 3 seconds (even on power-strip/ups).

Color reproduction is okay quality. Not professional quality. The only reason it seems to call itself Professional monitor is due to [1] Stand has height adjust, [2] perhaps better after sales service options

I bought with GST transfer... however Dell refused warrantee transfer as seller did not honor the transfer (as per Dell's email reply to deny transfer).",4
I was expecting better picture quality (blacks are not at all perfect. ) screen is brighter than expected in dark scenes...which kills the enjoyment. Tried various settings in brightness and contrast but not satisfied. Even I noticed high differences in picture quality with slight change of viewing angles... not sure all IPS is like this!,3
Received damaged product. There were thick white lines in the bottom of the monitor. Damaged product was delivered.,1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Amazing experiance.. No bezzels on top and sides. Very good for professional use. 2 USB type A v3.1 ports on sides, 2 USB type A v2.x ports on back, 1 HDMI, 1 Display Port, 1 VGA port, 1 USB type B v3.1. What else you need?
Only drawback is, no 3.5mm audio jack neither input nor output, Bcoz monitor doesn't have speaker.",5
"+ rotates 90 degrees
- hard to use buttons
- difficult to navigate menu
- developed dead pixels, a huge blotch of dead pixels; right at the eye level.

Won't recommend.",1
"My existing 21"" monitor of Dell which I was using for almost 4 years went out of order hence I was looking for a new monitor. I normally use it for office purpose. I selected this particular model but I was apprehensive about the quality and since there were few negative reviews. However I still ordered for the DELL P2419H Monitor. I received the same in time and I am very happy about the product. The best thing is the extra USB Ports, even though you have to connected the monitor to the CPU with extra cable. The cable was provided in the packing. Overall a very nice product and received the product in good condition without any damage.",5
"Excellent picture quality. Good for work and watching videos
USB 3.0 port on the side is very fast and useful
Looks very nice and Easy setup.

Only problem I'm finding is the Dell's software (Dell Display Manager) to calibrate the monitor is very lean on features - Cannot tweak many parameters like saturation, Blue reduction, response time etc, instead we have to use the hardware buttons to set these parameters.",5
"Unless you‚Äôre a graphics professional of any kind, this should suffice for your uses. It‚Äôs filled with USB ports, the height adjustable stand is fantastic, and it‚Äôs build and picture quality is great for the price.

I really think the height adjustment feature is super worth it over other monitors. I‚Äôm in my late 20s and have developed back and neck muscle pains due to using fixed stand monitors for my last job. Do yourself a favour and make sure you get height adjusted for the best ergonomics. It will work out a lot cheaper in the long run and could avoid some doctor visits. This is doubly important if you spend most of your time on a computer for work like I do.",5
"Dell P2419H is an upgrade from P2417H. This monitor has decent Onscreen Display menu where you can control the inputs, brightness, contrast etc. I bought this monitor to use for programming primarily. After adjusting some of the brightness settings, it's perfect. I also played a couple of youtube videos and they looked great. So this could also be used occasionally to watch movies if you're interested.

As other reviews mention, monitor comes with a Display cable, USB hub connector and a power cord. My laptop has a display port, so didn't have to buy vga/hdmi cables for connecting purposes.

Product was delivered without any damage and arrived on time. Assembling the monitor was rather simple. It does come with a manual. But if you're a first time monitor buyer, you could look up an unboxing video on youtube and get a hang of it. The product I got was manufactured in April 2019. So I went to Dell website and initiated a warranty ownership transfer from the retailer to myself. You can verify whether it's registered on dell website with the ""service tag"" you receive with the product (it's stuck onto the package box).

Considering other models and prices, if you're looking for a monitor to work on and occasionally use it for entertainment, this is the perfect choice. The product I received didn't have any backlight bleeding issue. The flexibility of the monitor is a great plus and makes it completely worth the price.",5
"I like the monitor, it exceeded my expectations, the color constrast, wide screen, easy installation, setups, height adjustment, horizontal and vertical rotation.

Note: New 2021 model coming it with 16A plug, in India we need 10A plug (small). In any case if you received 16A plug, you Dont have to panic, please reach out your vendor on the same.

In my case, I have contacted my vendor and I told about my issue. He quickly addressed issue and told him he is going to send new cable.

I like the way the vendor addressed my issue, I am going to give thumbs up. Thanks",5
"Bought it as my second monitor for my WFH office set-up post COVID.

Though I am registered on DELL as a purchaser, selecting this monitor from the seller on Amazon was a no-brainer considering that DELL is fleecing customers by pricing the same monitor at more than double of what it is available for, here on Amazon. Kudos to the seller! (you might need to make an effort to register the product separately on DELL.com for warranty purposes.

Easy to mount, install, and works like a charm.
Definitely worth a ""CONSIDER' if not a sure 'BUY' in this category.
would definitely opt to buy one more, should there be a requirement!

PS: Monitor is primarily used for work, hence gaming capabilities are unknown to me.",4
Last time I have given a five star review about the seller @StorazeBiz.Packing is good delivery is on time as committed product is physically ok But after five days of purchase I have notice that the backlight is bleeding from the bottom and left corner of the monitor. Then I talk to amazon expert Also Add All photo of regarding color bleeding issue. He gives me a replacement. But new one is also defective. Red light color several dot appear on the monitor bottom part. It is clearly visible on the dark screen. So I want to refund my money back..,1
"I bought this recently as a convenience display for my laptop for work from home. It has what I was looking for.

Pros:
1. Slim full HD display
2. Anti-glare matte display (especially useful since in my work position, the monitor faces the window)
3. 4 USB out ports (2 on the behind, and 2 on the side): great for connecting a wired mouse, keyboard, and any other devices. Contrary to other reviews, I had no issues in using the side USB out ports. This does away with the need for an USB hub.
4. Thin bezel around the display
5. Comes with a stand that is easy to setup, and has an adjustable height. Also, the monitor can be swiveled to an angle of about 10 degrees upwards.

Cons:
1. Does not come with an HDMI cable that can connect to a standard laptop. So, if buying this, order one if you don't have a spare one around.
2. Expect plenty of more messiness with wires all around. I had to spend some time rearranging all the cables and wires to get them out of my work space.
3. The back side connections are a bit difficult to access. A piece of advice is that you fix the cables on the monitor back before mounting it on the stand.",4
"The best monitor for professionals and gamers. I am a CAD engineer and graphic artist both and this monitor is best for me.
Dell's software, Dell Display Manager, makes it quite convenient to arrange different windows on the screen with various arrangement patterns available.
The USB ports driven by a USB upstream cable makes this monitor a USB docking station as well. You can attach 4 USB devices to it. it makes it very convenient, you don't have to plugin/out 4devices everytime, but just one upstream cable.
The adjustable VESA mounting stand with proper gromet hole for all cables is just perfect!

The only thing I miss here is- this monitor must have had a 3.5mm audio output port.

Built quality is really premium, heavy and sturdy. Makes it a really premium, professional equipment.

Overall, It is a complete monitor with built in docking device, 4 star because if doesn't have a audio output, else its a 5 star device.",4
"After a lot of research I bought this. But one thing I did not like is th calibration done. I connected to my Lenovo P52 and colors were dull intially. After exploring I found that, we have to adjust nvidea the graphics card settings. Put RGB output to full. You will get correct colors. I'm satisfied with this. Only missing headphone jack bothers me.",4
"Disappointed with the color accuracy and reproduction. Had bought two monitors for my office. While one was woefully subpar, it atleast wasn't defective ( edit ; I was able to get good results after setting up a color profile that my Samsung S24R35x came with, and after fiddling with the monitor settings ). The other one is just plain crappy! The deepest red you can manage is a deep neon orange ! Tried tons of calibrations and adjustments, different color profiles, but the panel seems to be old and defective. Too brown from side angles and unappealing, inconsistent brightness and color quality even at 0deg viewing angle. I'm returning the defective one ! And making a new order from a different seller. It's unfortunate that QC is a lost concept among manufacturers these days, because then I wouldn't have to give such a bad review for a great monitor that I 've come to love over the last few years.",2
"Monitor looks good. Stand is height adjustable and easy setup. Picture quality is same as basic monitors, no noticeable difference.

County of origin was mentioned as Singapore but product I received says made in China.

First I had received a faulty monitor, brightness was not uniform and text had shadow. Had to make multiple calls to Amazon and Dell. Finally, Amazon arranged for a replacement.",4
"I have bought this after so much research, I have finally settled on DELL, because of the brand. But after buying I regret it now.

The picture quality is blurry, not crisp. I have been using the Samsung monitor for 10 years with no issues in picture quality. Bought an Acer monitor yesterday, no issues.

I think the monitors should be checked for quality in-person, before buying",2
"Colors on this monitor are Ok but looks little washed out. It's only suited for work like coding and web browsing(weird blurry effect if scrolled quickly through web page). Peak brightness is also on the weaker side. Not good in brightly lit room.
For movies and casual gaming it's not good. No speakers no audio out port.
Even though it's a 60Hz monitor 60fps gaming is not possible even with the not so graphics intensive games.
The only good thing which I think is the adjustment options. Height, tilt, pivot, swivel.
I'm returning it as it does not fulfill my requirements and I'm kind of disappointed. Will look for other options on Amazon.",3
"cause severe eye strain and headaches

i tried for 10 days than passed on to an employee in office she even experienced the same eye strain

the monitor quality / look and feel is very good

but the GALRE makes the experience a nightmare

may be there might be some issue with the monitor i received.

tried calling helplines but it doesnt accept my product code and the call is not forwarded to any human to talk with

only a pre-recorded software the CLIENT IS LEFT TO INTERACT with

PATHETIC responce by DELL on email too. ask me to call on toll free number already mentioned on websites

DONT BUT PRODUCT from such companies who cannot heir customer care representatives too... spent 15000 for the monitor and got such experience",1
"I'm so sad, Dead black pixel 15cm from left and 1cm from bottom is clearly spotted on the day of delivery itself. Requested for replacement.

No VGA/ HDMI cables included, packing was okay just bubble sheet over the dell package.",1
"It's expensive compared to other monitors in this price range, also its just FullHD, but that's how much I am ever going to use for Reading and Writing in 24inch screen.

I love the height, angle and rotation adjustments it offers. also the edges are bezel less. Impressive.

For the the price its the best Dell professional monitor I could find for Development. Love It!!",5
"This came with a 16A power cord, while all other 24 inches monitors come with a normal power cord. This makes this un-usable in a normal scenario. DO NOT ORDER as they will not replace the product or the power cord. I ordered three 24 inches monitors, one from Dell, the other two from LG and HP. Only Dell has this issue.",1
Why does dell provide this huge 15A power connector ? I can‚Äôt connect it to any of my power outlets . This is not something like an air conditioner which needs this kind of plug and I can‚Äôt connect it even to my UPS outlets,1
"Hello Guys,

I was looking for a 24"" monitor for programming and browsing. This monitor is just perfect for this task.
Few quality of this monitor are :
1. Best monitor stand : If you are looking for development for stand is must so that you can adjust it in any direction {vertical & horizontal ] as per the need.
2. Anti-glare screen : Screen quality is super , it is just best of coding and browsing . I have not tried watching full hd movies but checked few videos on YouTube and they were fine.

Monitor is just awesome . I am complete happy with the product.
If you are looking for coding and work purpose. This monitor is just the best. Don't think too much just order, its really good.

Thanks to amazon too for great customer service.",5
"I searched and reviewed monitors for months before deciding for my home office. I am so happy that I picked this Dell to go with. I wanted a monitor with display ports, nice quality screen, mountable, and didn't take up a ton of desk space. I was hesitant to get the 24 inches, but Its more than enough!These monitors are perfect for working with excel spreadsheets. I also watch videos on it and the quality seems good.
Highly recommend getting this!",5
"3 Months into lock down and working from home, meant it was high time I needed an extra monitor with my laptop. Needed something basic for work; but realized that for little extra, one can get some important features that go long way for future use of the monitor. Surveyed top monitors, and zeroed in on this one -
Pros:
- Thin bezel look
- Tilt, swivel and height adjustable easily - with real sturdy base
- Dell warranty and after sales service presence
- Nice connectivity built-in - with extra Downstream USB ports built in
- low power consumption (18 W) - hardly noticed any heat !
- ships with USB cable for upstream USB connection to Monitor

Cons:
- Does not ship with either HDMI/VGA/Thunderbolt 3/mini Displayport cables, only standard Display port cable is included.
- Response times are 8 ms / 5 ms - on the slower side; some ghosting observed when watching fast moving action; but this is expected
- no built in speakers - again, you can always connect better speakers yourself.

I ordered mine from StorazeBiz seller; delivery was before time, even with rains/Covid 19 lock down. Packaging was good. My query reg. warranty/registration was promptly answered. So overall, nice experience so far. Hope to use for years to come.",5
This is how I received the product,1
"Overall good product

The pixel density is not great. So image quality will not be to the fullest.
Very easy in adjusting the height and tilt with one hand. But it's a must to use both hands for swivel (rotating the screen on its base). Felt it was a bit heavier than expected, though it didn't pose any problem. USB hub works just fine.

I'm greatly satisfied with the product. I've been using it for programming, browsing and occasional movies.",5
"Monitor Work Fine as expected and Dell Monitor always deliver excellent service .

But I want to say that , the product is incomplete. The HDMI to HDMI cable is missing. They have sent Display port to Display port cable which has no issue at all.

I have purchased this product for my laptop and Lenovo laptop doesn't have display port in it.

Seller should send all thee types of cable.

If you are buying such expensive product and then again you have to buy HDMI to HDMI cable is not expected. Very Very poor customer service and good for nothing",5
"Note: This is not fault of amazon. This review is against DELL. Monitor is legit and awesome everything is good.
But.
Dell after sell service is soooo bad. Warranty despite being 3yrs. Dell doesn't replace/repair panels if broken. Instead they ask to buy new one.

Accidents happen. I am not going for Dell anymore.",1
"1. Stand - for adjusting and tilt
2. Monitor clarity
3. Download the software from dell website so that you can operate the monitor from the PC.
4. HDMI cable needs to be bought separately
5. Go to Dell website and check warranty - it comes with 3 year warranty",5
"Original product. Good packaging. Easy installation. Provided with DP cable only. Cable lengths appropriate. Height adjustable makes it flexible to use. Satisfied after using this product for 3 months. Only issue observed not related to product but with virtual desktop access during office work. If you invoke virtual machine on the montior screen and then shift back to laptop, doesn't fit correct. We will have to re- lauch the application with resolution to fit correct on laptop screen. But I feel it's totally the application issue. But just a heads up for users.",5
"The monitor has multiple features which make it an outstanding one:
- Adjustable height and option to adjust inside out
- Fullscreen monitor
- Multiple options to connect (HDMI, DP, VGA, etc)
- Additional option to add USB
- Dell does not provide HDMI cable inside the box!

Negatives- Price is slightly high, it should have been in the range of 10K to 11K. I got it for 13K !",4
"This is a fabulous monitor!

If you are a digital marketer or data analyst, this is 'the' monitor for you.

The display is crystal clear and the wide monitor makes data analysis so easy.

Now creating dashboards in Google Analytics or Data Studio is fun (It was difficult to do these tasks (for long hours) using a small laptop display)

The display is crisp and the colours are vibrant. So if you do graphic designing, this monitor will be an asset to you.

The monitor stand is just incredible. All the adjustments it provides (height, swivel, pivot and angle) adds much more flexibility in to the work flow.

This is a great piece of tech that will increase your productivity and make your work more fun.

Highly recommended. Buy it.",5

Easy Installation and design is flawless and elegant.",5
"This is best desktop for professional work and coding. Since it's adjustability in height and rotation
you can adjust it for various usecase like you can make it vertical for coding without need to buy new stand.
Since it has IPS panel it is good to view from any side.

For Gamers
Well these thing depend on your gpu no matter how much high end you desktop specs if you don't have gpu then it's waste
So if you have gpu like lower than 1050 then buy these if you have higher then go for higher price range desktop in lg and acer

if you are Gamer and coder then buy these
Because believe me able to adjust these desktop without buying clamp stand is best and very convenient and it's not that bad for gaming",5
"We should be aware that we get the product for the price that we give.
Here if you have a MacbookPro laptop which has best display and add this monitor to it, you will understand the difference in quality.
I got this monitor for 13.5K, spent another 1.5K for Usb C to HDMI adapter and HDMI cable.
You wont get HDMI or VGA cable with this monitor.

Poor picture quality, I'm thinking why did I even buy this product. I should have to spent 5K more and should have purchased U2419H model.

Now there is no return policy in Amazon.",2

"Hi,
I purchased Dell 24P19H black monitor in November 2020. After working good for around 6 months - suddenly I started to see vertical and horizontal lines and a black spot on top of screen when I powered it ON on a morning. Now when I contacted Dell Support team then they asked me to click pictures of screen in diagnostic mode and send so that they proceed with product replacement. But to my shock, after sending pictures they refused to replace quoting reason that your screen is damaged and Dell won't replace it. I attached picture with review of same monitor. Do you notice any physical damage on it ? Yes offcourse when we power it on - we will notice a blackish spot on top but if a black spot means physical damage then I must say that they are making very delicate products and of very bad quality.

NOT RECOMMENDED BECAUSE OF VERY VERY BAD AFTER SALE SUPPORT !!!",1
"If you are looking for an all round performance this is something you should definitely consider, there are not a lot of products specially at this price point which offer you the kind of versatility like this one

Pros:
1. Great looks with minimal bezels.
2. options to move the screen around until you find the best possible set up for yourself, Up, Down, Landscape, Potrait, Tilt, stem movement without moving the base.
3. Very easy to set it up
4. Perfect Size for both office and personal use

Cons:
1. Did not come with a HDMI Cable, really couldn't believe",5
"Monitor is good so far. Its from Dell so no ckmplaint in quality, delivery

I have only one suggestion to Dell. The power cable provided with this monitor comes with 16amp plug. Why is that required. For such plug we need a high load socket usually not available in quick vicinity of computer.

I purchased a local monitor cable worth Rs 100 with general 5amp plug and it is working fine.
Dell giving 16amp plug is an overkill please replace it with normal power cable

I have reduced 1 star for the inconvenience caused by the 16amp cable",4
"Excellent monitor for professional use. I have connected it to my HP elitebook which has a tiny screen and man! What a difference. I literally asked myself why I didn‚Äôt purchase this monitor earlier. Colours are nice and sharp, text is sharp and viewing angles are really good. It also has tons of direction changing options. Without a second thought anyone who wants a solid built to last and sleek looking monitor can purchase this. It came really well packed too. The box comes with all the major cables except the hdmi one. You can use the existing DP cable if you have an older port on your computer. Overall great monitor for my work from home use. I use it for my kid‚Äôs school too and he is more engaged now.",5
"If i could I would buy 3

Compared to my old Samsung Monitor around same price, Dell has really delivered a good product.

+ Resolution and Picture Quality
+ Brightness
+ Color Vibrance
+ Additional ports for better cable optimization
+ Height and Angle adjustable stand (Much required feature that i never realised was that important)
+ It looks awesome

Cons:
- None that i could think of

Value for money purchase",5
"Got this monitor to allow my wife, a radiologist to do medical reporting from home on her laptop. For complex CT and MRI scan images one needs a large anti-glare monitor with high resolution. This one has all of it. In addition, the monitor comes with choice of display ports (HDMI, DP..). It has 2 USB ports on side conveniently placed to allow and power any external devices. Picture quality is great and she is happy with the product.",5
"The monitor by itself seems to be a good and fine quality.

But I had these following issues:

1. The internal packaging was damaged when I had received. Bought it through the seller - ecomputerstore.
2. While moving the monitor around, I could hear the sound of loose screws moving inside.
3. Contrary to what many suggested, the monitor is a big NO as an external display for MacBook Pro (I checked with 2019 16-inch). The fonts look pixelated. I understand that one cannot expect retina level display, but the same monitor while connecting to a Windows laptop does a better job of rendering the fonts.",2
"Good monitor below 14k. Screen bleed issue is there which seems normal for ips panels.
The product I received from seller ecomputerstore is already registered and I am not sure how to avail warranty. So not sure whether its a cheat or a deal. Price mentioned on Dell box is 13k.",3
"Brought this for working from home. The display, design are good. The portrait tilt feature is awesome.

One difficulty I face and still face is that, I need to change the brightness in morning and lower it during night use. There is no shortcut to store our custom brightness which is kind of pain to do it everyday.

Apart from this there isn't any other issues which I faced.",5
"I bought this monitor last month..I am facing very strange issue. Once I connect this monitor to my MacBook through HDMI cable, electric current is flowing, which causing electric shock/tingling in my laptop. Initially I thought, it is a MAcBook issue but when I checked HDMI cable, I found electric current is flowing though HDMI cable which is connected to monitor...I made a replacement request thinking the issue is with the product that I have ordered. But the product that I got after replacement has the same issue. And Amazon Customer care is not helping to answer ""The above explained issue persist with the product that I got or it persists with all the product of this model? "" If later is true, they should mentioned somewhere in product description.",3
"Nice Screen.. Worked ion this around 8 years ago and always wanted to buy one. now gonna buy one more. movies are clear and almost all games are good on the screen.
Light Weight but strong built. Only backdrop is that it does not come with a HDMI or VGA cable.
Display Cable and Power cable are included along with USB Hub cable.
Over all Good Value for money.",5
"I'm a marketer and I'm looking for a 1920*1080 resolution monitor landed up in two models HP E243 and Dell 2419. Though HP is sleek and sexy I had to buy this one as it has a USB Hub. HP has only HDMI output.

Overall picture quality and website and templates are rightly viewed.",5
"Awesome monitor for work and consuming media. Perfect screen size. Excellent build quality. Has height adjust, tilt adjust and swivel adjust. Sharp image (24 inch perfect for 1080p monitor).

Comes with display port cable (no hdmi cable)
Also comes with type B usb pass-through cable for connecting keyboard and mouse to monitor.",5
"Monitor doesnt start when there is a power fluctuation, we need to manually unplug the cable and then plug again to get the monitor working....this is really a big mess considering we are busy in webex calls and screen sharing etc...DELL disappoints...",3
"Dell Makes really good monitor at all price points. The build quality is good. Bought it for work from home set up because of prolonged work from home due to coronavirus. It has adjustable height option to others at home can adjust based on the their height. Overall good monitor. It has 2 usb ports, one HDMI , one vga and one display port. No audio out though.",5
"One of the best monitors. The resolution is perfect and the bezel less helps.

Bonus is height adjustment and tilt.",5
"Picture quality very nice. Matt finish screen. Very premium look with combination of black and silver.
Package comes with power cable, display port cable, usb upstream cable (using this u can use monitor USB ports). U need buy HDMI cable separatly ( i will recommend belkin it cost around 500/- don't compromize on hdmi cable because this is the only medium of your monitor and laptop).
I will recommend buy it from ZRPL seller. Brand new monitors from zrpl, i did lot of reasearch so suggesting them. I know there r lot of sellers for this monitors and people get confuse from where to buy. I got this in 12,999/- from zrpl.
Rest monitor review u can see on youtube, 24"" is perfect for work from home.",5
I use this for my daily job for programming. It has enough width to see my full lines of code in my IDE. Not sure about gaming though. Its easy on the eyes. Sturdy stand with enough height adjustable and tilt. Can also make it vertical which is excellent for debugging logs. Highly recommended for programmers.,5
"Monitor is perfect choice for workstation and text is very sharp and clear.24 inch monitor is ideal choice incase your desk setup is of medium size.bezels are very thin and looks sleek and minimalistic.

HDMI cable is not included we need to buy separate one .
It is okay to play games but this monitor is not gaming monitor with high refresh rate. I played with my ps4 experience is good.
Monitor stand can be tilted and adjustable for height which makes setup easier and convenient to use.
Only one hdmi port is there and 4 usb ports and and a VGA port .ports should have been placed in reachable position as it is harder reach and connect cables.there are two usb ports on left side which are easier to reach.
Monitor stand Base is sturdy and firm.

I would recommend this for professionals only with occasional gaming.",5
"This monitor had everything I wanted, but I had to return it due to a problem with uneven brightness. There was fading towards the edges and this resulted in eye strain. I don't know whether this was limited to the product I received or if it is the case with the model itself. Given that no one else has complained about it, I assume it is the former. Hence keeping 4 stars.

Pros:
1. Has all sorts of ports (HDMI, DP, VGA) and multiple USB slots.
2. Screen can be rotated 90 degrees, has vertical and horizontal swivel and has height adjustment
3. Great colour reproduction.

Cons:
1. Any white background led to excessive brightness and the fading towards the edges resulted in eye strain. Unfortunately most of office work involves white screens, making text feel blurry.",4
"This is a great monitor. I absolutely love it. The picture quality is great. The stand is brilliant. The inbuilt USB hub is a great plus. They should have given one more HDMI port instead of a VGA port, but apart from that, everything is fine for productivity and watching shows and movies. Not meant for gaming. It is only 60Hz.",5
"This is a fake product. You clearly see puxels and its not even hd screen. It gives ete strain just after using for 30 minutes. Text is not clear and you cannot work on word and Excel.
Amazon wont accept return.",1
"The product came with Power Plug i.e. 15A socket and Dell says that there were issues with power fluctuations and that's why they have put 15A socket. It was not mentioned on Amazon Site or Dell Site that 15A socket is needed. Amazon declines to return as I want refund as I do not have that socket in my home (except bathrooms and kitchen).
Very bad behaviour from amazon as well as the specification was not listed and they decline to refund. Very Bad experience.",1
"Reviewing after exactly one year of everyday usage. No complains whatsoever. Easily adjustable both vertically and horizontally. No connectivity issues. Display good as new even today. Adequate display settings available to adjust the colors, contrast and brightness.",5
"This is the second time I'm ordering this piece. I returned the first one when the left side (1/4th of the screen) has different tint than the right side, and looks like the 2nd also suffers from the same problem.
Seems like the anti glare coating is not uniform.

Has backlight bleeding for the bottom right corner, which can be noticed even with good lighting.

If you ask that why I went with the same model again, then I would say that only alternative in this segment was Benq GW2480, and I was skeptical about Benq's post sales service so I didn't go for it.

I am not able post pictures as camera automatically focuses more on the center so I can't capture the brightness difference properly.

I am going to keep it as I am tired of return/replacement.

If people have better budget then I request them to go with WXGA or 2K resolution monitors...",2
"Purchased this monitor for wfh and coding.
But face no issues while playing GOW on PS4.
Only down side is that it does not have a speaker.
Also there is not 3.5mm jack to attach external speaker.

The brightness has a good range and works well for a person with dry eyes syndrome.

If you don't need to attach a speaker to it.. then go for it.",5
"The color quality is good, you get HDMI cable, Had to use connector for MacBook , Height adjustable and angle adjustable also you can use it with external arm.
Overall a good product, Have two as of now. Purchased another during start of CoVID.

I used to get same screen when I used to Work for Amazon BLR, So WFH setup is similar",5
"Value for money . The only thing missing in this Monitor is the inbuilt speaker . The colours are crisp . Viewing angles at its best . Easily the best monitor available at this price range . I had a look at other competitive brands before zeroing in this one . Go for it with your eyes closed . Easy to assemble , comes with instructions and we get warranty for this . Worth every penny",4
"Overall a good product in this price range.

I earlier thought that this monitor comes with USB 3.1 slot and a cable, which can be used with my mac. But thats not true - USB cable support is to enable USB ports available in monitor only. - It cant be used to transmit display.

My mac does not has display port, so the display cable provided with this was of no use. I had to order a HDMI cable and a connector to be able to use this monitor.

I wish monitor comes with HDMI cable in place of Display cable.",5
"Perfect For Professional Work. Looks wise, it wins heart at first sight. Performance is extraordinary. Bezz are thin. Tried playing a full HD /4K video result? Perfect! If you are looking under 15k Monitor go cart it. This will cover your professional work as well as entertain you on your weekends. FINALLY ITS DELL AND YOU KNOW IT BETTER.",5
I already had two Dell monitors but I soon realized the adjustable stand for height and rotation was something I needed. This is the most under rated feature helps in analyzing code and logs. Bought two these bad boys for INR 14k each. I'm OK with the 1080p resolution and the brightness is very workable for my work - although I always use the Night Light settings of Windows 10 given my long working hours in-front of the screen.,5
"This is the best! I was pretty skeptical before buying this at the price of rs.13,900 but it is a bang for the buck!
Read till the end for a helpful & important tip if you are gonna use HDMI cable for connecting this monitor

Pros:
The picture quality is truly awesome!
The monitor stand is very sturdy and premium
Their is almost all possible adjustments for the stand - tilt, height, swivel, pivot
There is almost no backlight bleed
More than enough brightness for clear visibility
Minimum ghosting
Good response time
24inch panel is more than enough for me!
Budget friendly
High Quality premium feel!! Truly this monitor looks and feels premium

Cons:
Only 60Hz refresh rate (though I am not a gamer!)

GREAT TIP: If u are gonna use HDMI to connect this monitor to PC having NVIDIA GPU
Go to Nvidia Control Panel software
Navigate to Display>Change Resolution
Then scroll down and select ""Use Nvidia color settings""
SET ""Output color format""= RGB , ""Output Dynamic Range""=Full then APPLY
and you will notice a hell and heaven difference! Thank me later friend!!

I'm really very very impressed with the monitor!!!",5
"I bought this monitor in August of 2019, and have used it every day since. The first one that I had delivered worked well with no issues for the first two days and then presented me with a line of dead pixels from top to bottom on a portion of the screen. I requested for a replacement, which came in 2 days and that one has not given me problems.

I use it as an extension to a 2018 Macbook Pro. The screen causes minimal stress on the eyes even over long periods of use. It has all the adjustments that one would need.

As for inputs, it has HDMI and DisplayPort. A DisplayPort cable is included in the box with the monitor although I'd have preferred an HDMI one.

Picture quality is excellent and is a pleasure to look at from short distances.

All in all, a great monitor and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get one.",5
"The best quality you can in this price range. Very low power consumption, multiple connection options, and excellent screen quality. I am using it for work and occasional movies watching.

Cons:
1) Doesn't comes with HDMI cable
2) USB hub will not directly work, you have to connect provided cable with the USB port of your laptop (along with HDMI; total two cables).",5
"What can I say, I love it!
Its full HD - Check
Thin Bezel - Check
Extra USB - Check
Vesa Mount - Check
Display Port - Check
Height adjustment - Check
Angle Adjustment - Check
Frecking 180 degrees rotation (heaven for coders)
Ideal for daily tasks, productivity, multimedia, and yes coding and some light gaming (don't expect much as it 5ms response time",4
"Excellent quality of picture with rotation, tilting & height adjustment facility. It has two USB ports left side of the monitor. The cable to activate the monitor USB ports are provided.
It came with power cable, & two other connecting cables.
I purchased it for Rs. 14,700/- Amazon. Very fast delivery.",5
"Best monitor for professional use. Best screen quality, anti-glare and IPS panel which describes it all, Not for gaming as response is not 1ms. But it doesn't mean that you can't play games at all. If you play light games then it's also a good choice but the best use is for professional work. Hight and angle adjustment is good and build quality is superb as yoi can expect it from DELL. Also the reason I bought this is USB plugs which you don't see usually in other monitors at this price point. If you use mac then you need to have USB ports for external keyboard and mouse and this monitor satisfies that.",5
"Delivery was prompt and packing was intact. Display monitor has power, USB(upstream) and DisplayPort (PS: NOT HDMI) cables included.
If you are using monitor with Mac having USB-C port, then USB Type C Male to DisplayPort Female adapter is necessary. I realised it after receiving monitor and ordered separately. (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07F34HBST/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
Monitor has support for HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA inputs and if you have compatible cable for any one of these inputs then adapter is not necessary.
Overall very happy with monitor and it serves my purpose of office and programming use. Dell P2419H is just right size for browsing and coding usage.",5
"Pros: Very good quality. Soft on eyes, flexible rotating options.. . and finally, very easy installation...

Cons: connectors provided cannot be used, for most of the users.
Most computers dont have display port, but have hdmi ports... So, adding hdmi cable would help most consumers avoid buying it additionally.

usb video cable is provided, but usb data cable is not provided... Have to buy data cable, to really get it working.",4
"This monitor was good for my purposes, but unfortunately, it got some issues and stopped working. I went to dell service centre and now they were asking the invoice with monitor serial/g-tag number. I‚Äôm still struggling to get a new invoice with these details from amazon customer care. So, attention all the purchasers, u need to have these details in the invoice, otherwise they will not service this monitor with in warranty period.",4
"The Dell monitor is a great looking piece of hardware with minimal bezels and fantastic performance. Would definitely recommend buying it if you're replacing an older monitor like I did. It doesn't have the deepest blacks, but the color is vibrant and good contrast numbers which make it great for gaming.",5
"I liked the quality and ease of setup and the stand is very great and useful. the way the monitor can easily rotate on the stand is great, so u can use portrait mode too , no issues. but no audio, i wish it had some speakers built in. and also, there is only one hdmi port, not two. the other one seems a display port. no cables either, neither vga, nor hdmi.",4
Everything is great about this Monitor for the price. Of course there is a higher model of it with USB-C connectivity which is brilliant but is lot to pay for that feature. I‚Äôm not sure about gaming as I don‚Äôt use it for that but overall WFH and split screen utility works fantastic!,5
The display is absolutely magnificent. It has a sleek design with thin bezels and a matte black stealth look. The feature which I found most useful was it's portrait mode and height adjustability. Now I can even read books and view other content on my computer. This feature is present almost exclusively in Dell Monitors of this range.,5
"I have purchased this in June-2019 for INR 13,398/-, so far it's going well. The only, inconvenience I have faced is with plugging & unplugging the cables as the port are a bit hidden behind. Now, I would suggest going for 4K if the budget permits. The seller is KIDA Retail Private Ltd.",3
"Product delivered , seems to be used one as there were no protective plastic cover on screen and it was not packed neatly. Also, one of the four USB drive is not working. Everything else works fine. I am not returning it as I am in dire need of it and can‚Äôt wait for another week to get replacement.",4
Faulty Monitor . It did not even turn on,1
"Got this delivered last week , Thursday . Will categorise my experience on delivery and actual product review ,

Delivery experience :

My scheduled delivery date got changed without any prior notice . However I don't not have much complaint with that given the lockdown situation , I understand that shipping and delivery can take time . The product came in a nice double packaging . One the monitor came in and other Amazon box . It was so well packed that there was no way of any damages.

Product quality :

The monitor is bright enough . Best thing is the display is very soothing to look at . I generally have to sit infront of my laptop screen almose the entire day due to my work the monitor actually reduce the pressure on my eye . Hdmi cable was not included so had to order one separately .best buy.",5
"I purchased it a couple of months ago and I waited before writing this review. It's really really good for the price. I'm a software developer and for people like myself, it's a boon since it can swivel 90 degrees and go to portrait mode which is the best for coding.",5
"After lots of reviews, finally decided to go with P series Dell 2419H.
My other choices - Samsung and LG 24"".
But I'm not too inclined as I'm not a big gamer.
Its for regular WFH purpose with very minimal multimedia purpose.
And so decided to go with Dell, as it has swivel option and relatively reliable for WFH.
Due to lockdown the prices had been inflated off late.
But since for WFH, needed this, so bought this for 14k.",4
"Its an awesome display. If you pay for diamond, you get diamond. If you pay for peanuts you get monkeys. Its an investment though its costly. It encourages you to be productive since you spent 15k on monitor. :)

Picture quality is just fabulous, display is sleek!! Loved the purchase.",5
Very good monitor. Got this as second monitor. Have a benq which is not flexible in terms of height adjustment and rotation. Using this in portrait mode with mac Pro as dual monitor setup. Nice so far.,5
"Watching HD quality videos on youtube made me realize what I was missing the monitor is borderless and gives the impression of immersiveness.
Worth buying this. I don't do much gaming but they worked fine. I sit in front of this monitor 14 hours a day so it is not glaring and have made some customization to the color settings of the screen.",5
"Beautiful monitor. Does what's advertised. Easy to install. Looks very elegant. Colours are very accurate.
I purchased it for trading. Now it sits on my desk beautifully and displays those charts in details!

Highly recommend this to everyone. Worth the money! üëå",5
"Very nice Matt finish display ..easy to adjust height and even rotation to vertical for reading document in portrait mode.

Comes with usb and display port cable....my laptop does not had display port so need to buy hdmi..

All in all perfect 24 inch monitor",4
"Very nice monitor, no bleeding lights. Best monitor for long work hours.

Special thanks to seller @ZRPL, received completed sealed and untampered.

Although amazon packaging could improve, still its good.",5
"This product is good in general, but if you are a user who is accustomed to high pixel density display, then you will not like the display you get here.
I have raised a return request. The pickup person arrived on the pickup day, and told me he is carrying 2 pickup receipts and will not be able to accept the item unless he scans two barcodes for the two items to be picked. I was surprised, as I was returning only one item. He suggested to cancel the return request and raise another one. Following this I spoke with a customer care agent, who said he has raise another return request, and the previous problem could be a technical issue. Such glitches are not expected from a technically strong company like Amazon.",2
"I purchased this monitor to add a secondary screen to my Macbook Air as its screen size is only 13 inch.
But I was very lucky as I choose this as trust me this is the best monitor you could have in this price range.
Picture quality is beyond my expectations. I strongly recommend this to those who want to use monitor in the portrait mode by rotating it 90 degree.
Other good feature is its anti glare screen which wil really help you while using it for long hours.

Overall I should say buy it without any hesitation. This is going to be your best companion.",5
"Good product. Excellent screen view. Its almost like double to triple of my laptop screen, where i can see texts and videos 8n big screen. Really an aweful product.Can connect usb type accessories as it has 2 upstream and 2 downstream usb slots. There is no hdmi to hdmi cable provided, i bought outside only.Hdmi cable could have been added.Its single cons i see for this price.",5
"I am using this for programming purpose. main thing is this display doesnot having any VGA and HDMI cable, i have to bought it from shop. so please provide cable with this.",4
Best monitor you can buy for the money. Refresh rate is capped at 60hz but overall picture quality and viewing angles are best in segment. Stand is also very strong and sturdy does not wobble like other budget monitors and allows movement in all directions also allows height adjustment.,5
"Very good quality display. Easy to setup. The stand is excellent, it allows display to set virtually in any direction. Tilt, rotate, pivot rotate and height adjustment is great flexibility",5
"I dislike all the things about this monitor. The picture quality is very bad.. As seen, in images most of the times even after connecting it to the hdmi source the display is full of nasty and annoying dirtly lines.. May be the hot plus detection is very poor.. Sometimes the screen is blurry even when monitor is poweres off and on.. Very poor quality.. Not at all worth for the price I am paying.. Screen also flickers and it so irritating to work on this as eyes are strained too much. Also sometimes the edges are also fading and not sharp. Also when I poweron the monitor without any video input, whole screen is white and solwely entire screen gets corrupted as in the attached images..",1
I am using this while working from home. The display size is perfect - not too big not too small. The height adjustment has enabled me to raise the display so that I can place it right behind my laptop and so am able to see both displays without turning my head. The best feature is the USB hub that has extended the 2 USB ports of my laptop to five apart from reducing the number of cables that connect to my laptop. All in all it is a great buy.,5
I really like this monitor... Previous I was using a 20inch Samsung monitor (1600x900 resolution) which had 92dpi. That's why I bought this monitor (It also has same dpi) instead of 22inch dell monitor. Pictures quality is very nice. Also the usb ports are very useful. Only drawback is it doesn't have any audio output... Other than that üëçÔ∏è,5
"I am using this monitor from couple of days. I am a happy customer. Thanks to Dell and Amazon.
I am giving 4 start rating but not 5 because I haven't got hdmi cable to connect with my mac laptop. Instead i got Display port cable which is of no use for me.

So I was supposed to pay little more to purchase hdmi cable.",4
Overall its a perfect monitor with very good picture quality and vibrant colors. The unique features about this monitor are the flexible stand and the extra usb ports provided for connectivity which comes to handyy when connected with Macbook or a laptop. The only downside I have noticed is the missing port for Audio connectivity.,4
"Nice LED display. It has some features that really captivated me such as adjustable height, rotation landscape or portrait. It comes with 3 years warranty that makes you feel safe for any future issues. Nice build quality. Make sure after purchasing, you register at the dell website for the warranty. I don't use it for gaming that why I didn't rate it for gaming. I use it for programming and watch videos, and it works awesome for that.",5
"Antiglare is awesome, picture clarity - I am able to see pixels and doesn't feel like IPS panel- may be due to big screen size.

Height adjustment and tiltabilitty is a win.

Mrp on box is :11671 , mrp listed on website is 20k.
I got this monitor at a great discount price of 12.8k.

What a cheating",5
i received damaged product. In the middle of the led panel there's a small red dot. It is only seen when the moniter is on balck or dark colors. I think this is a dead pixel. I am very unhappy with this purchase. I am going to repalace moniter.,2
"I brought Samsung Monitor with 50% of more cost compare to Dell monitor. Samsung stopped working exactly 12 days after delivery. Finally returned and brought Dell which is best in every aspect. have 6 USB ports, DP, HDMI, DVI options. Product built quality also good.",4
"Excellent as expected. I'm very old computer user and I'm really happy after seeing this product.
No damages or scratches while shipping. Good packing.
No backlight bleeding. ( 1080p ips display)
Highly height, angle and rotation adjustable.
4 usb ports ( 2 usb 3.0 on left side )
Chosen this monitor after lot of comparisons, reviews and the risks
Bought for Rs 13,990. Compared to other 24 inch monitor, this is little expensive because of the quality and brand value.
I'm sure this monitor will run for 10 years :)
I promise you love this if you have budget of 14000 .",5
"Amazing product for the price range

Good :
1. Has USB ports which can be used as extra ports. Note you will have to connect one USB cable for that which is provided in the box
2. Perfect size
3. Base is slim
4. Perfect if you want to rotate it. Horizontal and vertical possible. Also up down motion possible

Bad (can be neglected if you are not too picky)
1. Plastic not metal
2. Normal hdmi cable not provided in the box",5
"Good quality monitor. Been looking for a monitor for work related to graphics. Nice colours. Overall, it's a good monitor and if you are looking for a monitor for graphics design and such, just go for it(under Rs. 15k). I've paired it with Samsung SyncMaster B1930(the monitor on the left in the pics)",4
"My plan was to buy a 27 inch monitor but I did not have enough budget and at the same time I was not ready to compromise on quality also. So I decided to buy this monitor even though it is a little bit smaller in size. Believe me, it will worth every penny you spend, because the screen quality is really good and I am using this monitor as the secondary display for my MacBook Pro, and by doing so my productivity has increased really really well. So if your budget allow you to purchase a 27 inch go for it, otherwise you just order it right now and you will never have to regret about it.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Likes: screen when it works looks fine. 24 inch screen with slim bezel, good colours and easy on eyes. Ergonomics of this monitor is great

Dislikes: frustrating issue with flickering, see the video. I have ordered replacement, I will update this review once the I get to see the replacement.
I didn't like the plastic body and the USB hub sometimes don't work, I had to change the port of my attached device. The ports are at awkward position and it is hard to reach unless you rotate the screen. Their quality is not so great.",2
"I did so many research on the display size, display quality, display resolution and etc.. as a software developer we design and develop applications where we need color accuracy and text clarity for coding and stuffs, which is not great but feel strange blurry feeling while reading/writing the code(might be i am used to much higher quality display of laptops), most suitable for professional office work like excel and writing documents watching videos and surfing is exceptional as mentioned for this price range. and adjustable and rotatable display makes things much easier for users.",4
"Excellent monitor but do have done bleeding issue on corner...
Replaced one time but same issue... It's what you will get in this price...
If you want more better quality you need to go for premium range...",4
Perfect and cheap setup for macbook pro. It comes with 4 USB ports and you can use the monitor as usb hub. I have keyboard and mouse and headphone everything is connected to monitor and I just need to buy one simple hub to connect everything. Downside is it doesn't come with hdmi cable.,4
Stunning infinity display at a reasonable price. The monitor works perfectly well with my Dell XPS. The USB ports are an added bonus. It compliments perfectly with the Amazon basic vesa monitor mount. It has a comfortable view option making it ideal for the eyes. Higly recommended for those wanting to upgrade their working desk at a budget price.,5
"I checked with Dell support... they made me do some diagnostics by instructing on phone, made me took pictures and then send them. After analyzing the pictures they told me that this is due to internal damage and that it is not covered under warranty. All I can say is it worked fine the previous day - that morning when we turned it on, we saw that it had issues. There is no external damage and there was no cause for any damage as it was not even moved - it was sitting exactly where it was, the previous day. I do feel cheated by Dell as they sold a low quality product.",1
Purchased the monitor for general use and for coding....superb panel...the picture quality is amazing and so is the build by dell....the blacks are really good in this panel....overall it's a pretty good display.I got this one for 13999 which is the lowest I have seen it go and let me tell you that neither hp nor benq in this price range give such good color and well as such a sturdy build so I would suggest go for it,5
I have been using it for a month now. The monitor serves its purpose well and looks premium. 3-yr warranty is a good feature. Only thing i disliked is that they don‚Äôt give hdmi cable along which should be standard in these times. They give 2 another cables which i am not sure where to use.,5
"This is a perfect sized monitor specially if you have a Mac. There are extra USB ports within the monitor which you can use to plugin other devices. Picture quality is great & has good amount of brightness.
PS: Does not come with an HDMI, buy one separately. Use USB-C to USB A convertor for using the USB ports on the monitor",5
"Awesome as expected,
Pros
1 Thin bezel
2 multiple ports hdmi dp
3 Four usb sockets 3.0
4 Height adjustment
5 rotating base
6 360 display
7 usb 3.0 cable included in box
8 Three year warranty",5
"The Monitor is good, and only the monitor is good in every way

All the wires/cables included in the box are useless, they ship 16A power cable with huge 3 pin that doesn't fit the normal socket, also HDMI cable is not included

I bought a 14k Monitor at home in the covid situation, and still had to get out to buy further 500 rs cables just to make things work.

All and all worthless customer experience, but yes the monitor is good.",3
"Seller is shipping the product with over sized power cable plug,it needs 32 a socket to plug in.
Don't buy it as you can not use it with regular socket plug.",1
"Awesome product and delivery by Amazon .thanks a lot for tension free delivery and can't find any issues in this.

For other buyers - service tag detail is in the back of the monitor and u cn use this to check dell warrenty period. I have checked it for my display and confirmed 3 years 2023, from dell site.i was worried abt this so sharing the info",5
"Excellent for work from home. Accurate colour reproduction and anti glare.
For making this as usb hub, connect laptop with usb A to usb 3.0 B on monitor(cable provided in box) and you are done. After this, all 4 usb ports on monitor can be used for laptop.",5
Excellent product. Quick delivery. Product as described. But discrepancy in MRP as mentioned on the product and what is mentioned in the Amazon site. Hence discount is much less than what is stated. Beware!,5
"Writing review after 15 days of use.
Found it as a good monitor for professional work.

Prons:
Thin bezels give it a nice look.
Picture quality is perfect.
Anti-Glare is also acceptable.
Screen adjustment in every direction and movement is useful.

Cons:
It is producing current on the other corner of the cables, like USB and HDMI when connecting to port. Usually monitors do not produce. Not sure if it is normal.
I can see screen light on the top of the monitor.",4
"Best of the best monitor under 15k price segment. Picture quality is top notch. Very thin bezels as mentioned.
Very good monitor for professionals and also for photoshop and premiere pro.
Coming to the stand of the monitor, very ergonomic.
If you buy a monitor, make sure it has a stand like this one has. (Can rotate the screen upto 180¬∞ both clock and counter clockwise plus tilt and pivot)
Overall, completely satisfied with Dell P2419H.",5
"Good monitor but required cables like hdmi is missing. Also the power cable is very big and it initiates another additional purchase.
If it can work with 6A or 10A adapter then what is point in giving 15A.",3
"Good display for the price
Love the flexibility to move screen anywhere.
No HDR Support (Not great for Media Consumption)
Dell Display Manager Software is not available for Mac (Brightness or Mode Settings needs to be set by pressing buttons in the display)",3
The unboxing was a good experience and from the looks and feel it does look premium. I am hoping to have a good experience with my photos and video editing projects. Maybe i can review them on that regard later.,4
"The picture quality of the monitor is really good and design is sleek, elegant and just WoW !!!
Must buy for people looking to extend work monitor into something bigger and beautiful. I have connected my Laptop with Alexa and this Monitor - which has enhanced the movie experience on the Monitor by 1000 times.",4
"Nice monitor quality is good, good for coding and office work. but they should have provided hdmi cable and monitor doesn‚Äôt contain inbuilt speakers or haradphone jack.",5
Just received the monitor but it does not have VGA or HDMI cable it only consists of D Type HDMI & SSD along with power cord.,3
This is first time that I've got an external monitor for work. Could've provided cables but not a big deal. Has 3 types of inputs. It also has 4 USB ports which comes really handy. Picture quality is great too. Plus the screen angle can be adjusted and rotated to any angle of convince. Product feels very sturdy.,5
"Nice monitor. Easy to setup and very flexible.
Comes with usb data cable and dp cable. You need to order a HDMI cable separately.

*Some cons I noticed for my usecase:*
- I find the max brightness to be a bit low.
- Also, no shortcut for quick brightness adjustments. You need to go into the menu and then to screen and then brightness to adjust it.",5
"Monitor came with 16amp plug but the standard socket in India is of 6amp. There is no need of 16amp plug because all the other similar monitors work perfectly fine with 6amp plug. So I have to buy 6amp plug separately? Please mention in the product description, and HIGHLIGHT that part.",3
"Great ,just the right size. ANot to big nor too small. Very flexible in changing degree of view and rotation of screen. Been using it for almost 3 minths now. Just the right colour brightness and also with the driver installed on your pc , picture quality ,scale can be customised.
Have been gaming on this also ,, good for normal gamers of valo and csgo until you are not thinking of competitive esports.
So finally advice,, go for it.",5
"I am using this for a month as a secondary monitor. Good build and looks, came packaged very well, easy to install. Good picture quality. Height adjustable and can use in horizontal or vertical mode. The display can also swivel with the stand base remaining at the same position. I use it for about 10 hrs/day and great to watch 4K videos",5
"Worst product and service by Dell and seller

Display port stopped working in 3 months.
Complained dell support,they said my monitor will be replaced.they asked for all documents and invoice, I mailed them. Now they are denying any replacement without any explaination.
They closed the case without any proper justification,neither they are replying to any mails. PATHETIC AND WORST SERVICE BY DELL AND DEFECTIVE PRODUCT DELIVERY BY SELLER.",2
"Hi Readers,

I would like to inform you that this not fake or paid review. This is an amazing product from dell. As a developer, I will suggest buying this if you are looking for a good Monitor.",5
"Monitor doesn‚Äôt work in Full HD resolution with Macbook Pro, it always says that can‚Äôt detect the signal.

"2019
Excellent product. Highly recommend it.

25/05/2021
The power cable provided is15amp is not compatible with households. I had purchased the exact same monitor (from a different seller) it had a power cable compatible with households. Also, the color calibration of this new panel is washed out with a bluish tinge. I requested for replacement of the product, promptly it was given but replaced monitor also has same issues and problems as previous.",2
Powe cable is fauly passing current to the laptop when laptop charger is kept in charging. Customer service simply passed the time instead of showing interest in fixing the issue. Dell has the worst customer service. Please don't buy this monitor.,1
"I ordered it for WFH purpose, using it for programming. I use it for long time like 10 hrs a day. And its really good, ""Comfort view"" is very useful and eye friendly. Eye does not pain at all.

Ergonomically good, Able to adjust it upward-downward and can rotate clock wise also. Also can be converted vertically as well.

Have purchased it in 13k seems to be good deal.

Size is perfect for programming type of task.",5
There is a white spot at the middle of screen and again I ordered second time but this time no lucky still got a defect monitor...does Amazon even bother quality check.,1
"I am recommending this to anyone buying monitor for the first time. A monitor is a combination of a screen and other little things which are often frowned upon.
1. A more than decent PPI monitor
2. Full HD and non flickering
3. Glare free
4. Comes with 360 degree rotation stand combo, which is vital.
5. Sturdy cables in the box
6. Lower power consumption",4
"The two cables provided are useless for someone with only HDMI connectivity. Product is ok but i had to purchase another cable for connectivity. All previous customers are complaining this but it seems manufacturer is not interested. Adding INR 150 cable would have saved a lot of hassle, specially when you are paying 13k.",3
Dell makes really good products. Very nice quality. Perfect monitor for programming and reading documents. It will glare if you have a window behind you. Nice color reproduction. Worth it!,5
Previously i used dell s2415h then i sold that after 3 yr use and i was missing that too much. Now i bought P2419H model and its perfect for work from home Purpose. I read some reviews that some of people didnot received service tag. But i got a product with service tag and i verified it on dell website its genuine. Bought it in 11.5k including card discount.,5
"After 5 months of usage suddenly the display was showing vertical lines and black patches on top.when contacted Dell for replacement,they refused to do so and said it was damaged internally which is not covered under warranty.As we are using this monitor for WFH purpose,this issue caused inconvenience along with money loss.Shame on you Dell for cheating customers with poor quality panels.",1
"Must buy. Worth every penny. Can rotate and adjust the monitor height. Also, it can be tilted vertically.",5
"This is the best monitor I have worked on. The screen is really good and of perfect size for work purpose and also for gaming purpose.
I only use for work purpose but I am sure it can also play games at good graphics.

After using for 1 month, This is the best monitor screen to work. Planning to get one more. The",5
"I purchased it for my office work, and it's optimum for the purpose it's for. Everything, be it build and picture quality, Dell Brand satisfaction or features all are upto the mark. The best part I like is USB upsteam, with which I just need to switch 1 single cable from1 laptop to other, for my wireless Mouse & keyboard to work on another laptop. Great thing and recommended Buy!!!",5
"This is by far the best monitor for the price. Other monitors might have all the jazzy features such as speaker output, etc but this one is what exactly a monitor should be. Height and angle adjustments are superb. Base is heavy, which is a good thing as it keeps the monitor stable. Price is slightly on the higher side but if you are looking for a good monitor for long term use then the extra bucks justify the price.",5
Monitor flickering when white screen...,1
"Awesome quality, I was looking something equivalent to what i have in office setup.

I got this one. Value for money",5
"Base product is good and working properly. The part I disliked is power cable that was sent. It is having a plug for 15 amp socket. Why would a monitor need 15 amps power? I have to purchase another power cable for 5 amps socket, for additional 300 rs, and that cable is not fitting well. Is Amazon or the supplier going to send me a power cable for 5 amps supply that fits nicely in the monitor.",4
This monitor is for ones who is into editing and content creation stuff. It is a great panel with ips technology. 3 stars for gaming because of its 60hz refresh rate. But you can play all high end games with stupendous picture quality. Optimising with nvidia geforce experience it enhances the video quality of gameplay more.. Overall a great stuff and value for money product.,4
"This Dell monitor has high build quality, and useful features such as USB ports and portrait mode.

Pixel density is not very high, and refresh rate is acceptable. Not well suited for high response gaming use-cases.

HDMI/VGA connectors not included in the box, so watch out for that.",5
"Pros:
Cheap
minimal bezel
Decent color accuracy(not pro grade)
sufficient adjustments
cons:
no usb c option.
usb A port can only deliver power.
IO shield obstructed by the frame",4
"P2419H is best in price range of 14K. It's look is super cool and picture quality is beyond I expected. Overall I find it good. Soetime when I see flashing like stars but not sure why that would happen, but it goes away in a minute or so. I prefer DP cable connection a d so far I am finding it good.",4
Perfect as expected,5
"This monitor is only for basic office uses, not for entertainment purpose and content creating and editing purpose, Very bad picture quality, the screen are too blurry and the accuracy was too bad, and screen full of backlit bleeding, and glare issues, I was returned this product.

Picture quality is good in the given price range.
Screen rotation feature is good.
Not good for gaming, fps in csgo decreases drastically when playing on screen while it's 3 times on laptop.",1
"Good for watching videos and movies but text tends to get blurry because of the size in email Apps. I noticed this coming from a 2K Dell monitor only. But not a deal breaker.

Button placement is below the screen which gives it a seamless look from the front.

Has got enough connectivity options.",5
"I bought this one as extended desktop. I am very glad that I bought this monitor. Have been connecting to my Mac, it has been good so far. The best part is easy installation, adjustable height as well as tilt.",5
"Monitor does what it is intended to. Picture quality is average and if you have a glaring background, then it is difficult. Screen modes are amazing. Flickr is there sometimes and adjustment levels are top notch.
Definitely recommend",4
"Saviour of work from home. Go for it. I have been using it for six months, it's really cool. I am not a gamer, so I cannot comment on how it's working in gaming mode. But for sure, one of the best monitor for work. I am seeing for more than 12 hours without much strain",5
"I bought the P2419H 24 inch Dell monitor for my home office. I do programming for long hours and this monitor is perfect for the job. Amazon gave excellent value for money.

"1. Good Picture quality
2. 4 USB ports really useful
3. All adjustments including height really comfortable.
4.meets all my requirement
5. Dvi and Usb cable in the box

Only one concern I had,power cord provided in the box is 16A .. usually socket at home usually is 10A so doesn't fit. Only few sockets in houses will be for 16A. I used different power cord.",5
Product is too good. I bought during lockdown at a price of 12500. It is worth a buy.,5
For all the programmers out there this is the perfect one. Two things I don‚Äôt like about this is it doesn‚Äôt come with hdmi cable and one dead pixel it‚Äôs so tiny but we can manage with that. Value for money 100% recommended. Screen quality is excellent considering the price. Over all good monitor for programmers and not recommended for gamers. There are other computer that you can get.,4
"works like a charm

Only thing was no HDMI cables shipped that was a big bummer. It costs hardly 3-4USD, it could have made customer's life so easy to hook it to a mac or Dell latitude with hdml interface.",4
"Hey this monitor remind me of my office life believe me it's amazing slim and having antiglare screen you can code in it for long as your wish, for debugging there is a plus point you can rotate the screen that's amazing. I highly recommend this product for you go for it üòâ",5
"Mine was having a vertical blue dotted line in the center (from top to bottom - as seen in the attached images). Searched on net, this is the common problem in Dell Monitors and the only solution is replacement.

I am lucky that my return period is still active. Trying to return it ASAP. Thanks!",1
"Stand is awesome.
Contrast is natural.
Colors are pure except for the yellow tint allover which is expected these days due to eye care certification
( R 92, G 93, B 100 in custom color removed that tint for me).
Do install ' DEll display manger ' software for easier switching of modes.",4
Good monitor to work from home. Has a autosleep mode and a few connectivity options. Looks good. Has height adjustment. Can be tilted sidewise. Matte finish.,4
"The cable socket that connects to the monitor is loose and gets disconnected every now and then.
Even when no one touching the monitor or laptop the connection goes off and you see nothing on the monitor.
this happens to both the HDMI cable and also power cable.
Defective piece has been shipped by the distributor.",1
"Not sure about it's anti-glare as it impacts your eyes too much even if you have blue light filter glasses.
As for other quality of the product, i think it's perfect.",5
"After using it for 10 days found that picture quality is kind of Ok, specially when you work with lot of text files, I'm using it for coding.

Other wise picture quality is good when you see the video on this.

Dell has to include the HDMI cabel with it.

Amazon has to work on delivery it took 7 days to reach me.",4
"Works very well. Good pan tilt swivel movement. I like the usb 3.0 ports.
Good quality screen with slim bezels.

Vendors are increasing prices due to demand.",5
The screen it's not straight and downward screen.There is no adjustments to place screen straight. Can't left the screen up and downwards. Made a mistake buying this monitor can't even return. Waste of money.,1
"I had recently commented on missing HDMI cable with this product. But, soon as they received my feedback on the product the seller immediately dispatched the cord to my doorstep. Thank you seller ""Sold by: StorazeBiz""",5
The monitor is really awesome. But important thing. Download dell display manager . It's also support other important features as well. Like dividing the monitor into multiple screen it's self. For using the vertical feature please 1st select the display selecting > display> display orientation. Overall this dell product is really nice and value of money,5
This product doesn't perform as premium as it looks. You can find better monitor for the price. Picture quality is really dull to a point where you can see the pixels on the screen. Design wise it's the best in the market for the price range but the picture quality is bad. I've used other dell monitors which were really good but this one disappointed me.,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Color reproduction issues",4
"Using it for day to day compute.
No game play.
Good so far.
Package contains a D Port cable and Not HDMI.

HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT is the key feature it comes with a good stand.",5
"A brilliant product from Dell.

Clarity, build, style - everything is top notch.
Special mention for the monitor stand. It lets you move the monitor in a wide range of angles.

It is priced above its peers from Samsung & LG.
But it is well worth the price you pay for.",5
Good product. Easy to adjust angles and height. Heavy and strong build quality. Screen comes with mat finish so protests eyes also.,5
I bought this for coding mainly and when I connected the script was all blurry and hard to read. I had to update my laptop's display driver coz of windows' bad dpi adjustment. Now my display looks crisp and you may have you tweak the colors of the monitor a little as the factory settings were too warm for me,5
While watching YouTube video lags sometimes because of low frame rate and colors are not bright enough...it is good for general purpose only like surfing web page and also for static content.,3
"Monitor is great, good picture quality, range of motion is awesome, you can swivel left/right, pivot to vertical, and pan the screen up/down. No glare issues. Giving 4 star because 16AMP plug was given so had to buy a converter plug, also would appreciate 1 HDMI cable than the display port, one other cabel provided.",4

Everything looks good except the 16A plug that it comes with.,4

"I am using this monitor with macbook pro 13' 2020 and dell 7560 as an extended screen for programming. The monitor is working as expected. The resolution compared to macbook is low, So might see pixelated font but won't be an issue.

Along with the monitor , I bought HDMI to HDMI cable and Apple USB C to Digital AV multiport adapter.",4

- Connectivity options
- Fit and finish
- Height and rotation adjustable
- Thin bezels
- Optimal brightness for longer duration",5
"The product is good and sleek. Display is sharp, brightness can be adjusted. Dell has always been good. The monitor is height adjustable, tilt adjust and left right adjustable. You also get a DisplayPort and USB 3.0 upstream cable, along with the monitor. Assembling is very simple. Liked the product.",5
"The packing was good but there was major damage with the screen. It was broken so bad and there was no display at all. Quality check was a complete failure. It was a complete waste of time. I had to return it immediately. Now I am too scared to trust any seller, as I am not ready to go through this turmoil again.",1

This is best product from dell. I highly recommend buy this product from trusted seller",4
"Iam using it with Mac this solves the purpose of a good monitor with USB hub. The quality is good for work, movies. Not so good for gaming. Ergonomics is good. For the price point it is very good.",5
"It is very good monitor for general daily work for watching videos, coding, office work, movies. I have not faced any issues. Note that you need to purchase separate HDMI cable for this. Colours and quality is clear.

I have not tried it for gaming so I can't provide feedback on that but it should work well for gaming as well.",5
"In Delhi only one service center is there for this model and they straight forward denied for any support (paid/unpaid). Simple claim, they don't have material to support this variant.",1
"Very clear picture quality and build quality. Best feature is height adjustment and 90 degree rotation to either side. Has display port, hdmi and vga inputs. Also comes with a usb cable so that two usb ports on the side can be used for pen drive etc.

Nice professional look. Thin bezel.
Good picture and easy settings. Easily accessible physical buttons.
2 Cables included (Not HDMI but newer versions)",5
Excellent monitor. I am buying one more. I can‚Äôt imagine there is a better one than this. The fact that you can change the angle of the monitor snd the fact that you can use this as a USB extension are huge advantages. Go get it! This is perhaps one of my best purchases from Amazon!!!,5
"Been using it as a 2nd monitor connected to my laptop that runs Linux (Ubuntu). Works flawlessly -- plug and play.

I've tried using both VGA and HDMI cables, and both of them work fine in Linux. (Note that the cables weren't included, and I had to purchase them separately).",5

"I bought is in 12,200 Rs...
Excellent Monitor for Photo Editing,

Only one thing is missing that is VGA Cable",5

But, there are no in built speakers, and height adjustment is absent as well.",5

Every thing was good accept after 3-4 days of use later the monitor screen started to light bleed and I there was also a dead pixel I have filled for a refund let's see what happens for some reason there wasn't an option for replacement. I will try to update this review after the refund or replacement,2

After 1 day of use..... I think this monitor is one of the best monitor....... With Good pictures Quality and Color output. And I hope that same performance I will expect in future also.....,5
Picture quality is good and display is bright. This is a great buy for work from purpose. This monitor has height and tilt adjustment which is very useful. This not for gaming though casual gaming is okay.,5
"While the monitor is good but the power cable is loose and does not fit fast to the monitor. Because of that, with little shake of the cable the power goes off. Please consider replacing the power cable of good brand. This cable is made in China.",3

"Excellent build quality, fully adjustable, rotatable monitor stand.
USB ports are a plus",5
It works really well and we haven't had any issues with it so far!,5

"I bought it for PS4 gaming and it's absolutely fine, what I can say is a mid range monitor that satisfies your needs. Value for money. It doesn't has a backlight bleed issue.",4
An option to choose HDMI to HDMI or Display port cable would be a better option. My laptop connects with HDMI cable but I got a Display port cable which is not useful for me.,4
I don't want that anti glare. Thats the only issue for me..,4
Does it work for what it meant to be. I bought this product at 12.5k n again want to set-up Duel monitor but this time it's price got increased to 15k plus. Sure to COVID-19,5

Very good quality and size is perfect,5
"The Product comes with 16A power cable and this info is not present in product description, same monitor i bought 1 year ago and it had 10A power cable.
why would a monitor require 16A power cable! and why is that info missing?",3
This thing doesn't have speakers. I guess that's because it's meant for office use. So no harm done. It's a beautiful display to get your work done.,5
Good Monitor Daily Development Use With Anti Glare Feature,5
"Monitor is awesome, nice picture quality, better resolution. But the packaging was not up to mark only a bubble wrap around the box.",5
Great relief for my eyes after straining for months using a laptop. The screen is just the right size for a desk top and has a sleek design besides having everything you could ask for in a work monitor.,5
Damaged product delivered. There is a verticle split across the screen which gets visible when monitor is powered on. Chinese manufactured product of poor quality.,1
Picture and over build quality are awesome. It is the best monitor for who do coding a lot. Only drawback is Audio output which is missing. So you can‚Äôt use Chromecast in this monitor.,4

I am disappointed with one thing that i can not mount on wall using vesa mount. I ordered vesa mount bracket but this monitor do not have slot for screw to fit.,4
The product should include an HDMI cable. I mean why are you not including HDMI with this??,3
"I have been using this product for more than a month. I find this really useful while working from home. Also, I bought another one and gifted to my friend. Increases your productivity while wfh.",5

Quality is less,4
The screen size is perfect and the flexible options in height/tilt adjustments are helpful. Recommended.,5

"No: 1 This is just a 24'' monitor and not a 2 Ton AC or Refrigerator, not sure why a 16 amp 3-pin power plug is provided. I ended up buying another power cable as there is no replacement for this. Any damage to monitor due to this power cable change have to be on customer as Dell consider as non-factory delivered cable.
No: 2 DP Cable, most of the laptops have HDMI but DP cable comes with the box. I have 3 Dell and 2 HP laptops in the house, none of them have DP port. What is the purpose of sending DP port when most of the desktops and laptops support HDMI port and not DP Port.",2
"Using the same model for Office work and its great. You can use it horizontally, vertically, set the size to desired length.

Purchased it for Home usage from Lappieworld in Amazon for decent price of 12900 with citi cc discount. It's great with nice packaging. No issues so far. Value for money. Book HDMI or VGA cable if you don't have DP in your laptop. I bought Nextech HDMI 1.8mtr as one laptop didn't have Display Port. For other laptop I am using DP cable provided with the box without issues.",5
"Im using last 2 months,

Quality awesome

Btt if u are searching monitor for Photoshop or any purposes of designing or editing, color grading, dont buy this item

Im photo editor and film-maker, my experience is very worst with this monitor

Colours are not good",3
This is an amazing monitor with 3 years Advance Replacement Warranty from Dell with Rich and Sharp colours it make your every penny worth.,5
"Bought it for 9500 in offline store
Best monitor in 10k price range",5
This monitor has got great picture quality. I've been using this product since 5 months for office work and bit of gaming.,5
"There‚Äôs a white patch in the monitor and there‚Äôs dust inside the panel. The technical support from Dell is unresponsive and lethargic. It‚Äôs been about 36 hours since the complaint was raised and no resolution yet.

Not sure if it‚Äôs a refurbished product.",1
"NEVER EVER BUY DELL MONITORS JUST BOUGHT A DELL P SERIES MONITOR FROM A LOCAL DEALERSHIP IN CHENNAI,IT STOPPED WORKING ON THE 4TH DAY,PATHETIC SERVICE CENTER'S,NOT MORE THAN TWO IN ENTIRE CITY,NOW IM STUCK WITH THIS CRAP,NOBODY IS WILLING TO FIX THE MONITOR'S IN CHENNAI.",2
"Good product
Using it for wfh purpose and serve more than expected , usb option is the highlight
It‚Äôs highly recommended to buy",5
Its a Monitor and that too from Dell.They must include VGA atleast. nothing provided apart from DP cable. Not every laptop have this port. Stupid.,3
"Product is too good, I haven't face any problem with this monitor.",5
"I bought this product 13,800 offline.
We need to buy separate HDMI cable.",4
"Dell is awesome i like the viewing angles , great fully recommended good for programmers and content lovers go for it.",5
"Good to work. Height and angle adjustable. Using for graphics, powerpoint etc..
HDMI cable supplied with the monitor is not compatible. Need to purchase one which is compatible.",4
I had used this monitor for 4 years. That's why i purchased this. It is a very good professional monitor for WFH.,5
Overall this time Amazon delivery is good and product also good.,5
"Dell P series monitor 24-inch professionals series monitor
best for work from home

Long time working monitor
good price range monitor !!!",5
"great monitor for WFH. got it for 12.1K , Value for money. Like the stand, monitor rotation options, picture quality.",5
"Same price you can get full HD Mi TV of 40inch, which can be used as monitor as well",1
Does it have speakers inbuilt,5
"Superb product by dell, thank you Amazon for delivering",5
Good,5
"Using it with Macbook pro 2017 and working so far so good.
It comes with matt screen and anti reflective coating.
Stand is super sturdy and display can be moved in almost every possible and usable angle.
Being a P series monitor its colour accuracy seems good.
and oh yes the side bezells are too slim so its a pretty good show off .
Good job from DELL.",5
"I liked this very much. I wish I could purchase 2 of them to emulate my office atmosphere. The screen appears almost as good as a big sized dell laptop monitor. pretty elegant with very small bezel . Less strain on eyes, not glossy - the matty finish makes things look pretty decent. Fixing the monitor the first time is also so easy . I am comparing all my experiences with another brand's monitor that I purchased for 10000 (I don't want to mention the name of the brand). After comparing that with that of Dell, I would say this is too good.",5
"Anti glare is perfect
Good colors
Menu interface is good
Height rotation all are perfect
Heavy base

DELL one of best panel but I wont give full ratings as all I got power cable and DA cable in box.
VGA and HDMI cable are missing.
Plz send me HDMI cable atleast and honour this good PANEL with good ratings..",3
"Perfect product. It arrived on time with no damage. The packaging was pretty good. At this price point, this monitor is just perfect with great viewing experience and mobility. The stand is pretty durable and can be adjusted as required.",5
"There‚Äôs a white patch in the monitor and there‚Äôs dust inside the panel. The technical support from Dell is unresponsive and lethargic. It‚Äôs been about 36 hours since the complaint was raised and no resolution yet.

*Not sure if it‚Äôs a refurbished product.*",1
"I brought this monitor during sale, it is a professional quality monitor, for any one who spend a lot of time working on computer this is a good option, best part is the stand, can adjust as needed for an ergonomic posture. Picture is FHD so individual pixels can be seen at this screen size, if you look closely but it is not a concern. Go for it",5
"I bought this laptop after lockdown.

Best laptop to go with for those who do a lot of work. Easy to rotate (the feature I loved the most)

Screen quality is just amazing. Would have included speakers.",5
What a great product! It's just a beast I call. A great product with good picture quality. Built quality is awesome and the monitor itself is best in the market. Go for it without any doubt. It will satisfy you %100.,5
Awesome Product,5
Good product,5
Works as advertised. I use it 14 hours a day and it works absolutely fine.,5
"It is very good for the price
I am also using U series Dell 24 inch.
The pi icterus sharpness is better",4
The quality of the image is really good,5
Very good product..,5
"Nice product and great delivery. One thing, HDMI cable not included in this box",5
"This monitor performs as well as my old samsung monitor but I'm disappointed with the power cable. It came with 16A big cable. I can't use it anywhere in my room. I have this 16A socket only in the kitchen. Now what do I do with it? If you plan to purchase this monitor, beware of this problem. You will have to buy an extra power cable from a computer shop nearby which would cost around Rs 200 or you have to connect it to an AC power socket if available or fix a new 16A box nearby your pc or get a 6A to 16A converter socket(Very unsafe ). When I tested this monitor with my watt meter, it measured only about 19W in movie mode with best brightness. I really wonder what the design team were thinking when they have decided to use a 16A plug which can carry over 3000W power when our requirement is only 19W power.",4
"Product:
Edge to Edge Screen.
Anti-Glare is Okay.
You can dim the brightness and choose eye-protection if you are going to 24x7.

Seller Issue:
I had ordered for BenQ GW2475H 24 Inch on Deal of the day but, I got the 22Inch instead same model. Difference amount was around 700 in Indian Currency. I have asked them to replace the items, and they asked for 7 Days. Still, I didn't got any response from them.",4
"The product arrived in well secured package.

I was able to connect with my macbook pro using type c to hdmi converter. My first impression is it's a very good buy for those who are looking for office purpose or coding.
I wanted 2 hdmi port monitor and doesn't want any speakers, so this was the correct pick for me.

This have a tilt angle of maximum 20 degree.

Please note that this comes with a 16A power cord , bigger than normal power plugs.",4
"First of all the amazon's packing was elegant and classic.
About the monitor
1. The picture quality is fantastic and you can watch almost all 4 k videos without a lag
2. Viewing angle serves a better touch.
3. About the brightness, you can adjust the settings according to how comfortable with your eye.
4. Best for blogging and programming, and can play 1080p games with ease.
Overall a better performance with this price range.",5
Worst experience..terrible amount of screen bleeding in main order and replacement as well,1
"Very much satisfied with this product. Picture quality and colours are really good. Image and text are crisp, colour saturation is neutral and adequate, 2 HDMI inputs, Low Blue light modes, anti-glare.. perfect for the price.. I've used other 24 inch models which are far more expensive, and this Benq model is in par with those ones!

There's another higher price model GW2480 with inbuilt speakers and magic eye option (I really don't think it's a needed feature), and if you don't want these option, this model is the best you can get!",5
"I needed a monitor to extend my laptop on a bigger screen and reduce some unusual strain on my eyes as well as use my PS3 in my room instead of the TV. Got this one as it is a 24"" IPS with dual HDMI and was priced just right @8999. Got it for approx Rs 8100 and it's a perfect VFM product. No dead pixels, no baclight leakage (just the usual IPS glow)
The 16 amp power cord is an issue and I knew about it so got a cord locally beforehand for Rs 70. All good for this VFM monitor, picture looks good and colur and viewing angles too are good enough.
Gaming on PS3 has been good with good colour reproduction & no noticeable ghosting or delay. No speakers in this one and it was known but I didn't go for the model with speaker which was priced 1K more as it nowhere read Dual HDMI which this one did and hence I traded off the speakers for Dual HDMI (Or so I believe but then speakers were never really important for me and Dual HDMI was a must)",5
"The monitor is good for this price range. Especially if you have to use 2 hdmi ports then go for it.
You can get it outside for less than what is quoted here.
The brightness level is quite low even for max brightness.
Overall it is a good product and would recommend it for the price. I didn't play any games or videos on this monitor, just normal viewing.
The vga and hdmi ports work perfectly.
Not very sure of the customer support in case of any problems.",4
"Everything as expected. Not sure if the eyecare thing actually does anything or if it's just a gimmick. But it is a high quality monitor. Great colors, clarity, brightness. Great for coding and general purpose monitor.",5
"It's overall a good monitor. But... I don't understand why in this earth, this monitor needs 16A socket to operate. My 350 litre refrigerator needs 6A, my 55 8jch Smart TV require 6A even my UPS & CPU need 6A to run, then why this monitor needs 16A current to run?",3
"Perfect on time delivery. Neatly packaged as well.
Display is very good for the price. Also has an audio out port if you are using a ps4 or xbox with it.

Overall a nice choice for this price.",5
Got this as my second monitor for the WFH setup. It's got VESA option and very slim bezel.,5
"According to the picture quality it is perfect. Anti glare is also ok. Gaming I have not explore yet coz of different field.
I read in the question and answer section that GW2475H is an improved version. GW2480H has some issues.",5
Purchased this in the Republic Sale and it got delivered to me in few days. Image Quality and colors seems very better on this as compared to other display's.,5
"Looks good but the only problem is with the plug,it comes with 16Amps big plug, won't fit to small sockets, need an adapter to get the job done.",4
"I am satisfied with all my expectations ‚ò∫Ô∏è, but if hdmi is connected I am getting the exact clarity, but when I connect vga cable ...I don't. Not too much of difference you could find. But it still worries me. Other than that everything is perfect and worth the money üí∏",5
very good packing and decent performance. Good for office use and long time viewing. - not sure about games or any other perfect HD viewing options.,5
"Superb quality..
Many eye care adjustable options",5

"Don't go for it , service is very poor I had shared the above picture to benq service team seeing the second picture they claimed it's a physical damage though I asked them to send a technician to inspect on it they were comfortable just replying on email after sending this first picture no response . Never go for it I had a worst experience dealing with this product",1
"This is good monitor.. however, power cable is 16 amp .. which will not fit in any UPS:).. I bought 5amp power cable separately.. not sure what benq was thinking while suppling 16 amp power cable :D",4
"First impression. Liked it very much. Eye care technology is really soothing to the eyes. Good design. One thing to be noted is the cable comes along with the monitor is for 16A power plug. Worth every penny we spend, recommneded!",5
"The colour accuracy is really great. Looks great with narrow bezzles. On paper, the brightness might be just 220 nits (theoretically lesser than its competitors). But upon using it, i found the brightness to be just perfect in a well lit room too.
Good for professionals (CAD, 3D or photoshop work) as it boasts of 103 percent sRGB. (I didn't need a monitor for gaming which was above 60hz so this was just perfect for my use case)
The only downside is that the plug/power cord provided within the box has a chinese plug head which means some of you would need a connector/spike guard to power it on. I didn't have that problem as my switch board has modular switches so it easily plugs in.
The backlight bleed is negligible. Nothing to worry about there.
Generally you get deep blacks with led displays and not ips displays. But believe me, while using this ips monitor, you won't feel anything odd. For it's price, it is offering much more than what you pay for.
The height isn't adjustable but frankly, thats not something you do on a day to day basis. It has tilt option though. This 24 inch monitor has a standard height for itself which is perfect in terms of ergonomics.
Overall i am totally satisfied with the purchase.",5
"I bought this monitor purely for the colour accuracy and I wasn't disappointed at all. It looks, feels, and works like a professional monitor right out of the box. It boasts of a 103% sRGB rating and is pretty much accurate. Aa a designer, I use it primarily for graphic designing and rendering applications. The brightness is perfect for an office or home setting. It has advanced options for setting up colour profiles if required. The only thing that could have been better was the contrast ratio. This monitor has the standard ratio of 1000:1. If it was 3000:1 it would have certainly been better but the panel technology won't allow for that I believe. Overall it's a great beginner monitor for professional and at this price (INR 9k) this is one of the best out there.",5
"Display is so colourful and it's anti glare finish really amazing. Borderlands design really give it an edgy style. Overall for editing purpose I say go for it.

Prefer lower brightness only. Some Filter settings may change the colour of the display.",5
"This is a really good monitor, the picture quality is good and response time is also spot on. No second thought on going for it.",5
Very nice product. brightness is very good and colour accuracy is super fine. Loved it.,5
Best,5
"Summary - It's a good monitorüëç

Now the details
‚Ä¢ It's a 1080p display for 24inch screen so if you're sitting any closer than 60 cm you'll notice pixelation .
‚Ä¢ On Google you might find 102% sRGB (CIE 1976) but I truly prefer my eye vs the numbers so I don't think it is yaa it's accurate like 96% but not 102% cause only problem I noticed is the colors are a lil brighter .
‚Ä¢ It's response time it 7ms and refresh rate 60hz so it's okay for casual gaming.

My final verdict - It's really good for a home pc or a basic gaming pc . And to all the photographers yes the colors accuracy is good.

For any other question Please text me on my Instagram - @pranjal_mikaelson",4
"102% SRGB AND IPS PANNEL
BORDERLESS ,Anti glare and wall mountable
AWESOME PRODUCT , Strongly recommend
Nice packaging and slim PANNEL",5
"Amazing Product, Superb Clarity, good for WFH and even office use. Proper size. Good product for web designer, coders, programmer.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Superb choice...Samsung always best...",5
"Likes :
1. Light weight and sleek. Very easy to operate
2. HDMI cable is provided as part of the accessories
3. Picture quality is very good, and there is option of shutting down extra blue lights..very good.
4. For ~7K, this could be the best LED monitor. Most of this price band are LCD and heavy.

Dislikes/Nice to have
1. height adjustable stand. The current stand is only tilt adjustable
2. Only one HDMI port.",5
"The monitor is incredible. Slim bezels ani 75 hz refresh rate and great display.

However i have 2 complaints

1)The screws holes that go with the stand and monitor are poor . It took a lot of force and wiggling here and there to fit the correctly even after that i am not sure its a perfect fit

2) they havent included an audio port.
Its 2020 cable management is of utmost importance imagine you need to connect your laptop with the monitor you need connect both the audio and hdmi to the laptop.
Hdmi transmits both audio and video!!
the why dont companies make use of this feature !!!",4
"All my excitement fizzled out when I turned on the screen.
There was white glow near top edge.
I hoped it disappears after some time but it didn't.

I complained to Amazon, and they decided to send a replacement.
I will be very sad and broken if next one has same problem again. :( :(",1
"Good monitor does it's job well.. Did a lot of research and was very confused between several models.. Finally chose this as this is a recent model compared to others which are couple of years old...
Good clarity, color reproduction and looks good.. Those who complain of light bleeding try to turn off the Eye saver mode, change Black level and check.. The eye saver mode purposefully emits background light to reduce contrast or something I guess... Overall satisfied with it",5
"if you want to game or content creation this is not for you if you want an ips display that is cheap and comes from a reputed brand go for it.
i have a benq rl2240he it has amazing blacks and grey to grey response of 1 ms this monitor is just a honda city in front of a Ferrari //referral for current situation don't act out yes for sure there are better monitors than both what i listed but these are the ones i know and so i use them in my analogy //

it is fine for content consumption or non fps or moba gaming but know this you would have to fiddle with setting to get the color accurate nerd in you satisfied, if you have no such predispositon feel free to buy without second look i got it for under ‚Çπ7500 and with direct vesa mount compatibilty this is a amazing screen for multi monitor setup. go for a 27 inch version that costs only ‚Çπ5 grand or so more than this one if you will be getting a single screen.",4
"No audio out put , no proper information about the product on the site",3
"The monitor stand is absolutely rigid. It cannot be adjusted for eyelevel or viewing angle at all.
The product says bezel less - because glass reaches nearly till end of the monitor but it has half a inch thick dead pixel boundary all around - so definitely not bezel less.",2
"I needed an external monitor for my work from home setup. This serves my purpose. Since i work long hours in front of computer i need a screen with good eye saver mode, Its always ON. Cant tell much about sharpness of image as i keep it on eye saver mode.

Use it only for work which does not rely much on color contrast like editing images on Adobe and etc.

Even though there is a 1 pixel defect on my screen i was too reluctant to replace it, as i hardly effects my work.",3
"The only reason, I brought this monitor is for WFH. I am not disappointed from it. The picture quality and sharpness is really good and has exceeded my expectations. They should have offered a 3.5 mm jack which is missing.
There is no heat emitted from the monitor at all. The brightness is a a bit to high even when set to 0, only in dark condition it may be discomforting. We have the option of eye care mode.
The refresh rate is 60 fps, you can push to 75 fps with AMD free sync",5
"I ordered this monitor , but there is some issue in that monitor ( white spots on life and right side on top ) so I replace the monitor , after that second monitor I got on 13 Jan but also in this monitor same problem but white shadow , I think it is natural in LED monitors in under budget LED monitors , it ok got it in 7699-/",4
"HONORABLE SIR, I HUMBLY AFFIRM AND CONFIRM THAT THIS IS A MONEY SAVING AND TIME SAVING EXPERIENCE FOR ME. REQUEST : IF POSSIBLE, KINDLY REPLACE ONLY THE LEAD SENT BY YOU. I NEED A LEAD HAVING TWO SCREWS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE LEAD TO CONNECT THIS SAMSUNG MONITOR WITH THE C.P.U. IF NOT POSSIBLE, THEN NO PROBLEM. I ACCEPT THE ITEM AS IT IS. WITH BEST WISHES AND REGARD. THANKS.",5
"Misleading: the country of origin is not India but Vietnam.
Aside from that, it's a great monitor.
The default refresh rate is 60hz but you can change it to 75 hz in display settings.
Only Hdmi cable is included.
Tilt is adjustable but only a little.",4
"1. Screen bleeding on the top edge & left edge on first purchase + on the replacement
2. On the replacement, the left side of the panel seems like a little yellowish (and on the whole screen there is some yellowish tint thingy going on)

NOW THIS IS FRUSTRATING.",1
"Best you can get for ~7K.
Awesome for casual gaming(upto 75 fps) and media consumption. Response time is good and 3 side bezel less design looks very stylish.
Go for it.",5
"I bought this for my PC, and trust me it works great. Its been 3 months now and i have no complaints. However, the stand is not adjustable and cannot tilt . It is a 75Hz pannel( make sure to change it in settings.) It has a eye saver mode which dims the display and makes it easier to see.
Talking about the bezels, they are really thin and provide a good look to your setup.",4
"All Is Perfect, no doubt go for it üôÇ",5
If you buy this product please check for power shock using the Electrical Screwdriver (Tester) near the HDMI port and VGA port after connecting to power cord. The Current shock transfers to my CPU as well through HDMI cable. I requested for replacement and the new product received also has same problem so I returned and bought different product which is working fine now. PLEASE BE CAREFUL GUYS by Tamil Nerdy Gamer YT,1
The problem is it‚Äôs thought to connect it. And it starts flickering if used the wrong HDMI cable (only works with the Samsung inbuilt cable). Thin bezels make it look good! Colour is good too. Worth the money. (Note it‚Äôs a FHD monitor which is 1080p),4
Overall Product is very good. . Display Panel quality is fine . the base is actually plastic but it looks good. .it only comes with HDMI Cable .no VGA cable Included in the package,4
"I ordered and got it 3 days ago worked fine. but suddenly these white lights came up and in starting it was at one corner but slowly it started showing up on upper right hand and even below.
No height adjustment or tilt.
If you‚Äôre lucky you might get a better product.
Has no speaker be aware of that fact.",3
The monitor is having both humidity as well as vga connectivity option the package includes a humidity cable the display is good and delivers what it promises in the specifications overall satisfactory purchase.,5
Bleeding issue,2
Quality wise is good. But it would have been great if I could have flexibility of tilting or adjustable screen direction,3
"Just perfect, go for it, wont get better in <10K.
The IPS LED Panel just blew me away.",5
This product is worth buying..... At this price range this LED monitor is top notch and have a premium quality experience monitor is full hd and its experience is unbelievably awesome.,5
Nice monitor and this monitor so slim so i suggetion budget this monitor compare to another monitor very small bleeding,5
This monitor is good. But bad thing is that panal is not very good quality. And also in this monitor has problems in top corners. There was white light bleeding. I read all comments on this monitor and i have same problem.,3
Nice product üññüèªüññ,5
Appropriate size for second screen,5
"Overall its nice, but for doing development work the size may be a bit small.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.

HDMI cable is included and the product is tilt adjustable. Full HD and I use it for work and stare for 10 hours a day it‚Äôs easy on blue light. A product value for your buck.,4
"Built and display quality is fine , and it looks good too but there was a deal pixel in the one I received as it was on lower bottom it was hardly noticeable",3
Good Packing & Good monitor at this price range.,5
"Able to stream 4k HDR h.265 encodec video smoothly, have better saturation and contrast. Refresh rate is also good. I would have more like it if it also comes with a analogue cable along with HDMI cable.",5
Display is little brighter.. otherwise good product,4
"if you're in this budget range then with no doubt go for it. It has a really good display with free sync of course and for gaming, this size is decent.",5
"Bought in 7000/- One of the best buy

"I was pretty surprised to see a sublet of Acer selling such a feature packed monitor at such a low price.
And best of all they were using VA panel and not TN(which are usually the cheapest and the worst looking).

Before i start my rant about its issues, let me say this, for this price you won't get Freesync and 144hz from any other brand, the blacks are pretty good and the panel gets decently bright.
And overall can be a decent buy if the panel issues are sorted out which i will discuss next.

So despite my apprehensions with this brand and Acer in general, i dived in and bought it, only to realize nothing ever comes cheap, and there is a reason why AOPEN monitors are so cheap, usually with monitors QA(Quality Assurance) plays a big factor when deciding the price. You see the more monitors you have to discard on the assembly line to maintain a certain level of quality, the more end users end up paying for that quality. I think by now you know why these monitors costs to less, for those who didn't get it, the QA department for such cheap monitors is pretty relaxed, they allow relatively bad looking panels to pass through to cut down the price.

For some this might absolutely be a non issue, but for the discerning user who values quality, i will not recommend this monitor, the proof is in front of you folks, the pics i have attached here show how a complete black backgrounnd looks on this monitor, its really funny because my 8 year old TN panel monitor looks way better.

It seems like we should expect less of panels now than we did 8 years ago(Added a comparison screenshot of this monitor vs my 8 year old TN panel, just look at the panel uniformity and backlight difference between the 2) !
The panel uniformity is all over the place, and if you tell me to look the other way due to the price, i won't because even the costlier Predator series monitors have backlight bleed and uniformity issues.

Ok enough talk about the first issue, moving to issue number 2.
Typically and technically IPS panels have the best color reproduction, followed by VA and then TN.
So i was expecting the monitor to have much richer and better colors than my TN panel, but sadly thats not the case, the colors are completely unrealistic, have an unnatural hue, and to add to that the monitor's edges are DIMLY LIT.
Caliberating the monitor on your own helps a bit but its still not a good VA panel.

Pros :
-------
Good Contrast ratio
Intuitive OSD
Decent Build Quality
144hz
Freesync(works with Nvidia gpus too now, but only with pascal and turing)

Cons :
--------
Pathetic backlight issues with dim edges
Really bad color calibration out of the box
Panel uniformity issues

Giving it 2 star due to all of this, because in my eyes a monitor should have a solid foundation(The Panel) and then adding extra features adds value, if your panel is this poor then whats the point in having all those features.",2
"the best under 30k 144hz, va panel, curved viewing angles r good & after sales service will be given by acer so if someone has 30k budget u can go with this also bezels r so slim to be attracted",5
"Really good monitor with crisp image quality. Totally worth the price. 144hz refresh rate and 2k resolution is a treat at this price. Freesync also works pretty good. Only thing is the brightness is 250 nits which is good but a bit low compared to other va panels out there. Viewing angles and colour reproduction is really good. Navigation controls are pretty easy with the joystick provided at the back.
Pros:
-Cheapest 32 inch display
-144 hz freesync works perfect
-no dead pixels or backlight bleed
-Curve on the screen gives immersive experience
Cons:
-Display brightness could have been better
-No speaker
-Cant swivel the monitor vertically 90 degrees
-Stand is very small and not firm when tilting the display up and down",5
"If you have 20k around to spare for a new gaming monitor, This Aopen curve gaming monitor is one of the best options available. I am really happy with the purchase. It took only 15 hours to reach.

Pros:
1. 144hz, so buttery smooth frames.
2. 4 ms response.
3. Curve display.
4. Has display port.
5. 27 inch, quite a big display

Cons:
1. 27 inch 1080p looks a bit inadequate of pixels.
2. 1ms response time would have been better, but considering this price damn I would have bought it with 5ms also.

Peace.",4
"INTRODUCTION:
I bought this monitor to replace an old TN panel that I'd been using forever. Its not without its issues but it does get quite a few things right. Hopefully this review will help you decide whether its worth your hard earned money.

PRICE:
I picked mine up during an Amazon sale when there was a discount offer and a lightning deal on the monitor. At that price, the feature set this monitor provides can't be beaten. The price seems to have gone up since then though.

BUILD QUALITY:
Build quality is solid. Stand is all metal, pretty sturdy and the monitor doesn't shake too easily. No swivel or height adjustment, but you can tilt the monitor from -5¬∞~ 20¬∞. No VESA mounts either. Bezels are not slim but not very thick either and have a slightly reflective finish. No stuck/dead pixels or any other visual defects to speak of.

CURVATURE:
The monitor has a curvature rating of 1800R. Curved monitors offer a larger perceived field of view. I had no problems going from a flat panel to a curved one, but it felt a little strange going back the other way once I got used to it.

UI:
UI is clean, easy to navigate and the exact same one found on the similarly priced Acer panel. Not surprising given AOpen is an Acer subsidiary. Fortunately, unlike the Acer panel which has normal buttons, this one uses a joystick which is much more convenient and intuitive but with one rather annoying design choice - turning off the screen requires you to keep it pressed for 5 seconds. Not ideal if you quickly want to turn off your screen before leaving the room.

IMAGE QUALITY:
Colors are ok out-of-the-box but you'll probably need to fiddle around with the settings a bit to get the picture you desire. I found the default presets a bit too warm for my liking so I had to tone it down a bit to get a more neutral image. You can switch the color temp between warm, cool, normal and lastly user mode which enables the RGB bias and gain sliders. The panel isn't very bright but a brightness level of 50-60 will be enough for most people. Blacks look pretty nice as they should be on a VA panel. All in all, with a bit of tweaking, you can get a pretty decent image out of the monitor.

VIEWING ANGLES:
There is gamma shift when looking at the screen at an angle. The image becomes washed out and less bright the further you move from the centre. But its not severe and its a non-issue if you sit right in front of the screen like most people do.

144HZ:
Now, onto the two biggest selling points of this monitor: 144Hz and FreeSync. You have to experience a 144Hz monitor to truly understand why so many people recommend one. Forget games for a second - your desktop experience is just so much better. Simple tasks like moving the mouse pointer, dragging a window around, scrolling up and down feel so much more fluid. And once you get used to 100+ fps in games especially FPS, going back down to 60 is something you'll want to avoid. Its not quite the horrible experience going from 60 to 30 but its still jarring.

FREESYNC:
As for FreeSync, the difference it makes is very evident. No more picking between screen tearing and input lag. And with the latest Nvidia drivers, you aren't restricted to AMD gpus anymore to use FreeSync. As long as you have a Pascal or later series card and a DPI cable, you're good to go. Just enable FreeSync in the monitor menu, then go to the Nvidia Control Panel, click on Set up GSync and tick Enable GSync, Gysnc compatible, Enable for windowed and full screen mode, and Enable settings for the selected display model. That's pretty much it. The FreeSync range is between 48-144Hz but you can extend it using CRU (Custom Resolution Utility). I have extended my range from 40-144Hz because FreeSync is even more beneficial at lower fps. 40fps on a FreeSync panel feels much smoother than 40fps on a non-FreeSync panel.

BACKLIGHT BLEEDING:
The biggest con, as others have mentioned, is that these monitors suffer from quite a bit of backlight bleeding. Its normal for IPS/VA panels to have a bit of backlight bleeding but its rather noticeable on these panels. I've had two of these, and on a completely black background or even when viewing a dark scene/image, you can see patches near the top and bottom that are brighter than the rest of the screen. Compared to my old TN panel, the black uniformity really isn't good. I mean if you stand far back enough from the screen, it kinda looks like there's a Batman logo on the screen. Of course, the severity of the issue ranges from unit to unit - the replacement I got was better than the original - but its still an issue albeit one that's only evident during dark scenes. If you get a decent unit, keep the brightness at sensible levels, and don't go looking at the edges of your screen every time the screen goes dark, its not something that will really bother you.

CABLES:
The DP cable that came with the first monitor was not only non-functional, it would stop my PC from even booting into Windows. I had to buy a separate DP cable to troubleshoot the issue. So if you're buying this monitor and plan on using FreeSync, keep a spare DP cable handy just in case. No issues with HDMI or DVI cables though.

SUMMARY:
Coming from an old 22"" TN panel, this monitor has definitely been a good upgrade. The pros sufficiently outweigh the cons in my opinion. Would I pay the current asking price for it? Probably not. But during a lightning deal and/or when there are discount offers, it certainly represents good value for money.",4

"Pros:
Supports upto 4k 144Hz (custom resolution), although the text turns out to be copy as it's not designed for it.
HDMI, DP, DVI, cables included within
1920x1080 , 144Hz on DP
1920X1080 , 120Hz on HDMI
Free sync+gSync compatible
Immersive curvature of 1800R
Fast response time of 4Ms
Colour correction menu from monitor nipple type button on the back
Not too big side bezels~1cm
Images quality is natural with sRGb colour profile and great viewing angles from sides.
VA panel, which is a trade-off for picture quality from IPS panel and response time from TN panels
Bright enough display with 250nits
Cons:
The stand takes some space in front of the screen
Height is non adjustable plus there is no wall mount of any standard Vesa or whatsoever
Not Windows HDR compatible, not that it hurts but it just doesn't support it.

I love it.
Here on I can not go back to 60hz ever again.
Will be back to edit this review after a few weeks.
If you're still thinking to buy this, just do it unless you could push your budget to 20k (which basically have the same traits but additional physical features like stand, looks, adjustable heights and all)

After about 8 months I first noticed some backlight bleeding when the screen goes blank. I was starteled at first but when the screen is lit, there really is no difference.
For gaming, you might need the overdrive to stay off in the monitor menu options > gaming to prevent ghosting effects of moving sharp images.the viewing angles are great and color reproduction still on point.",5
"Not even 4 months and the display started flickering, tried resetting, changing DP cables but still same issue, tried calling service number of Aopen 1800-11-4100 but number is coming as not available. Raised a ticket with Aopen for servicing the product in bangalore but no proper response yet, they keep telling they are looking into it.
Can't figure out how to get the monitor serviced, can anyone help please?",2
"This pocket friendly but enthusiast level specs makes it very affordable gaming premium monitor. This is a right out of the box review and may be updated as i go. qhd +144hz+curved+32 inch at 25k that's a very interesting grab. 144hz definitely feels smoother. All the color tech people include in their reviews and tells how bad this display is .... forget it. on an average day when you are playing a game or watching your fav movie you wont sit actively to notice all those. display is fine. unless you want to cherry pick its minor color calibration or brightness issues.
Curved display is actually much better than i thought for browsing and youtube than gaming and movies i noticed. the images or text on edges of the pages are a same distance as middle so thats gives a very comfortable view. So no regrets. its highly recommended. I shall update the review over the time.",5
"Unlike most people, I use this monitor with my laptop (which is very capable BTW) rather than a desktop. I would really recommend that you go for the 32-inch 2560x1440 version or the 24-inch 1920x1080 version as 1920x1080 is not really adequate for a 27-inch monitor. It is quite an immersive experience with the curved VA screen. On my unit, however, HDMI was very buggy. Video signal dropped to a blank screen pretty frequently which was very frustrating. Did not encounter this problem, however, with a DP to mini-DP cable (found a decent cable nowhere online except Amazon, the AmazonBasics version). The problem must be isolated as I have never heard anyone else have this problem. My specific unit has minor backlight bleed, fortunately. Could not figure out how to enable Freesync with a GTX 1060. Again, maybe it's just me.

The good :-
- Competitive price point.
- Huge 32-inch TV-like real estate to work with, with features of a monitor.
- Smooth 144Hz refresh rate.
- VA panel. Other monitors in this range are mostly TN/IPS 60Hz - 75Hz/really small.
- Freesync (Not useful to me, but useful for people with AMD GPUs, at least or those who could make it work with NVIDIA cards somehow).
- Curved. Very immersive.
- Relatively intuitive OSD.
- Adequately deep black levels.

The not so good :-
- HDMI signal issues (at least on my unit).
- Sub-par color calibration out of the box.
- Minor backlight bleed on my unit (but tolerable).
- One stuck/dead pixel right around the middle of the screen.
- No 90 degree rotate/swivel.
- No speakers, USB passthrough, etc (justified for the price, I guess).

It's not perfect. But it's great overall, nonetheless. Totally worth a recommendation.

Edit: Found one stuck pixel around the center of the screen. Edited the review accordingly.",4
