"Intex Bluetooth ""Made In India"" Good Speaker.Very Good Intex Speaker, Proud to buy this ""Made in India"" product from Intex. Snapdeal service was very quick but delivery by Bluedart was delayed due to Diwali.
Sound quality good.
Bass really very good in such a small set.
FM reception need an external antenna.
Tried USB, Bluetooth (works with all new phones), AUX and all works fine.
But at last Design & Sound matters, and for that I will rate  4/5 in both.
Request other Indian sound system company to make such good quality products in India.",5
"Nice Product.Nice look, nice sound...",4
"Nice Product.The speakers are good. Sound is really good as per my expectations. At this price the product serves best you cannot simply compare it to that of sony and philips speakers of high-end. Bluetooth connectivity is very good it can connect within the range of 30-35 feet. Once paired it takes 3-5 seconds to connect to your device.
I would like to thank snapdeal for delivering it 3 days before the delivery date.
I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for good speakers at this price.",4

"Sound quality is very bad and the sub starts cracking at volume 10 !! May be most of the reviews of this product are framed .. The subwoofer is a small 4 inch driver wih no base output, only low frequency noise.... I checked the product website and looks it to be a bogus one..

Request the potential buyers to stay away from this and look for different options. Unfortunately I bought this and there is no return policy ..

Definitely this is not a 80 watt amplifier ...",1

 After playing some of my favorite songs, I must say...In this price range this speaker is a very good deal. Very stable and balanced sound output with no distortion even on higher volume side.

You can control song and volume from the remote, you can also control it from your mobile when connected on Bluetooth and it‚Äôs a very good feature.

Elevn aura remembers last song played from USB even after power failure which is very smart. It‚Äôs remote control is much responsive.

FM feature is very good when you are out of song options and choices, sound is very pleasant.

Overall very good deal from a new brand. Waiting for more products from brand elevn.",5

 We were using Sony Soundbar in our 55inches TV, when we saw aura 80W 2.1 speaker we decided to order it. When we connected it with the TV, trust that the sound, bass and overall sound aura was as good as before. Shifted the Soundbar to the other room and using aura with the TV now. Watching movies are more fun and cinematic now. YouTube videos are sounding even better now, enjoying the music drop. So far so good. Happy with elevn aura speakers.",5
"Bought this 2.1 speaker for my office, got it in a very good deal; great price. Size is perfect for our office. Bass & Treble is just great. Connecting Bluetooth is hassle-free, connects in one click. My suggestion is to adjust the equaliser as per your song choices and you‚Äôll thank to elevn aura for amazing music experience.

You can use your Pen drive too as there is an USB slot. You will love the FM, it‚Äôs very good.",5
Dear Friends I'm Order Booked On 6th Feb & Received Day Before Yesterday Presently I'm Using At My Home Sound Quality Is Excellent Value For Money Based On Reviews I'm Order Booked & If You're Planning To Buy You Can.,5
"Sound quality is excellent for bass lovers. Home is vibrating like earth quake with full bass, VL 25 and TV equaliser tuned to sub woofer with wonderful performance. Bluetooth and FM is very high volume. So I have to reduce volume for that. All through remote control only. Little bit high cost, so waited for lightening deal and bought for 2999 rs.",5

"Exlent bass,and sound quality very very very superb ,remote control exlent , 5.0 Bluetooth conectivity was very exlent fully satisfied this price thanks to Amazon

"TBH, I had not heard about ""elevn"". I happened to find it while I was casually browsing through Amazon. I simply ordered it in a hunch and partly because of the buyers reviews in Amazon. Speaker quality is amazing! I'm totally satisfied with the product and highly recommend to anyone looking for a good audio experience. You won't be disappointed.",5
Value for money,5
"Product was delivered good way. Easy to configure and sound quality is very good. I am loving it. I am using for song, playstation and movie. You can also use the USB drive or SD card for content.",5
Best product under this price. You have to set bass between minus 3 to minus4 and treble between plus 6 or plus7 for getting the best output . Everything good except that it is not high definition! Those who want high definition sound like the sound from Sony it may not satisfy you.. Thanks elevn for the great experimental product,5
FM reception absolutely poor. The antennae wire is non functional. Sound quality is pathetic when tuned to FM. Overall sound quality with blue tooth and other devices is average. I would call the product over-rated when I compare the prices.,2
"Amazing sound quality, best in class body and great look and feel. We are more than grateful to Amazon listing a product like this and best of luck to elevn for their future products",5
Speakes is good but remote control is not function properly. Is it possible to replace the remote only?,4
"Awesome home theatre quality. Really liking d product. Everything gud. Loud sound,bass,treble everything gud.",5
It's not expected sound. Only for 10√ó12 room. It's not really 80W,2
"Speaker very powerful in this category
Subwoofer quality-normal",5
"Sound Quality is Good in Bluetooth and Aux.
But, it's lacking advanced connectivity options (HDMI-ARC, Optical, etc)",4
Good to have a full function remote. overall good sound and good value,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Hey you there stop scrolling, this is enough for you to explain....NO second thought just go ahead and buy this ....this product is not of local brand neither chinese cheap its US brand and and damn music output is just more then expected specially for bass lover trust me it will shake you heart. Its quite okay for a double room when you turn on it to full valume max it can irritate neighbors around you.
I would highly recommend you this coZ i swear you wont regret it rather then gettong a cheap local and chinese brand.",5

 The Only issue with speaker is, when I had connected to my laptop, I had change the sound settings as per my taste. And Increased the speaker volume from 11 towards above. Once its above 16 you will feal lack of bass and as of the sub woofer is spoiled. But this happens when its beyond the capibilty of the subwoofer. When connected to phone via bluetooth or aux I had no issue even at the volume 30.

For the price this product is worth it. Never expected a bass from this less price. However the bass has some resound within the subwoofer but looking at the price ots tottal6worth it.

In the video, there is a sound bar. Its not from Elven.

I have seen some negative reviews and was worried about the product. But the negative reviews are for the faulty products received to various customers.

So conclusion. For the price, the speakers are totaly worth it. Zebronics, Philips is not at all good infront of this. (5.1 and 4.1) You can go for Elevn.

If looking for premium bass and sound quality you wont get any speakers (Branded) under 4,000.",4
Superb audio quality,5
Bass quality is excellent.. Bass controls are there which i always wanted becuse these are always required according to quality of songs being played. I am happy i opted for it. Thanx amazon.,5
"this is fantastic and i luv it, ive been using various blue tooth speakers from creative, beats but this one is more qualified at this prcie range...just go for it,",5
excellent product go for it .unexpected volume just buy it,5
"The system has not a very clear and crisp sound. Everything is mushed up and you hear only the bass sometimes. They could put some better sound separators into the circuit.
But for the small price its OK.
If you want nice sound go for a another system",3
"Remote control very good, value for money, super sound quality.",5
Good sound quality. Only issue is the poor quality of the remote. It doesn‚Äôt work properly everytime have to adjust the battery and then have to press the required bottom for it to function. It‚Äôs very irritating. This is the only hack otherwise the stereo is fantastic.,5
"""Great look Great sound. Super Super Super sound system"".This is the best Home Theater in this price range. I use this from 25 feb. And I have no complaint of this .If you want a good speaker, you can go for it. I recommend for this sound system to all music lover. Dear Friends Don't miss this great Product .Thanks to Amazon Team and Thanks To Eleven Aura Team for this great product .I am so happy and I love this very much . I give to this product 101% stars .Thanks .....",5
"Received delivery on January 31st 2021, the USB holder fell inside on May 30th 2021 with minimal usage. On checking with their customer care, they got back stating warranty will not cover. To me it looks like a cheap product. Please do not buy this product or anything from this company.",1

"Well writing this review after thoroughly testing each feature.,Philips never compromised on the sound quality of their products..Have been using Philips audio systems since a very very long time..The expectation of products from Philips are huge as the build quality of Philips is way beyond comparison..After listening to audio from Philips 5.1 Home theatre audio systems was quite sceptical about buying a 2.1 speaker system but Philips proved me wrong..This is an awesome product designed by Philips the Bass is immersive, the audio quality is awesome and is very pleasant to listen.
Very satisfied with the quality.. Got it for around 10k after discount and card offer thanks to Amazonüòä

1.Bass level can be increased up to 30 max but would recommend to not go beyond 18/20.
2.System volume operating range is up to 30 max.
3.Different equaliser modes available.
4.Can play audio from USB,In built FM receiver,Aux input,Optical in,Bluetooth..
5. Speakers can be used as tower speakers or as sound bar..
6.Special mention the sub-woofer is true performer from Philips as always.
7.The sound output is superb even at volume level 2 and bass level 4/6, it‚Äôs really pleasant to listen at this range at night times offcourse with ur fav playlistüòä
Cons:
1.Remote plastic quality is not acceptable from a giant like Philips could have been better -No offence
2. Could have provided treble control but that doesn‚Äôt defer the quality of the sound output it‚Äôs just to mention consumers can adjust it according to their choice of treble level.",5
"It's really good....value for money....!
I like it...!",5
"It's a powerhouse. Amazing bass, music quality is very good. A lot of options to connect with everything. I'm mainly using it through Bluetooth and connected with my TV. But FM is useless and there is no display, which station is playing. Basically it is missing multi information display. That's the only negative point. I'm using it as s sound bar but love the option that it can also be converted into 2 speakers. Also on the main console the circular volume button is really cool. Remote does what's expected. Overall really good product. Packaging was not great as they just polywrapped the box and there was no outer amazon box what you generally get. Delivery was fast.",4
"We purchase certain items looing at the face value of the brand. I have been completely befooled & have decided never to go in for any Philips product, which was once a brand in sound quality. I asked for its return but was shockingly advice to get it replaced.",1
"I, as a connoisseur, do not like too much of bass boosting. Normal about 135 Hz bass for this system is fine as per human audible bass. Treble could have been better. But you cannot tell in details unless you play for some days to stabilize speaker magnate which improves with use.
Use after some days shows lack of clarity. Not a great one. I should have preferred local assembled as available in this web or a other Chinese ones. ( this is no doubt assembled in China).

Cons: The remote is not as smooth expected.",2
"I bought them 6 months ago & they started creating problem after few days. I managed it as the return window was closed. But few days ago the speakers suddenly went off. I tried different techniques to power them on but they didn't.
Finally, I called Philips customer care & spoke to one of the idiots who wasn't interested in dealing with it. Somehow he booked an appointment & said you will receive a call in 6 working hours. I waited for that call for 2 days......
Then I called Amazon & spoke to an advisor who politely advised me to call Philips customer care again & said that if they won't help then Amazon is there to help you.
I called them again and this time somebody really called me and visited my place to see what's wrong. He took 7 days to solve the problem as he was ill (which was fine).
He changed the motherboard & now I have the speakers working in a proper way & they are giving much better sound than before. Thank you Amazon.",5
"Sound quality is good. Remote stopped working after 6 months. Have seen similar where issues with remote have been reported. Luckily I was able to find a mobile app which works with this system. Sharing the app screenshots for the benefit of others. As there is no physical on/off buttons you cannot even start the system without a remote. Hence instead of running around to service centre or going for other generic remotes, this is a much better option.

But please don't expect all functions to work on the mobile app remote. Only basic functions like on/off and volume controls are working.",3
"Worst product and service from amazon. Dont Buy! At first the delivery was well packaged but the product was defective, i ordered for an replacement though it had been replaced the product came with an another defective Issue. Worst experience ever. Never buy from amazon ! Once it came with an defective piece its okay. But even after replacing the product had still issue as i have uploaded in the picture. Beware people ! No hope of ordering from amazon again .",1
"sound is good, but remote sensor is not good. we have to press button so many time. Remote performance is very bad",4
This is the speaker i have ever wanted. Clear sound and super bass makes it a great speaker. If you are looking for something that is rich in bass you can go for it. Delivery was fast and i received it safely.,5
"I am reviewing 4 days after using the product.
The sound quality is excellent, especially the rich bass it has (with bluetooth connection through my smart phone), the sound clarity is also outstanding.

However, I could not connect it to my Videocon d2h as rca cable was not included in the box, later I purchased 2 male to 2 male rca cable from local market and connected it to my Toshiba Led Tv, unfortunately the sound quality is very poor, I couldn't get any surrounding sound.
Bluetooth connectivity is average.
Remote control should have been better for a Brand like Philips.",5
"Not an original remote of philips. Even the remote is not in working condition.
You can see in picture spelling of philips is different. Worst product. Don't spend ur money on it",1
"After too much of reading reviews and research, I decided to buy this Phillips MMS2220B on a nice amazon sale day! Got a good deal less than ‚Çπ10k price.
Though it‚Äôs non returnable through normal channel, it‚Äôs very important to give this unit its burn down time. Sound quality on the first day and output it gave after period of 8-10days (2-3hrs daily run) tremendously improved. The bass & tremble improves and it‚Äôs low voice out is amazing as well.
Phillips is anyway much better than the Chinese ones (this is made in India!) and the technology is far better!
- FM radio works well but has little distortion in some channels (maybe had to fix the antenna outdoors) but it‚Äôs still give good output.
- Bluetooth linking is the quickest !! It connects without any issues and has the best quality output
- AUX - option provided but I didn‚Äôt see any difference between Bluetooth and AUX cable.
- Optical wire - I was surprised to see the optical wire also part of the package. It‚Äôs not mentioned and I had ordered the amazon OP wire as well. Best option to connect to make your TV a home theatre !!

Best this is the Bass output. Works really well in low volumes as well. I wish they had provided tremble option as well, but it works just as good!

Don‚Äôt understand why Phillips has such a cheap looking remote control!!

This unit looks classy and suits your living room! I would say best in class in terms of looks. Speakers can be attached and wall mounted as well as one piece.

You would need to use this for min 10days to get the best output and ensure you have proper acoustic set up in room . Placing of speakers as recommended works the best !!

Best Buy during a sale!!",5
Sound quality is good and it has multiple source input which makes it one of the best speakers in the segment. But the only drawback with this product is the wire length. Both the 3.5mm connector and the wires for the satellite speakers are very small in length. At least a decent length wires should have been given so that it can be set up with proper spacing between speakers and woofer for better sound quality. 3 stars for this reason otherwise its a 5 star worthy product.,3
"This is my favourite mutlimedia system Everything was fine but the woofer started making sound after 10 days.The replacement period is not long enough.so i took it to the philips service centre they said that the woofer needs to be replaced but there is no stock with them damn!!!!. I have to wait till the end of this month.
So philips please check your products correctly before you release them into the market.",5
"It is an awesome product at this range. At first i received a defective product,and I got it replaced. Now this one is working fine. Good bass, good treble, classic looks. Friends, you can go for this product without any hesitation. Make sure after you receive the product, you get your device registered on Philips family which can be done online. Thanks.",5
"Even though in medium volume the woofer makes Humming noise which causes much disturbance.
There is no display to show the level if volume, bass etc.
Plz it Should be provided in next series.
All other features are good except woofer.",2
Sound quality poor .. Am not satisfied this product ..,1
"Bass and terrible controller is its default.
Sound is also not good.
It is best for those who wants more bass.",5
"One Speak poor quality, it has daunt...",1
"MY EXPERIENCE IS VERY BAD FOR AMAZON. I WANT TO EXCHANGE THIS PRODUCT BUT AMAZON'S EXECUTIVE SAYS THIS IS UNDER OF ELECTRONIC T&C WE ARE NOT EXCHANGE THIS PRODUCT
AND THIS PRODUCT VERY 4TH CLASS SOUND AND QUALITY",1
Great product sound quality is great everything is fine... and delivery was to earlier i was not expecting thisüòÖüòÖ,5
"I bought this on 2nd June, it worked fine till date. Now it has been started creating problem on bluetooth. I am not sure whether it is covered under warranty",1
I like so much,5
"Worst service don't buy this Philips device.
Honestly this product is amazing but I won't recommend this you to buy because Phillips worst service. It's been 3 months I purchased this product and worked very well and recently it stopped working thus it's not switching on. I contacted Philips customer service representative and they filed a complaint and they said that they will send a technician to solve this problem but I didn't get a call from them since I complained about the issue.
Now it's been 3 days but they didn't reach me regarding the issue.",1
Can say that the product is OK. But didn't meet my expectation. I was using the Creative sound system which bought in 2006 and it was working fine till last month. The fluctuation in electricity killed my sound system. Hence I thought to buy one to replace my old one. But the sound quality can't compare with my old Creative sound system. Philips made me disappointed.,4
"Sound quality aswam..
Bass quality jast wow..
Nice product i'm happy..",5
"Sound Quality, Bass is adequate for room upto12*12, anyways it's a budget mm speaker.
Experienced bt connectivity issues, It doesn't get connected even if device is alredy added to cellphone/ laptop. I had to search device everytime I turn it on and add it to the cellphone/ laptop.
Sometimes it gets disconnected if you pause music or video for just 5-10 seconds..
then you have to reconnect manually / re-pair n resume where u left, this was something I felt annoying..
If this is the issue with all units, Brand like Philips need to adress such issues since most of the people use bt connectivity nowadays than any other means.
Build quality is good for the price, except remote seems very poor quality and doesn't work sometime. Battery not provided * customer satisfaction is more than the cost of batteries I guess.
But Thanks to Amazon's best customer service / support solved my issue immediately.",3
Good product worth the price....,5
"Pros -
Great build quality
Sound is clear and crisp.
Good Sound Volume
Doesn't Distort at high volume
Treble is balanced

Cons-
Bluetooth range is terrible. Just 3-4m.
Doesn't have good base. And there's no tuning knob for it like older versions used to have.",4
"Noise like hissing sound is coming when there is no audio is present.
after using two months this Noise is unbearable and complained to Phillips Customer Care . Nothing has happened till date they are saying they will replace the unit but it almost one month is over.
switched over to my old Home theater system.
So please think twice before going for this product.",1
"The product is work investing.

Remote control has bass control
Blutooth connectivity is awesome.. even if you keep your phone in another room it catches
product design is very good
sound clarity is very good",5
The sound is very muddy. I was expecting better sound. The product was faulty when arrived so had to return it once. Not great value for money. It's a Made in China rebranded product. Instead of this buy B&H or Creative or something else. Philips is ripping money off just because of brand name,3
"First of thanks to AMAZON to deliver in lockdown situation n in such a good conditionüëçüëç

Philips surprised me with the punchy bass, loud n crystal clear sound
I like this system because of the all type of connectivity it provides.",5
"Sound quality is good with plenty of bass. However not as loud as I wanted for small parties at home or in open.

Update after 4 months of usage:
I was wrong to say speakers are not loud. I used it outdoors in a party of around 50 people and i never felt speakers are not loud.",5
"i bought for Rs 4039, it has good bass 6000 pmpo",4
"Design and looks deserve appreciation‚Ä¶ audio quality is fine, loud enough but lacks balance between bass and treble‚Ä¶ default settings has a clear vocal and bass but unfortunately you CANT ADJUST TREBLE‚Ä¶ and treble is suppressed a lot probably to highlight the vocals‚Ä¶ hence the songs lacks sweetness‚Ä¶hope users of these speakers also have experienced the same‚Ä¶the much popular ""V"" shaped custom equaliser profile gives a buzzing sound of bass. FM clarity is praiseworthy‚Ä¶ the grills of convertible speakers are delicate enough to catch dents easily‚Ä¶",4
"The Speakers only look impressive but perform very average.
Only good thing about these speakers is their Bass but it overpowers all other tones and end up sounding like any roadside boom-boom system!
Remote stopped performing after 2-3 months of usage.
Bluetooth: Felt like its generation 1 of blue-tooth connectivity feature, keeps disconnecting every now & then
I ended up using it as a FM player alone but it disappointed me here too... the FM station either changes on its own or simply disconnects itself!
In summary: Don't fall for the brand name Philips , it performs really bad!",3
"Philips is a very big company but local retailers are destroying company name.
I found today Philips MMS2220B 2.1 convertible multimedia soundbar/speaker's
But it is not starting. No power coming.
I have lodge a replacement order.",1
"Received the product before time without any damages. The sound quality is really great, the bass is super good at 6,199/-.

Edited on 16 March 21: The seller returned me 200 bucks as it got cheaper during the sale after my purchase, thanks to Aperio Retail. unfortunately, the USB port was faulty, upon complaining, Philips customer care resolved the issue by replacing the chipset with a new one within 2 days. Thanks for such a good service.

**Please stop blaming the brand or sellers if you all can't handle your stuff properly.",5
"Good product. Heavy bass.
You'll not notice Bluetooth connected.
USB will start from first song always
Humming noise from speaker when you just keep it on.. and not playing..",3
"The sound quality is crystal clear. The Philips 6080b sound system offers more than I paid for it. I was undecided among Panasonic SC HT30GW-K, Infinity Hardrock 210, and Philips 6080b. As I have already owned Phillips, Infinity (speakers), and Panasonic sound systems in the past, I knew that none of them will disappoint me. However the Infinity 210 got eliminated in my research as it offered the least features than the other two and had very inconsistent customer reviews. I preferred the Panasonic HT30GW as it offers a very unique simple design and more power (80watts), but unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt have the Bass control. One thing I observed in the customer reviews of the Philips 6089b that many customers mentioned the experience of ‚Äúcrystal clear‚Äù sound produced by it in this price range which turned out to be true. Of course it will be very unfair to compare it to the more expensive sound systems.

The design of this unit turned out to be really nice. It is very shiny but not in a cheap way. Its shine hides the physical controls on the system, making them stealth and cool.

It also remembers the sound volume and bass control setting number if you switch it off. The remote it comes with it is cheap and just okay, but I really don‚Äôt need it much. One more important thing, in the case you lose your remote or damage it, you can still turn the system on/off with the physical play button on the system itself by holding it for 2-3 seconds. Only thing I haven‚Äôt figured out is how to control the base setting if the remote gets damaged as there is no base knob on the system, perhaps a universal remote can work.

Tips - Read the user manual which comes with it for the proper placement of the 2.1 sound system. I also bought a small voltage stabilizer to use with it from my local shop because in my area voltage fluctuates a lot in summer. A voltage stabilizer can protect it from getting short circuited and also helps to maintain the sound volumes consistent. Make sure to adjust the volume of your phone/tablet/laptop if you listen the audio with the Bluetooth of your device otherwise you might think the Philips 6080b isn‚Äôt loud enough.",5
"This is a good 2.1 multi media speaker.
Pro:
1. Bass effect is very good.
2. It's very loud.
3. Vocal clarity is good.
4. Bluetooth works great.
5. Remot control works fine but philips could have given the treble control too. It irritates you a lot which I have mentioned in cons section.
Cons:
1. Wire length is very short. If you place the speakers close to woofer with wire length provided, you won't get the stereo effect.
2. Woofer effect is very high compared to speakers which degrades the listening quality . It gives you headache if you listen for a long time.
3. Treble is a headache here. It sometimes works excessively . This is the the main cons for me.

Over all this is for those persons who like loudness and high treble. It is a good product with good clarity. I gave it 3 star because of excessive woofer effect and treble effect which spoils my listening experience otherwise I would have rated it 5 .
I hope philips will fix these problems with upcoming models. Please Philips fix these problems . Still you have a lot of loyal customers in India.
I hope this helps .",4
"Did not expect such quality. Amazing. Very Recommended.

In Some reviews, People were saying Display was necessary to see if volume high or low etc. For me i this it is not required just because, whenever you pres any key on remote, the LED light on the woofer blinks if it is changing. In other words, if you keep on pressing volume button low, it will blink till the volume drops to the lowest level and after that it stops blinking. Same goes with Bass as well.

Quality is superb and voice is clean.",5
"This is an amazing speaker system. It has a lot of options, starting from USB, SD Card, AUX, CD and Bluetooth so that you can play music from your smartphone or laptop or connect it to your TV system while watching a movie.

Sound is so crisp, no jarring effect.",5
"PROS
- Good or worth Sound Quality which wont dissapoint you
- Good Bass with Bass controller and without much distortion at top levels
- Avg Sound Clarity which is worth this price
- Good Looking
- Subwoofer build quality is good with nice design

CONS
- A low humming sound just when idle even when nothing is playing
- Speaker build quality is not upto the expectations and stand provided is not much stable. Using as a sound bar is much more better.
- Though speakera have lengths and seems to have 2 drivers, it actually have single driver and rest is empty space. Just lengthy speakers for looks only

Overall product is good at this range and much better than some alternatives",4
"In this price, this is a beautiful deal. I bought it for Rs.6499 on 12th Jan 2021 and got it delivered today.

Forget all those speakers which claim to give you an output of more than 40RMS ... they all have distorted bass. My written words cannot describe the beauty of those speakers. Epic sound quality (high rich audio that your windows will crack), rich bass that is not for the faint hearted (controllable), crystal clear output, amazing source compatibility and awesome bluetooth range of 10 meters ... just a dream come true in this price.

I just love this system and you would too when it comes to you and you have to see it to believe it!!!",5
Average product.... poor quality package.... product has got damages on the way... bluetooth connectivity stopped working within 2 months.. Remote poor quality which is no more alive in 4 months,1
Excellent product this is so fantastic product.,5
"After my beloved philips fw-335 died due mains fluctuation, i wanted to buy a musical sounding system.After researching found out that todays speaker systems are not upto the mark or sound as balanced as older systems made during 1990s or early 2000.my predictions were that philips would still have maintained their signature sound to some extent.And i was not wrong,after listening to the system i felt as follows:(i am being very strict and comparing it to my reference system philips fw-335 which had a high end sound with high end price tag back then).
Pros:
-bass is really good/musical.i.e. you can divide bass into two section i.e low end and upper bass (100hz).This system manages both in a balanced manner i.e. in order to enjoy music your 100hz should be well boosted.bass notes are well defined i.e lower and upper bass are well separated.
-midrange and high frequencies are good.If you compare with competition its better.But if you compare it to my reference fw-335 system it lacks the soundstage,depth or 3d holographic effect potrayed by fw-335.
-i think no other manufacturer can tune sound the way philips has done even from chinese ics and passive components.chinese components cannot match brands like elna,rubycon,jrc,toshiba,matsushita,philips's own ics and passive components(carbon film resistors and mkt capacitors),wolfson,mitsubishi,sanyo,panasonic.
-after listening to the bass performance,i was instantly reminded of jrc 4558,guess what i opened the system out of curiosity and voila! i found two jrc 4558 in preamp.(the reason for good bass.)
cons:
cons are not in comparison to the competition,but in comparison to my reference fw-335.
mid intruments such as snare drums should have more space.mid bass should be improved(lack of mid bass is a common disadvantage of 3 inch full range drivers).
conclusion:
The conclusion para consists of my experience about today's bad phase in audio electronics.with ban on chinese electronics,and make in india initiative,its time philips starts manufacturing its speaker drivers from past i.e the legendary hi-q international full range drivers,balanced frequency responce woofer/mid bass drivers that they used in power house system,aw series and early fw series.I request philips to bring back their legendary signature sound from 1990's.i think with todays automation and lower labour cost its possible to bring back the old signature sound of philips even at 3x or 4x the cost of this system.we would still pay 3x ,4x more price than todays systems just for the balanced musical sound that the philips music systems had during 1990's.This is definitely achievable if philips takes our feedback seriously.If philips does this they can blow the competitors out of competition.",5
"Writing this review after usage of 10 months. Sound wise its good. The problem arose with the speaker ports for AUX i.e. to take input from other devices like Mobile, TV etc. In my case, it is LED TV and it was working Okay for 10 months but a huge disturbing noise started coming now which I tried resolving by replacing the AUX wire but no luck. Although the product comes under warranty but no idea how Philips post buying experience would be.",2
"The sound is good, so is the look and the performance. Was just curious to know who puts the subwoofer at the bottom of the speaker? I mean who is the designer? Also it has facility to hang the 2 tower speakers on the wall but the main speaker cannot be hanged.... I mean seriously..",4
"This is best in sound at this price. Only disappointment is, controlling bass option is only in remote. It should have also provided on woofer. What if remote is gone bad?
Apart from this, its a very good product. Dont go for other -ve reviews about sound etc., Just go for it.",4
"You pay only for the brand. The output is not upto the mark. I was using creative sbs. So i feel a bit let down on the quality of audio. It is also not loud enough. Bluetooth remembers only one connected device. You have to pair everytime you connect it to a diff device. After connecting to another device, you have to pair once again to connect to previous device. FM radio receiver is not good. Even with antenna there is noise in reception.",2
"Fake description about product in Amazon about size of sound box and power output of subwoofer. Sound is not up to the expectations from Philips, reliance reconnect sound system is much better stability at Max sound rather than philips at Same price segment. I purchased this item after seeing several reviews, so I must that a person giving their reviews must have some knowledge to identify real sounds and actual outputs of sound boxes. There is diffence in booming sound and loudness, this product is for loudness not for booming.sound is limited to room only not outside of room.",3
"1. It is a good product.
2. Heavy Bass.
3. It is not a premium product.
4. However for the cost, it is good.
5. Bluetoooth connectivity is nice.
6. The speakers need a grill to avoid physical damage.
7. Nice design.",4
"Sound is superb and crisp. Bass is terrible and adjustable. Was very happy, since i could easily connect my Smart TV with this MMS6080B, through bluetooth and was thrilling to watch English movies with great sound. Could connect and pair all the devices very fast. Can listen to FM, songs from the mobile, attach USB and so on. Very good for music lovers that too at a lower price.",5
"Negative: I have purchased and returned this product for not working one of the speakers, so I got replacement for it. After replacement also I got the defect product (plugin bent)
Positive: Sound and bass are good",2
"I have been using this system for around 2 weeks now.
Delivered in good condition and on time as promised, but unit seems to be old ..of July 2019.
Sound Quality is good, satisfactory performance in this price range. No Eqillizer options available in BT/ Aux mode. Not a big problem default settings works fine with songs/ Movies/ games etc..well we can control bass in any mode.
Build quality is also good, even satellites have wooden body with nice fit n finish, however I personally did not like glossy finish on the front panels. I would prefer matt black finish..well it's subjective matter anyways.
On other hand Remote seems to be of cheap quality and doesn't even work effectively.
Batteries are not provided in the box.by Philips*
Other disappointing thing I felt is.. wire length for satellite, too short to set up properly.
Bluetooth/ Aux connectivity is good no issues at all.
Overall it's good value for money product, you may certainly consider this.
Thanks !",4
"Not happy with the product. I returned it because there was a constant hum from the subwoofer when there is was no input sound. For instance if you are listening to a playlist and here is a moments silence between songs you can hear the hum. Or if you pause play, then too you will hear it. It disappears at 0 volume, but comes back at the first increment in volume. When I noticed it the first time, it thought it was a defective piece and got it replaced. But the replaced piece also had the same issue, so got a refund. Full marks to Amazon for doing it promptly. Other customers have commented on the same issue, but I didn‚Äôt really read all the reviews before deciding to buy it. If I had, I wouldn‚Äôt have bought it. Lesson learnt....always read customer reviews before deciding to buy. Philips should seriously look into this issue and fix it as it‚Äôs damaging to their good name. Now I will be hesitant to buy a Philips audio product in future unless I am sure I could get a full refund if not satisfied.",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I ordered this for my friend's wedding. 9 people contributed and bought it and all were watching when my friend unboxed it, but it became a very embarrassing moment when the woofer did not power on. We tried to switch it in different plugs but the power on Led did not blink. I have 6080b model and 9120b tower speakers in my home buy this was extremely dissappointing and this did not happen with those. Khair....the customer care got it replaced and the second one worked just fine. The FM reception is very low for a speaker of this size and cost. But you would love it when connected to a Led tv or via bluetooth. I have given one star less due to Appario's carelessness.",4
Seems the retailer is fraud as he has given some refurbished product in which the remote does not work. All the stickers was removed and hand prints and dust on the woofers and speakers. Worst packing which can lead to product damage. Amazon should black list these kind of retailers which brings down Amazon brand value. One of the speakers also have some noise while playing song.,1
"Though it works well, The sound quality I am not fully ok. I bought for less boss and very milk sound but here every time you need to adjust the boss to have quality sound. Overall OK product.
it is not working properly now. spurious product. suddenly while listening music it is getting silenced. IN any mode, auxiliary, blue tooth, fm, or usb. Pl tell me what to do? is it replacement possible or what to do please answer. It is china made philips product which is spurious. if you happened to read this please tell me or call me 9940153667 wit solution if possible. But here afterwards please tell us if it is chinese product we will avoid buying it through amazon. I feel my money got wasted if I would have bought in show room I would have checked and bought where it is manufactured. PL HELP",1
"No Doubt, Philips product is really good. But if i have to say about the Packing of the product, its Pathetic. I received the Product with one leg broken for the sub woofer. I tried for replacement, but the seller does not have a stock currently. Thus, only option is to take a refund, as Amazon only replace the product if the same seller has the stock available. They cannot replace from a different seller. This is a catch and a learning for me as a loyal customer, to not trust the 10 days replacement policy.
Recommendations will be, buy the product form a offline store as the product is good and a good experience with 2.1 Channel speakers but do not trust the packaging of the online shopping websites.",4
Suddenly stop working after 1-2 hrs of playback..it happens 2 time.... I wish I can buy 1 more time bcoz of sound is awesome...bass is very hard...but I don't bcoz if the product fails 2 times in 1-2 hrs. Of playback than what should happen after return window close ..we need to rush on Phillips customer care...,1
Product is worthless. Sound quality is zero. It's loud than clear. Can only enjoy in case want volume up to 25 percent after that woffer start shaking and voice looks to be fake and suppressed. Waste of money,1
If you wann buy mini DJ for your house and is your hall is big . Just close your eye and buy this product I have used around 10 sound system till now but this one is one of best. I have ever used and that undar 6500 rs and please make sure this is best for house not for Open place like shop or something like that and also if you gonna use it like every day around 5 to 6 hours it might give you little bit low sound but your family guy and buying for morning artis and weekend movies and party's at house just go for it 100% this product is perfect for it I am using this product from last 1year and friend of mine who suggested me to buy this product he is using it from 3 years. And this is true from my side .,4
"Good product by philips , sound quality is also good, bass is really ground shaking..
But produces some humming sound if the bass is increased on Bluetooth connectivity..

But recommend you to not purchase from the seller Appario.. as it provides me damaged product 2 times after then I got the right product..

Overall best product by Philips.. worth price and design is also good.",5
"Superb in sound & built quality nice, but only problem with USB, its sudden getting stopped after 3-4 songs, v have to re-start for smooth play by doing power on off, Bluetooth working superbly, exterior body excellent. & Over all Amazon maintained excellent package quality n in time delivery.",3
"Writing it on my 2nd of purchasing it. Sound quality is awesome gives real feel,, I can't play it on full volume in my 2 bhk flat as neighbour can't hear their TV volume then.
I received the product with little damage, 1 long scratch on 1 sound bar and 1 minor dent on second sound bar. But I was expecting it because I had gone through the reviews so it was not a big disappointment for me. 1 brownie point for me is that fm was working awesome as most ppl said in review that fm doesn't work properly but it's awesome in my case .
I feel that the size of subwoofer and bar is unnecessary big. when I first time holded it in my hand it left paint mark on my hand and considering dent I would say that build quality is not that good. I bought it for 7k and am satisfied.",4
"Its a nice speaker system but do not have high expectation. At this price range you will get more options. I heard low end Philips multimedia speakers and the quality/loudness of the speaker was awesome. So that was the reason i was expecting much more at this price range. For 15x15 room its sufficient.

P.S. : Radio is worthless. No signal in-fact after setting proper antenna wire.",3
I bought this product on Jan 3rd. The sound was amazing. But last week suddenly it stopped working and smoke came from inside the sub woofer system and the whole board have been burned out. I registered it in Philips service centre and they called me within 6 hours and they told to bring it to the near by town which is situated nearly about 40 kms. They tested and told that whole board has been burned out it will take one week to service the system. We have the doubt that the product is original or not.,1
I bought this product a month ago from Amazon . while you continous listen music for one hour it won't works.only woofer works and speaker will not work.,2
"Sound quality is ok(No mains distortion),
Uses a 5bit gain control,
Bluetooth connectivity is better than other brands,
FM needs an antenna extension,
Sleep power is less,
If using Aux input, use better jack than provided.
There is no earthing lead for this system(would have appreciated more).
Inbuilt preconfigured equalizer is helpful when listening to lectures vs music vs movie(manual equalizer tuning would have been nice for advanced users).
No batteries are provided for the remote from factory.",5
"Great product, 1st received with one left speaker not working but got replaced in 2 days time with great Amazon service... 2nd received with bad package quality but product completely fine and as shown and mentioned!! Sound quality good once tuned as per the output source requirement and plays well... would had been better with HDMI connection ... but really a value for money product...",4
Love the product. Great sound. Quite loud. The bass effect is superb. Price quite reasonable.,5
"Only disappointing thing is no brace/net cover/ rat protection for bass. It is located below the woofer cabinet pointing ground. Phillips can add a small screen on woofer for some basic info.
Bass and music outcome is great. A very good music system for a room.",3
"Bad quality product
Amazon also a bad seller
They doesnt exchange this product which have no quality of sound..
They think we select there product through an image.. which is note possible",1
"Extremely poor built quality. Material used are extremely cheap. Down facing bass speakers are susceptible to damage as it is without any protective cover. satellite speaker is extremely small and does not have sufficient punch.
Philips would loose its reputation by selling cheap re branded Chinese products",1
"When I purchased them, I was quite confused that how will they perform when they'll meet my desires. Then the order arrived and as I opened them I just wonder to it's material quality that I'll become a fan of it. And after that when it comes to fulfill my desires, I swear it fulfills it and give me alot enjoyment whenever I play them. I feel wonder whenever I play them. Thanks to Phillips.",5
"Arrived on time with proper packaging and in a spic and span condition. All functions are working satisfactorily.

Good sound quality with good bass. However, music lovers would miss mids and treble control. Also, cables for satellite speakers are very short.

All in all its an excellent purchase at this price range. I would recommend this product to all those who need a branded but a budget 2.1 home theater system.",5
Great product but I got a defective piece. I started hearing s loud buzzing sound when I switched it on after 3-4 months. I took it to the svx CTR at himayatnagar and they said nothing was wrong. The sound stopped for 2 months and started again intermittently. Most recently I got a burning smell when using it and switched it off. It hasn't worked at all since. I would not suggest this product even though I like Philips.,3
Nice,5
"I have received the product on time but it makes me surprise after using it. I have connected through the Bluetooth and played songs, the out put the subwoofer really makes me feel lime some local quality. The subwoofer bas is constant and through the unbearable bass sound not on the smoother way. I think this product not belongs to Philips, Believing Amazon we order products but the seller sell the local made product by the name of brand. Please stop making fool to the customers.",1
"I have recived a damaged product.
it was already opened one.
the sound was not coming.
and I got a replacement for the same.
it is working good.
good build quality. good soundnight and bass.
FM also working good.
remote control is also good.
more options to connect.
just value for the money.
dont thinkforget, jst buy.!",5
"I have researched for more than 3 months while buying Philips MMS8085B. I purchased this in 6200 bucks and believe this is one of the best speakers in this range. I also checked the Boat soundbars which are in this range, but Philips has a edge over all those soundbars and speakers. At first it comes with classy look that attracts anybody attention towards it. Second the Sound quality is awesome. I have connected it with my TV using bluetooth and it performs awesome. Base quality is also very good. You can change the base as per your requirement. However the remote buildup quality is very poor.",5
Received damaged one sound baar very disappointed .. and box is also break,1
"Remote lacks feedback,
Speakers Bluetooth is fine but EQ is really bad,
Unnecessary base going out, barely any quality in sound, design is OK, as advertised its is completely opposite of it, didn't expected for a 60rms power speaker that too from Philips,
Sound is distorted not good after 15 volume out of 30, don't buy it, I am sending it for return.",2
"The sound quality of provided Satellite speakers is not good. Bass unit is decent.
I have old Panasonic bookshelf speakers which I hooked up instead of Philips satellite speakers.
Now the sound quality is simply Superb.
Philips needs to give better quality Satellite speakers.
Otherwise a pretty decent system.",4
"Excellent 1 day delivery via normal check out. The sound quality can only be ""listen it to believe it"". Awesome product for the price. Connects to bluetooth device in seconds, FM works like magic, USB mode is very good as you get to play around with the equalizer present in the remote. All in all a great product at such price.",5
Stopped working suddenly after 2-3 days moreover one of the speaker were damaged ( crack in the plastic body),1
"It became not operative After six days working.It might be into power ckt fault.it maybe due to defective piece or detail route cause analysis is required at manufacturing end for avoid the repeatiation at any customer.
By luck it was under return time limit.hence I go for replacement on the name of PHILIPS because for good quality.Unfortuantely my piece became defective after five days of working",5
Its just Ok. The remote is not having treble control and only Bass control. If the bass is increased the speaker flutters . The sharpness in sound is less and can not be increased.,4
"The system does more than justice for the price. Overall, a fantastic buy- Gr88 product from Philips. The sub woofer is extremely powerful even though rms is only 60W. Speakers provide crystal clear sound at all volume levels. When i tried to play in excess of 20 level of volume my entire PC table, sliding windows & even iron grills started to vibrate. Tremendous power in such a small system. Overall an excellent buy.",5
"Bass is completely waste. You will not hear the beats with this speaker. Just the bass guitar's sound alone will come from the amplifier. No drum beats or the thabala bass will be heared. Overall rating is 3. Go for some other brands in this price range. Even the intex 2.1 small speakers gives a great sound compared to this speaker. In addition to that, you will hear a constant buzzing sound.....",2
"Philips 6080b blue tooth home theatre system,a fantastic gadget to play music through mobile phone, USB, FM radio, memory card. Very nice sound with sufficient bass(controlled by remote) and I am using it with my LED TV. Beautiful sound quality, good remote control and a vfm product, highly recommend.I bought it in BBD with huge discount.",5
"Received a dead item. Doesn't turn on, no blinking lights or nothing. Besides the speakers look really cheap and there is no 3.5 Input for the convertible satellite speakers. Absolutely pathetic product and service. J would have returned anyway.",1
"I bought these with a hesitated mind about the quality of sound it would produce, but to my surprise the speakers didn't disappoint me. They have a great balance of sound even on higher / lower notes, doesn't vibrate and the crystal clear sound is heard. Very much suitable for in-house parties. Connects to Bluetooth efficiently and a very handy remote to control specially the base separately. Can be recommended.",5
"Packing of the product is very poor.
Don't buy this product. I m not happy with philips brand.

Waste of money.",1
Beautiful home thyater. Both bass and treble are good. Looking is also beautiful.Unbeatable sound quality.,5
"One side speaker was not worked, So i returned the product",2
"sound is superb , woofer satisfies the beats ,amazon delivered the product on time as Usual . I am so happy with this deal only u will miss the display it helps too much while listening means u don‚Äôt understand the volume level and bass level and also the right speaker bar got a little dent which is easily been see if u see it closely otherwise it worth Buying. My request to amazon please increase your package quality so that the product will delivere Safely",5
Superb performance,5
"Very good product under 3000 rupees. Bass is good. A bit problematic while connecting with bluetooth, else everything is fine. Early delivery by Amazon. Philips is always trustworthy for me. Received with no damage. Go for it if you need a sound system for your room in low budget.",5
"I love the sound quality and it's overall performance is better then I expected..but what I don't like that is.. First, I received the defective product with sound defect. There were no sound at all. Then I got the replaced one which has special design on the sound bar check the pic. Overall delivery process took approx 10 days. Which wasn't expected. I was planning to buy appliances here but drroped that idea. I don't know whose to be blaimed the Facility or the relailer or the courier. That sucks.",4
1st product came defected. Exchange was carried out by Amazon very fast. 2nd product gave up in 20 days..it's completely dead now. I guess Amazon is selling refurbished product in name of new product. Guys please be careful at discount rates offered by Amazon. They distribute defected product in sales and later on you face problem.,1
After purchasing this I thout better if I go with boat 120w system .. above of this is volume controller not cd case .. over all this product also ok ok,3
"I bought the speaker and return it next day my smart TV doesn't have old line in connectivity option.
The speaker has lack of connectivity option Phillips should consider to provide atleast optical out all the smart TV equipped with the hdmi and optical out.
The groove of the speaker dominate the quality of the sound if your bedroom and living room big in size then only you should consider else you won't enjoy the music.",3
"Sound quality , Build quality, and the connectivities are really good. But remote control won't work if I am trying to control in different direction. FM also little lacking (but that's the common issue for these type of speaker system)

Regarding the delivery - it was fast, but one side of the package got completely wet due to rain. So I must say packing is not up to the mark.",5
"the sound quality was average.
the product stopped working after a few days (3-4 days). it does not power up anymore. asked for replacement as it is still under replacement window.

Praying that the replaced system should not end up in the same state.",1
"Received a damaged product.
This model is perfect but unfortunately i received a defective item.",1
Sound quality is very good...but received in damaged condition...,4
"I don't know what to say about these speakers
I thought my tv speakers will give me better sound but this is the best pair of speakers. Use this for watching tv shows and movies. Amazing clarity with clear and detailed sound. Buy thing",5
"Sound quality is very good, you can increase decrease Bass. But the bluetooth keeps on disconnecting. One of the speaker also does not work at times, so I have to restart the speakers to connect bluetooth and make all speakers work. Not raising a complain because of Corona, but expected better quality from Phillips.",2
Bought in July 2018 and now in Sept 19 it has got issues. Initially its hard keys stopped responding properly. Now System has stopped working. It is just out of warrantee. Dont know what to do,1
sound quality is good and Bluetooth get connected fast. Writing review after 1 week. But can't control treble except volume and bass. Overall nice sound and in this budget very nice music system.,5
Actually I have already one Philips home theater in my house which I had purchased 3yrs back costing around 15000‚Çπ but recently purchased this pdt for gift to my Dad which is very nice pdt.good quality sound basically his bass which is Awesome .I am very much thanks to Amazon who kept this quality PDT for sale.thanks,5
Durability of product. I am using it from last 2 years and now started facing the problem as one of its speaker input socket is not working. I think its too early to have such problems from such a renowned brand. Sound quality is ok not superb. But in 5k we expect nore than this.,3
Main speaker box speaker was not safe position any damage was come some time no guard was provided. Not like this .,2
I was shocked when i heard them. They sound like roadside Chinese boombox with nothing but bass in them. If you are really low on budget then get F&D (fenda) but if your budget is anything above 5k then just do yourself a favor and get EDIFIER. Any edifier bookshelf speakers in your budget- (they have a huge range). thank me later!!,1
"The speaker is good but when it was delivered the product was some damaged . Then I call the boy who delivered the speaker then he told me No refund by cash. Only through bank account and. Amazon pay ! If any
one Don't have bank account or Amazon. Pay How they will get refund?............................................this is the question to Amazon",5
"Excellent and decent sound quality, especially for a home with NORMAL bass and sound, And not for Rock and heavy. Thank Philips and one more thank to the Amazon, Vendor.",4
"Woofer box is very large and shape is also odd, thia make it difficult to fit in a corner and lookas odd one out.
Soumd is ok not what you expect.
This is made in china to plastic quality is also not so good.",3
"Actually, product is really good, of course.. Philips is awesome brand. But the delivery was so Unexpectable. Remote control, warranty card bill was missing... I received unpacked box... I really disappointed... Pls Amazon make sure that the delivery service must be good.",3
Not even worth for single star also first I received a detective product after running for 10 mins it has stopped working again the replacement I have got is a damaged one the leg of subwoofer was broken and dents in the subwoofer,1
"Reviewing after almost 1 year of use it is very nice speaker for birthday parties, anniversary parties, new year's party at home or terrace. Very nice product must buy.",5
Bass control not given in remote. Treble is very high even if you put it at very lower level. Sound quality is good but kot up to the expectations. Go for Sony instead if you can spend 2000 more.,2
Received a damaged product. One of the lower edges is smashed slightly and I had not noticed it. Bass is not working. Unfortunately I had gifted the product and the defrcts were noticed aftef the return window was closed.,3
"Thanks to amazon for delivering within 24 hours..and coming to product it has reached my expectations in all aspects i would recommend to go for this one without second thought i got it at 5800 rs in offer.CONs are
No LED display to track song name ..and missing automated Bass and sound adjustments..",5
Bass is amazing . No issues with Bluetooth connectivity . It's so loud even in 20 percent volume . Great for parties and you would love to use it somewhere not surrounded by irritating neighbours.,5
"Great sound bluetooth and works perfectly with my home theater system the sound quality is good and output is also loud and with woofer you get one subwoofer at the bottom of the main tower that delivers great cinematic experience rich bass
Absolutely loved this product",5
Dissatisfied with sound output,1
"It's amazing speakers. Can use as a bar as well as towers like a monolithic dropped at your home.
But after 6 months, the sound is not that good, lot of not needed bass noise, no clue on warranty or if I can get it replaced since it's in warranty still.
Amazon please help if you reading this and if the customer reviews matter for you!
#hopingHelp",3
"I have used this in my Bedroom and it's been amazing. Excellent Bass and clear sound. You may find it difficult to adjust the bass and balance initially but as you keep using it you will find the right balance. Point to not is that it does not sync well with some of the players on your mobile when you connect through Bluetooth, I had issues with Poweramp and when I used another player it worked pretty well.",5
"Giving three star because woofer is very small , and wrong information shared by the seller about weight as actual weight is 5.1 Kg I stead on 8.9 kg , overall sound quality is good and you can buy this device.",3
"Bass quality is awesome but the sub speaker's clarity sucks at mid tone, it is not up to the mark, not so sharp and powerful sound.

This 2.1 is not for rock or metal music but you can enjoy melody or soft music very well.

Price is little bit high than performance.",3
"Its average. Not up to the mark like it's name.
Sometimes bluetooth and FM not working, I mean Bluetooth and FM is below average.
Sound is like, ppl of 80's would like it.
Not for youth.
In this budget any local brand would be better than this.",2
"I bought it from Amazon and it was delivered on time. The product is worth it's price. However, a clear and descriptive booklet for guding on how to save radio channels should have been provided with the product.",5
"Servicing and responseto the customers at philips service centers is tooworst. Don't purchase philips products. We have loggedthe complaint before warranty period and service centre kept with them without repairing two months and finally tellingthe warranty has expired. No proper response and respect to the customers fromtheirseniors also.

So don't purchase philips items",1
Sound clarity is very good. Awesome for music as well as movies. I am no audiophile but I feel that bass is just right in this system.,5
"I am very very happy
Sound quality super
Sheerness super
Value for money",5
"Product is good. It is Philips, that name itself satisfy us. Since 15 years I have a Philips Music system, 3VCD changer, bought before DVD invention, which is now giving problems, hence I purchased again Philips product.
Seller: I am very much impressed by seller Appario. Sent the product in good packing. Before said time delivery.",5
"productis ok , good sound performance, but sub speaker cabel is too short..Though using at distance for sub speaker is not possible . And one sub speaker is producing ssssss noise, F&D brand is good",2
I am disappointed because this is my first order from amazon & the left speaker is dead.Sound quality is okay.The replacement TAT is again 4 days which sounds miserable.I think flipcart is a better option since I haven't received any faulty products as of now.,3
"Overall its a good experience.

But the 3mm jack that was connected to our LED TV, creates background noise. Jack connectivity is of bad quality.

Other connectivity like Bluetooth and USB works as expected.",3
Today i recieved this product....Its awsome for bass lovers....and sound quality is also good but not too much.... baaki toh kuch din chaLa ke pata chalega,4
"Product has everything is perfect as Phillips brand

The sound quality is not pure it's just given a homing sound when it's on ideal mode .not good it's a delhi made HT SYSTEM .I am not satisfied with the performance,3
Has no bass control nor is its bass that great. FM did not work for me as the speakees were kept 10 feet inside the room from window.,3
Good one for living room. Bass and other equaliser setting need to improve. Bluetooth works nicely. FM RADIO woks good even low signle intensity. Power cabel is too short. Auto search for FM radio button should be different on remote control.,3
"Good Bass Quality,
but the wires for speakers are small.. Product should have had volume control and bass control button on the woofer itself hence i gave 4 starts for this product.
Received it today only from Amazon...
Thanks for fast delievery prime amazon..Nice service from Amazon...üòä
Anyways product is nice.",4
"nothing special about voice, pretty much average sound quality, only thing is its bass deepness when put volume somewhere around 15 and bass adjusted at 10 or more, one think i am sure that sound of bass from woofer will not break on high note",4
Phillips must seriously consider updagrading its products with optical output & HDMI connectivity for clarity of sound. Remote control not upto the mark but acceptable as it is working fine. Bluetooth connectivity is excellent. Sound quality is soothing & lovly. Overall extremely happy with the product. Dont think twice coz it is a much better than Sony in the same range.,5
Its decent for the price. Bass is too high.,4
"SOUND - CLEAR AND LOUD

Good quality of sound,5
Product is fine for the cost spent. But package and delivery is bad experience. Package has been covered with transparent and tape. Cart box is broken it reveals that delivery is not handled properly.,3

It is not working and supplied used item which was rejected by someone. original packing and labels are tampered. replacement request raised. expecting at least this they will supply brand new product (not unpacked/rejected item).,1
"Speaker has a great low end bass which can make u sleep . Richer sound quality. Great package to buy . Overall good .
But once you start increasing the volume speaker and bass gets worse. Not good for big area.

But one of the speaker is little bit bent.",5
The sound quality is amazing. And now after 3 months its is subwoofer stopped working. I used it daily for 1 hour at 10% volume. suddenly it turned off and now it is not turning on. According to me don't buy it. Go for something more branded.,1

I am reviewing after 1 week.. Sound quality is super.. Bass is more high than i expected.. Remote control is awesome.. Totally this product is amazing.. They delivered in date.. Only one disadvantage there is no display thats why i gave 4 stars.. Except that i would like to give 5 stars,4
"Output is really amazing. It has option to control the amount of bass you want to listen to. Radio reception is also good. Bluetooth is fast to connect but range is normal 10-15 feet.
Only thing lacking is the display for volume. That would have made this product a complete 5 star.",4
"+ve
Sound quality, build and material quality, sturdy, looks good in the drawing room.

Remote control is way below grade in both, looks as well as operation. Bluetooth connectivity loss happens at times. For FM, there is no way to know which channel is playing, no display, could be improved.",4
Good speaker on this price..little big..but still its fine..remote looks very cheap quality..soudn quality is fine..Bass is so much..,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Awesome sound clarity n good Bluetooth connectivity",4
"It's awesome for this price range
It's loud enough but it lacks the bass and treble button so it's like automatic. They are according to your song selection.
U can't set them or increase them.
A setback for bass lovers",5
"Sound quality is nice. Bluetooth auto connectivity I like ok..
I think produst is nice in this price range . Good for music lover. Go for it",4
I'd suggest you go for something else. Price doesn't justify the features. I bought it thinking philips is a good company. One of the speakers distort at high pitch and there is no way to control the subwoofer. The eq presets are bad.,3
"Overall its good..bass is awesome..but there is a small dent in d woofer..may b it was returned earlier by someone else.. anyway, product is satisfactory..",4
"No Bass/Treble adjust button, sound quality is okay as per the price range.",2

Great product. Brilliant Bass. Speciality is seperate bass adjustment. Sound doesn't hurts at full volume. Crystal clear audio. Good bass and treble combination. Must buy.,5
Orsm..just orsm..nice clear sound..nice bass...over all orsm..just a small problem .that have no display... otherwise its orsm,5
"The sound output was ok but the unit started malfunctioning within 10 days of buying, the bass effect has completely gone off. Before going off, the bass was unstable for some moment.",3
"Am bought it me and friend also.good quality and design, material.but bass level average.",4

It's an excellent product really...
If u want to buy it don't go back just order it....

Surely go for it it helps you give very clear and loud music with 100% volume and also enables a deep bass go for it if you want the best music feels from you setup,5
"Using for past 4 years no major issues.
Best Bass in 2.1 category. Build was good but the electronic buttons are not much reliable. Sometimes it changes itself to other mode like Bluetooth or any... very rarely...
Remote quality is not upto the mark.",4
the most third class sound i have ever heard .. don't buy this product.,1
"Everything is good on this product.
Remote control good but buttons not work properly some time if don't have remote you couldn't even start the speakers.
There no manual adjustment on sound only base and volume can increase or decrease.",4
"Bass is very low, and sub-woffer capacity is very low, you won't feel the bass in the songs or movie but sound is good.
Three stars for sound.
Zero stars for bass.

Fabulous look.üòò
Good for small hall.",4
I always used to purchase Philips audio system. This one is the most poor quality audio system. I wanted to purchase higher system in lieu of this one but the seller system did n't allow for upgrade. I have wasted my money.,1
"Good quality sound. Reasonable price. Connection with tv, bluetooth devices, mobile is very good.",5
"Poor Quality with Good Design, never going to buy a Philips product again. After few weeks of usage speaker started some noise. Remote stopped working . Within 4 months it become totally unusable.
Not sure about warranty. I have to run behind that now.",1
"This is a bass machine , mainly produce bass with any source. Treble is hidden or not audible when volume is high. There is option only to increse or decrease bass not for treble.",3
The product is very good .but the service of the Philips customer care and area manager is very bad and they are very irresponsible for doing their job and specifically the behavior of the area manager is very bad for the service.,5
"Good sound quality, good remote control and value for money. Bad is its woofer size, is too high given which I think unnecessary, taking too much space. Remain good.",4
Everything is too good except usb and sd card slot at back. you can enjoy the max sound by aux cable and pen drive. Bass is so high you will feel irritated if played at more than 50% in a closed room.,5
"Using this product since 5 months and found excellent. Sound quality is very good, Bass is amazing the only lag is it's remote. The remote has to be improved.",5
"It's been more than 5 years since I ordered it and it's still working like it's new ,superb bass ,superb connectivity ,just amazing product",5
Worst channel speaker. Bass was high but it blurred the music completely. Remote control is even cheaper than some cheap plastic toy. Just went by brand name and got cheated. Don't buy this product guys.,1
"Very poor Service from philips.will never buy philips again.
Bass is more than audio output because the two 4 inch speakers are very less in front of big towering bass.no display.hummming sound is always there.dont buy unless u only want bass.",2
Remote can be little bigger than provided. Excellent product from phillips. I connected to stb for better sound quality while watching tv,5
Good Sound quality,5
If you a bass lover then it is not for you. jbl go has enough bass than it.,1
This is a complete package at this price point. All connectivity including FM are working flawlessly,5
"On time delivery, thank you Amazon.
Packaging also very good, both speaker and woofer are in good condition. Easy to assemble.
Bluetooth connectivity very good, connect on single attempt.
Sounds quality crisp and clear with deep bass.
Value for money.",5
Product is awesome with very good sound quality but it has a defective remote set given with the set. Quality control team or technical team should check & pack before selling to customer. Any ways i was very disappointed.,4
Sound quality is very good the bass is very strong bluetooth connectivity is too good convenient to use the best part is that it massive 90 watt speaker ...Build is quality is so good,5
Remote control not working...what I have to do...shall I return only remote or complete system...pls advice...,4
"Dear sir/madam
My problem is one speaker is not working
I'm giving complaint but philips care not listening and my complaint is not rising still now I am using only one speaker please your side any help",5
"Great option for the price! Don't expect thumpy bass like f&d, bass is richer, and audio quality is much better. Satellite speaker wires are a bit short, might have to buy male-female Rca extension. Bluetooth functions and the remote are working perfectly for the time being.",5
Just mind blowing,5
"The left tower speaker only ticks when switched on/volume is changed. No music coming out of there. Good hardware build quality, great product design, however has failed to work. Have requested for a return and waiting for the same.",1
"Amazon plays major role in the cheating with this product , customer care will not support , product is worst it is not working but still Amazon people are not replacing the item üò°. Don't buy using Amazon, it useful only to buy product within 500.",1
Its been 3 months I have been using this awesome product and do not have any complaints. Being a music teacher i am totally satisfied by the indepth sound of bass and treble. Blutooth connectivity is an added advantage and stylish look is like an icing on the cake. Won't solve the purpose for outdoor parties or big rooms.,5
"Its really an awesome product and sonething you would get in reasonable price. Sound quality and the bass, both are just mindblowing and moreover, the product suits to even you compact personal space so smartly.
Overall, the product is worth it.",4
"Sound quality is good but the product we get is totally damaged ,even the product does not come in proper packing,both tower speaker is damaged",4
Value for money,5
One tower is crack,5
"The is too poor, dont buy this product beacuse you wont be able to refund it.
Philips is making fool out of us selling this cheap 2.0 speaker. Just because of the design dont buy it because the speaker music quality is too poor.üëéüèª",1
Best quality and worth purchasing it.,5
"The product we got was in damaged condition. Both the subwoofers were in damaged. Even the packaging wasn't proper. The sound quality is good but as we increase the volume it becomes worse.
Not satisfied with the product.
I will replace the product.",1
"DISSAPOINTMENT.
IT was a waste of money.
They stopped functioning an hour later after use, on the day it was delivered. No warranty was given and no return or replacement option.",1
My philps music system bad proudct Bluetooth connected not accept please my return request accepted,1

Sound Quality is Awesome,
BT is Very fastly Connected For Mobile BT,
Bass is Superb.
Nice Product
I've Give Five Stars
Thanq Phillips",5
Fantastic bass crisp sound ...a must buy product in the range .go for it without bothering anything,5
The volume control does'nt worked for the product above the system. At first this was working very smoothly & it was fab then the volume key stopped working ie if the volume is high then its high u can't control it.,1
"Best under 3k . Bt connectivity is excellent
In full volume there is no distortion. Excellent budget alternative for expensive soundbars",4
Product is excellent for this price range.. Installation is a walk in the park. Best thing I liked in this is Bluetooth and Aux both are there. Drawback is that the wire lenth is too short so cannot place the speaker too far away from the woofer.. Overall this is an excellent product.. Can go for it,4
"The speaker hangs in between and is not playing in sequence.. only 2 days old.
Last one was exchanged and it was having sound problem..
Philips is not up to the mark any more.
It has lost its quality",2
"Due to the name of the Philips company, I bought it online from Amazon without seeing it and without listening to it, but it is very poor here, its voice is very slow and the quality is not too.",1
"Good sound and Bass. FM reception is decent, but some channels are not very clear. BT is easy to connect and clear BT range is average, more than 5 meters is sometimes an issue.",5
"Super sound , blutooth is very nice, FM radio also working nice all over super product",4
"100% satisfied with. I m writing this review after getting a 2nd time product as a replacement. Product is so good, like the bass, crystal sound quality etc. Worth of it.",5
"Speaker output is very clear and excellent.

Bass output is excellent.

Bass can be adjusted by using remote.

Cons:
Wire length is short.",5
Sound quality very poor.....item dimension differ as mentioned in specifications...,1
Looks are good but sound output is average. Go for JBL soundbar (investing 3-4K extra).,2
Design is very good and sound quality also. Speaker also good but cable is very short from speaker to woofer...woofer is also very good...,5

"1. Blue Tooth range is pretty good
2. FM radio is quite noise free
3. Bass is high as per sound pitch

Sound quality is very good but some noise is coming from subwoofer cabinet. Like lose part hitting noise.,3
Product is very good. Bass is nice. Looking good. But amazon packing is very very poor. There is no amazon packing even no stiker only main unit packet i have got. It is very hopeless for me.,5

The 2.1 Philips is bombarding for a small room all things fits and works perfectly and it's more than I expected, the only thing that didn't reached to my expectations is the length of the wire. It's too short!!",4

"One of the best home theater system in budget under 3000.
THANKS
AMAZON",5
I have always been an avid fan of Philips electronic products so I went to buy these speakers with a blind eye. I am not an audiophile and was expecting a bit more on the sound but having said that it is a good buy for a mid size room at this price range.,4
"The sound output and quality is amazing.
Fits into my requirements just perfect. The only scope of improvement is the display... There is no digital display. Rest just pure rich experience.",5

"Value for money
Sound is clear but when playing in high volume the speakers are vibrating more..but still it's much better than others....",5
But we have no received any bill or warranty card I think in this type of product company give one year warranty otherwise everything was Gud in this product,4

The sound quality is very good. But yes shound is little bit low in volume but for the room 14x18. Overall experience is good.,5
Nice product at a reasonable price. Rs 6000,4
Remout controls use less,1
The product is good but it's space consuming if you have a small living room than it won't look good.,3
It's so good but sometimes it gets auto disconnected while connected with mobile Bluetooth! This issue is 0.5% of my uses.,5
Simply an amazing product from Philips. Never expected such a fine sound quality at marked price. Super bass with clarity in sound. Be it a movie or any music type sound output is just perfect.,5
Awesome..,5
Received damaged product and its not switching on asked for replacement let see for the best from amazon,1
"Amazing sound quality and Bluetooth quality, only thing is the console buttons repond a little late otherwise best buy of speakers till now",5

Really good speakers for the price. It has multiple input methods and inbuilt FM too. The only missing thing is no option to adjust treble. Bass is very good but a bit overpowering to treble. Very good for bass lovers.,4

"Best sound quality, and bass. Value for money.

"I was looking for a value for money radio with good sound quality. I previously had a Philips radio that costed me around Rs. 1150, but it went bad in a year's use. Also the radio was analog, so changing stations was a chore. I thought of getting a portable speaker with FM, buy decided against getting it because their sound is less, and they need to be recharged after some use. Plus their battery conks out in about a year or two of usage. Hence I was looking for a decent quality speaker system that I could use as a radio. While looking at different speakers, I found these were on sale at a discount, and the reviews were also good. Hence I purchased these for Rs. 2000 in sale.

Now let's begin with the pros:
1. The product was packaged well, and was delivered without any damage. When I took out the product out of the box, it looked sparkling new.
2. The speakers look really good, especially the center piece that houses the control electronics and the subwoofer. The LED lights do give it a very appealing presence.
3. Bluetooth connects quickly and easily.
4. And now most important plus point - the sound. These speakers sound incredible - and I mean truly astounding. The subwoofer is rated at just 20 watts, and the satellites are rated at 10 watts each. The satellites sound decent, but the subwoofer is just amazing. I just don't understand how a 20 watts subwoofer can sound so good. I am not saying that it sounds like a 1000 watts subwoofer, but the clarity and the volume of the bass are very good for its power rating. The subwoofer has a unique acoustic design. Usually the subwoofer is downfiring, sidefiring, or frontfiring, and there is a bass reflex tube somewhere in the box, that puts out additional bass. But this speaker's subwoofer is not at all exposed from any side. The bass comes out of only the bass tube. I just don't understand how can the subwoofer emit such good sound at good volume considering that the bass comes out of only the bass reflex tube. Seems like witchcraft to me. Not just is the bass very good, it is also very less directional. Place the subwoofer anywhere in the room, you will hear good bass everywhere. This is not usually the case with subwoofers. For most subwoofers, the bass is very directional, and it sounds good only at certain spots in the room. Not for this speaker though.

Now let's talk about the flaws:
1. The first one is the radio. The radio reception quality is bad. Unless the speaker is placed in the middle of the room with its antenna outstretched, the radio reception for most channels is bad. And the weird thing is, the speaker needs to be kept on for some time for it to be able to catch any FM channels. When cold, it doesn't catch any channels.
2. The second flaw is the FM channels autosave function. There is an FM autoscan and autosave function. It forgets the saved channels upon restarting the speaker system, and one needs to rescan the channels on every start.
3. The third flaw is the remote. The system responds to the remote commands only for a few seconds after it starts. If you don't send it commands with the remote after it starts, it responds to only the standby button. One needs to turn the system on and off for it to respond to remote commands.
4. The Bluetooth module of the speakers is of a lower quality, hence clarity when playing songs in Bluetooth is a little low.

I haven't checked playback using USB or SD card, hence can't comment on that.

As I said at the beginning of the review, I had purchased the speaker system for use as a radio. However, since the radio in this system is almost useless, I can't use it as a radio. Hence I have connected the speakers to my TV, and am using them with my TV. I think iball is very well aware of the major flaws in this system; that is why they are selling such a good sounding system at a big discount. I was able to find a use for this great sounding, but very flawed speaker system. Not sure if you will be able to.

So, should you buy this speaker system? Well, it depends on what you are going to put it to use to. If you are planning to use it as a radio, steer clear of this. If you are going to use it with SD card or USB, and are frequently going to change or select songs using the remote, look elsewhere. If, however, you plan to connect this system to a computer or TV, or play music using Bluetooth, you can't find a better sounding system upto Rs. 5K.

Update 15 June 21: In the original review, I attributed the trouble with the remote control to the flawed electronics in the speaker system. However, now I have come to the conclusion that the remote signal reception electronics in the speaker are not a problem, but the remote itself is the source of trouble. A remote control is a simple electronics device, and I did not suspect a brand new remote being faulty. The power and mute buttons on the remote function fine, but the rest of the buttons don't. Here's what you can try if you are having remote trouble:
1. Get a replacement remote from the service center. If your speaker system is within warranty, you will get it for free.
2. Press the back and front of the remote towards each other. Put pressure on the back and the front part where there are no buttons. That sometimes does the trick and the buttons start working.
3. If your system is already on, point the remote away from the system, and press the power and volume + buttons in quick succession. Then quickly point the remote towards the system and press the desired button. You can also try pressing power and some other button in quick succession. The remote sometimes functions okay immediately after the power button has been pressed.
4. Make a copy of your remote using an IR learning remote.

The rest of the flaws mentioned in the system are still present, and you should look at other options if you want trouble free usage.",3
Dont buy...this unless you want to hear only bass....you can not reduce the bass even though there is an option....the bass is to high and noisy dominating the satellite speakers. you cant understand the lyrics or dialogues or what ever which has to be produced by satelite speakers....trust me even you are a bass lover...you will hate this...such a cheap low quality bass,1
I brought this and within a month it is not switching on and been more than 25 days and yet no response or service,1
"So I receievd this product on this diwali 2k20, thank you amazon for quick delivery.

Let be very true if your are looking for good sound and bass for ur home purpose its good. My concern was bass which is pretty upto the mark in this cost.

It won't create much of disturbances to your neighbours even if ur playing in high volume.

Update : after 6 months of usage the circuit of the display is getting cut. No matter how good or cheap the product is always go for a branded one like Sony, Samsung, Philips, etc. As these won't ever dissapoint you.",5
Thanks for service but this product is when i setup whole speaker for my pc only one speaker work and 4 speaker very down sound. But when mob connect via BT all speaker better work. But i unsatisfied this product. I hope that next time giving best service. and i face same problem after replacement.,1
worst product dont buy it speaker has no bass.,1
Speaker is good and sound quality is also better in this budget. If you have small budget and want to buy home theater go for it without any doubt but only thing is that quality of product which Amazon should take care I received box which is little bit damaged and inside box two out of five speakers are damaged and also look like I received used product because it has scratches on some speakers. Overall product is good in this price range.,5

Super product.sound quality is soo good. I never expected this in this price. Worth for money I was using this since 2 months.after that I was writing this review.,5
Gifted to my Sis. I‚Äôm glad that she liked it & impressed with the Sound & Bass. At this price this is one of the great sound system. For those who are commenting that Sound & Bass is not good well you won‚Äôt be getting a Bose 5.1 at ‚Çπ3-4K. You‚Äôll need to spend 3-4Lakhs for that. So don‚Äôt expect Dolby Atmos sound at this range. And for the people looking for an sound system at budget then definitely this is for you.,5

"Alright. So, I ordered this speaker mainly because of its Bluetooth connectivity as my old Sony 4.1 lacks that particular feature and if I want to listen to some music from my phone in that speaker, I would have to physically connect it and then changing the songs when needed is a hassle. So, I was looking for a speaker at comparatively lower price that wouldn't compromise the sound quality. I usually buy speakers after at least listening to its sound in a shop, but this time I gave it a chance and trusted those many reviewers who said this is the best budget speaker with good enough sound quality and good enough bass. Well, I was kind of taken aback after seeing the actual woofer size. It was smaller than I expected and physical size does matter when it comes to bass and hence the bass is not solid enough. Now, don't misinterpret. It's a pretty thumpy bass and it doesn't cracks, but still it somehow lacks the solidity that I have heard in some other speakers. Clarity is really good, both over Aux and bluetooth. When it comes to the total loudness, it's not very loud really. Good enough for a medium sized room, but even with full volume at the speaker level and on the device, it won't blow your roof away...far from it. On the positive side, even at maximum volume the sound doesn't degrade and retains its quality. With bluetooth the sound loudness is at 90% that of what you get with Aux. The bass also goes down a bit with bluetooth. The bluetooth connectivity is awesome, instant, quality is good and doesn't have any noticeable delay(which I was worried about). As a result, I decided to use this speaker with my TV(over bluetooth) and I would keep my Sony for listening to music. By the way, the best part is the remote, it has many functions and the most usable are your ability to control sound level at each and every speaker and the woofer.

Edit : I want to add few points regarding the remote control. I found it bit hard to set up the FM channels. At first I didn't find the auto scan channel option. There is a scan button, but on pressing it, nothing happened(Later I found out from the manual you have to press it for 2-3 seconds to get it working). So, I had to manually tune and find each channel by using tune+ - buttons. And then it was really tricky to save those channels once you find it. On pressing the Save button, it always tries to save them under Channel 01, and changing the name is a bit tricky, I am sure you will figure it out. The good thing is, you can directly type in any channel frequency number from the numeric keypad on the remote. So, in FM mode if you type 938, it will take you to 93.8 FM channel. That's good. The only downside to this remote control is, it has no mute option. In the manual it says, the REPEAT button will function as Mute, but it doesn't work.",4
Such a nice product. Using it for more than 2 years. Bluetooth connectivity looks fine as well as the sound quality.,5
Nice home theter product,5
Working as expected,5
"The sound is very clear. The bass control is not available in your remote, you have to adjust it from your playback device. This home theater will be perfect for a 15'x18' room. If you are hosting a house party this gadget will defenitely increase your reputation. Better than expensive portable sound speakers. If portability is not a primary requirement, go for it.",5
Awesome product this is the major product any one wants to buy,5

It is not bad for the price but if I have to be nit picky, then the bass is way too heavy when compared to the treble on the system. Sometimes, the bass is so heavy that it overtones the dialogues when you are watching a movie or a show and if you try to balance it out, then the audio quality deceases drastically.",3
Sound quality is good and the bass is perfect for small room,5
Good effective,5
I love this i am enjoying this product before 6 months,5
Audio clarity is excellent. Bass is medium. Sometimes woofer gives cracking sounds.,5
"Supper products supper sound , good bass realy supper",5
Bass quality is not good,5
Sometimes Bluetooth not connecting to paired devices,5
Nice product,5
"Look-wise its excellent. But overall bass delivery is poor. But for this price range it is ok. Loud enough, speaker and central system design and quality is good. Only drawback is its poor sub woofer performance. Rest every feature is good enough to compete with any other leading brands. I am using it with philips DVD player for the last 1.5 years. For home, small room it can provide decent sound but never expect a deep bass from this model.",3

"Pros:
1.Surround Sound
2. Competitive Price
3. Bluetooth Connectivity
4. Can connect with Dish/Tv easily (cable available)
5. Can increase volume of EACH speaker separately.
6. Quality Sound.

Cons:
1.Only good for a small room. I put it in hall and can't even hear sound in the next room. But nice surround experience though.
2. I bought it in an offer. If I would have paid a greater money, I would have found it just average.
3. Every speaker doesn't emit the same amount of sound, don't know why though.",4

"Sound quality:
I replaced the product two times for same reason, the sub woofer was makin a low frequency noise or cracking kind of jarring sound. After replacing for the 2nd time, the problem was same.
Infact the person who came to replace, he also mentioned that due to the same problem the other customers are also replacing the item.

Remote control:
As far as good for home purpose usage.

Bluetooth connectivity:
Another blunder here. Within 1.5 mtrs range the Bluetooth starts breaking the sound.
The Bluetooth gets disconnected and The sound starts breaking unless you're sitting very very close to the speaker, which is not possible all the time to keep your mobile phone near speaker. Then why Bluetooth!

Zebronic, please Make quality product. Being a musician it's very bad experience for me with Zebronic sound system. Though the price is lesser than other speakers, but the quality is also cheaper. Didn't expect this much dissatisfaction I'll experience with the quality.
Thank you for keeping a replacement option along with refund option.",2

"* It's just 5.1 only, no one surrod sounds etc mentioned on this product specifications actually..
* Local Zebronic service support accepted it's just basic model, so can't expect more..
* After reading all reviews only I'm purchased this product, now I don't have options for replacing..
* Remote sensing power also too low..
* I can't save my volumes every speakers here, once switched off, it's going default settings, that default settings also useless..
* FM not working properly, Chanel's not working after my auto tuning..
* My simple Question, what's the mean for 5.1..??

"REVIEW AFTER 2 YEARS: Zebronics 5.1 Home Theatre System is the Best and great performance like Sony Systems. Sounds are very best and Good Clearance. Subwoofer Giving bass Effect very highly. No others speakers give bass at this Price Range. ‚ö†Ô∏èI have extended the wires of this speakers for my room size.
TIPS FOR BEST BASS OUTPUT:
1. Subwoofer Should Place in ""Floor Only.
2. Equalizer should change to Eq2 on system or Connect with TV with AUX cable & adjust your favourite Equalizer.
3. Reduce the volume of FR FL CE SR SL speaker's on remote to (-10).
4. Increase the Volume of SW (SubWoofer) to (+10).
5. Speakers should keep seperately to Best Theatre Feeling.",5
"I'm a big fan of Zebronics. And like always they've met my expectations, even exceeded them. Sound quality is awesome for audiophiles. Balanced output, adequate loudness and bass. Doesn't hurt the ears as a sharp piercing noise even at the highest volume level. No audible distortion. After sales service is great. Overall a highly recommended sound system.",5
"Very good product, good speaker, we can connect everything like USB, FM, SD CARD, BLUETOOTH, DVD, AUX CABLE for computer and Mobile ,,, really good and low price, every one can buy this and every one can satisfy with this product ,,, and Amazon correct time delivery , Thanks,,, now I am planning to buy this product one more",5
"First of all speaker looks very nice in black colour. And sound was good yes it was better than Phillips Heartbeat so double thumbs up üëçüëç for sound. Speaker was suitable for all kinds of room wether it was any room as well as it was also used in small restaurant and shops also. Firstly other speakers of zebronics 4.1 mm speaker but there was a difference of just 500 rupees. So i bought this and yes i'm satisfy. If Amazon had a option for video uploading then i definitely upload that video. So go for it guys it will never ever disappoint you.

There was just a problem with packaging which Amazon have to improve that there was just a double layer of plastic sheet. That's it. So it needs a improvement.",5
"Totally worth the price. Good quality product by Zebronics. They usually make good products barring a few exceptions.
The wattage is around 70 combined. Treble, bass and volume control with an equalizer. Perfect for a 200 sq feet room.
Can get rather loud, of course that is relative, so caution while hammering away at night.
Would definitely recommend this product for a price of 2999, its a steal. Bluetooth and a remote with a good 20 feet of range are great too.
Oh and did I mention theres a radio and USB device too along with the fact that it is a 5.1.
Okay I think you get the hint.",5
"A very Good product for the Price what we pay..Almost used this product for more than 6 Months
Pros:
Good build quality
Nice Midds and Bass
Good Sound for price
Bluetooth Functionality
SD card Function",5
"Product is very good as shown in the picture.
It is suitable for compact room . Don't expect too much. Surround system is as much as good. But the length of the wire should be shot. But rest of the things is good.
Pros :
Value for money (‚Çπ3000)
Compact home theatre
User friendly
FM
USB
BT
AUX, SD
All in one

Cons:
Short wire
You can satisfy the sound only if your volume is high level (60)

This is all about my purchase review. I'll update my review after use the product may me in one month.",5
"Its really good value for money product
Great quality of sound and bass
Its the best if yoy ask me in this range.
But they did not provide battery for the remote.",5
"Bass is ok and in full sound, good to hear in low volume.
Bluetooth sound is excellent, connect automatically. I'm using with my laptop.",4
"the product is overall good because I already use before the brand. but sad to say this time I found two defaults 1)the product found defect not working mode after delivery and get a replacement.
2) after getting a new one still found one of the speakers (out of five ) one is not working.
I will say its better to purchase from the shop instead of giving online particularly for the music system.
amazon & vendor to take care of this.",3
"Wow. I searched for Bluetooth 4.1 an this was 1st search result a 5.1 bluetooth. I am so lucky :). Everyone this product is great from Zebronics without a doubt. You won't find better Bluetooth speakers in this range. Sound is awesome, bass is good enough. I also have 2.1 and 4.1 Bluetooth speakers of zebronics and both cannot be compared with this one.",5
"I cannot write a review in a situation when music system is not functioning properly.

When I received the product, I found the seal on Sub-Woofer was damaged. I ignored that tried to connect USB to play some music. Unfortunately, USB was not detected by the system. I tried with the same USB which I am using in my car, but I thought there are more than 1000+ songs and may take time to read and play music.

After that, I have tried with another USB device with 10+ songs and selected USB mode. Unfortunately, it didn't work. I was surprised and tried to check Bluetooth function. It worked fine and finally, I was able to play music on this system, but I had disappointment.

Sub-woofer not worked. I have tried with 5.1 Channel DVD player, but it didn't work too.

Overall,

The seal was broken.
USB Not Worked.
Sub Woofer not worked.

And I received damaged product with QA Passed Broken Seals, which do not make any sense.",2
Product is good . Good bass in low volume . Sound quality is better at this price . One speaker was broken a liitle while shipping .,5
"Using this for the last 3 months.

"Product is really good and worth for money, only one cons is, when power is switched on, volume sounds high to 45, has to be manually reduced the volume, satellite speakers comes without hook r a whole r a holder, can't hang on wall, provided clamps to do so, other than this, its a nice product",4
"I used and tested it in pc, android, led and also used the FM . Its awsome and bass and treble is nice just need to know the use of Remote. best speaker and quick delivery.",5
It's a good product and the speaker's are suburb sound quality and the bass is ossom,5
Honest review. Dont buy this. First i thought that the price 3k obviously the overall quality would be very good. But when i connected with my tv or phone. Sound is normal but bass is nit upto the mark. Unsatisfied. Yesterday i got and i want to sell that now.,3
"No 1
Connected to my tv, dvd working awesome
Bluetooth connectivity is super
Fm is not so good there is issue with signals
May be they have provided nice arial wire",5
"Well.
Please avoid this speaker if you are a good music lover. It has a very low volume and bass which can not meet your expectation. I am wondering how can some gave a good rating to this.
This is a pathetic product I bought just after reading some positive reviews.

And the funny this is that if you chat with Amazon customer care they will force you to keep the product whether you want or not. That does not in their policy. They have their standard words format.
Thank God i got my refund or else i would have filed a case against Amazon for making customer fool and forcing to keep a product.

And another funny thing is here. This product is available on 2700/- in Market i just got to know this Saturday wherein Amazon is selling in 3700.

So please avoid to buy. You can get an awesome speaker in 3700/- in your local market just take your steps out. I got a good one and the sound is awesome.",1
"Superb speaker system,bass is very good.
I bought this for rs2500,worth for the price",5
"Amazing product
I'm using it for 2 years now
It's good for a small crowd or hall.
Amazing bass and everything....",5
The speakers are good ..sound is also enough for the price range...a very good bass is also there.... But sadly there are no holes in the speakers to mount them on wall. The mounting parts are provided in the box but no holes are drilled on the speakers.. So don't expect it's easy to wall mount it. Those who want already drilled holes don't go for this product,4
"Very Cool Product by Zebronics... Brought it @t Great Indian Sale @2300...!!!!

Superb Sound Quality and Bluetooth Connectivity is also Nice...!!!

Thanks Amazon Team for Guaranteed 1 Day Delivery..!!!!",5
"Looking good..
Fast delivery...
bluetooth working fine from my laptop and mobile
fm working good.
i gave only 4 star coz of less bass.
only demerit is less bass...
other than that worth for given money...",4
"These valued speakers are very bang for buck they sound average with most of it taking the bass.
The satellites are a bit non-effective as you can't tell that they are working may be its the content.
They don't have a hole on back to hang them to nail on walls so stuck placing all them side by side infront of me
the sub woofer takes most of content and the satellites just enhance it .
remote control is good. one bad thing is we have to turn on the speakers every time it is switched on with remote or buttons on it to use it.",4
"Very nice bass effect......it's Bluetooth connectivity is awesome,gud product to buy at this price....one little drawback is wires of front speakers is little short!",4
"Good product. Value for money but at full volume speakers crying a bit
Pros:- Bluetooth, 5.1 channels, stylish design, average bass.
Cons:- a bit low on volume but it is great for price, best buy below 3k",4
Very nice product,5
"Well i ordered this speaker system for a huge room which is my in-house gym. I had read on the product page that its 65w output(it is suppose to be very loud). Points:-
Delivery:- Got the product on time with safe delivery and everything was in best shape.
Sound quality:- Well here comes the down size, I thought a 5.1 configration with such huge watts would sound great.I never expected it to be a rock concert loud but a descent loudness with good music clarity were my expectations. It didnt do well in that department as
1. The bass levels are too low for a 5.1 setup
2. Music clarity is distorted
3. No matter how hard you tweek your EQ you end up having although same level of music
at first I thought it was with bluetooth port but when i connected aux I got the same music level. I am a big time audiophile and i have Harman/Kardonn go+play in my room. All I wanted was a good base thumping speakers for a moderately huge room which i thought a 5.1 setup of these speakers would do but now I am unsatisfied

Recomendations:- If your requirements are as same as mine(A good base system for gyming), then I ll suggest picking something else. I have kind of wasted my money here I wouldnt suggest you same.",3
"After using this for one month i am writing this review..
This sound system is a nice one and very much value for 3k.
1.Suitable for 15*20 room and enough loud.
2.able to play FLAC and WAV format(sometimes sucks)
3. Bluetooth connectivity is very good and even plays as the same quality from your phone.
4. Very decent audio if it's a 80s audio..
You can improve the sound by using your phone audio effects or Dolby atmos app while using bt.
So it's worth buying it.",4
"A good 5.1 speaker with woofer with Bluetooth option, performance wise good bass and sound control. I am satisfied",5
"First Of All Sound Of Speakers Are Very Low ,And In Full Volume It not Give Clear Sound ,And Bass Is Very Low.Not Value For Money Instead Of This I Prefer Creative 2.1 Speakers It Give You More Sound ,Bass And Satisfaction then this.Dont Buy This, It's Worst Product.Company Try To Attract The Coustmer Without Giving The Quality In Product , Company Focus Only In Quality.Thats Bad.",2
Excellent product... Do go for it... Value for money!!,5
Superb....I got an ultimate product from Amazon. Zebronics BT6590 home theater with deep bass and multiple interfacing options including Bluetooth in moderate price. Damn satisfied,5
awesome product at a minimal cost. I would advise everyone to go for it. soung quality best & base is also appreciable. üòç,5
"Sound is very clear
Each every instrument is playing well and clearly Bluetooth connection is well",5
Overall product is good only thing that i received a broken aux cable also i am finding difficulty in connecting FM.,2
"Loud, clear, crisp sound!",5
"Sound quality is good
Bass quality then ok
Remote control better
Bluetooth connectivity superüëç
Build quality is good
Look is very nice",5
"Product is very Good..Perfect for Small to Medium Sized hall..u can enjoy very good Bass...good Surround, good Dividing, fine look and the only thing worried about is the you can njy volume only after 40+ points. since the 0-30 points, its nothing and 55+ means again no that much good.",4
"Not satisfied with the product . Just okay!
Got it in lightning deal for just INR - 2299
Pros-
*loud sound
*Bluetooth supported
*inbuilt FM
*5.1
Cons-
*bad sound clarity
*only loud sound, if u lower the volume , it gets much lowered that u can't listen it!
*wired speakers (not satellite)
*quite low sound from speakers
*no bass at all !
It's just okay for rs - 2299/-
Don't waste ur money on this, spend a bit extra n go for phillips",2
Product so wonderful and sound perfect. I suggest low price Perfect 5.1 home theater. No problem this home theater. Please Pallavi madam replace order dispatch soon.,5
Awesome product in this price range.... Superb bass and superb sound clarity.... Go for this without any doubt.....,5
"good product super bass. the sound feels like a real experience it's give very impressive sound
thanks amazon",5
"Great Sound, Great Product! Best Deal at that Price! Worth Recommending.",5
This product is value for money because you will get best sound quality in this price range And I bought this @2500 only,5
"Guys according to price it's good, not that great or super. Sound quality is good no disturbance up to 80 percent volume, satelite speaker cables are not that lengthy, if you are going to buy even for a small room you will need 2 extra cables to get good audio effect, you will not get any equalizer control neither on remote nor on main speaker, buttons on woofer are a bit hard i felt they may be of a bit good quality, bass is good but treble is low overall it's ok for me. if you are in a budget and small room you can go for this undoubtedly. connects very well with usb,here i forget to mention you need an adaptor to connect sd card or a card reader. every speaker volume can be controlled by remote it works a bit like equalizer and that's all",3
Worth purchase. Working good. It is very useful in bed room or a small single room user.,5
"Decent product
Sound 8/10
Best for small room
But overall product is decent and genuine with the price you are getting it I'll say go for it if you are a music lover , it will blast your room if you are a heavy metal fan",4

"Writing a review after 5 months, the hometheater works perfectly and the base is good too you cant complain for that. The quality of the sound is not very bad, it does the work and for the price i have to say you literally can't complain. It also has some extra features like adjusting the sound of each speaker, etc. The build quality is super awesome, it doesn't look cheap at all. At the end i could say its worth the money.",4

Very nice sound. Bass is good. Best buy at this price. I bought it for 2200. 2 satellite speaker are of length 3.5 meters. 3 are of 1.5 meters. Bluetooth connectivity is good. I got an extra white connector wire which was damaged but luckily I had no use of it. It might have been of other device packed by mistake. One good thing is that you can control volume of each satellite speakers independently. If you are planning to buy just go for it.... I waited long for a sub woofer. I am musician myself. I am very happy and content with this product,5

We didn't arrange the sound boxes in air those are laid down on the floor if we hang them to wall hope the sound is v good.

But the vendor is not packed the product properly i got a small damage to the woofer box at the corner.",5
Dislike,2
"Superb speakers, good bass efect fully remote control function",5
"well the product i really good for its price but when you order you can most probably assume that it may have some damages on the exterior, overall it got delivered really fast the sound and base is good for the price you are paying obviously you can expect the quality to be as good as Sony or any other high range products. Bluetooth connectivity is also amazing. Overall good purchase neglecting the minor damages on the exterior.",3
"65W speaker, we can't get for this price. You can go ahead for small room. This box contains wire, remote, sattelite speaker mount bracket etc.,",3
SO ! SO ! not up to the mark.,2

But please please don't go for it...",1
"super sound quality,very low price , amazing bass effect very nice product",5
Good sound quality,5
Rear left and right speaker cables are not long enough.. better buy some extra cable along this. Best suited for a 10*10 room.. if the room is any bigger this wouldn't do the job.. overall for a 10*10 this does the job pretty neatly.,4
"Received just today
Returned it asap
I am a bass lover. The volume of the speakers is good but the bass effect is not upto the mark.",2

"Giving this review after 1 year of Purchase and Usage..
Since I am a low budget user i came across this product searching for good quality 5.1 speakers . I searched several speakers and roamed shopping malls to check thier quality(i literally did this :P).. I personally liked this product and compared the prices here on amazon..
Believe me you wont get this sound quality on any low budget home theatres..

Pros:

1- Awesome Sound Quality
2- Total 6 speakers which makes us feel really surrounding
3- Powerful sub woofer
4- Attractive Design with powerful LEDs
5- Bluetooth 3.0 support with dedicated controls (Which you won't get in this Price range , it's my guarantee;)
6- FM receiver with an antenna
7- Separate remote to control each speaker , equalizer and subwoofer controls
8- Long wires to set it up on corners
9- Sturdy and strong cabinets
10- Free AUX wire :D (doesnt come with any other product)
9- Super Attractive price

Cons :

1- BlueTooth range is about 15 metres, so limited to single , or maximum two rooms
2- At around Max Volume, SUB-Woofer is powerful enough to move from its place on its own (haha)

Don't forget to give me a thumbs up ;)",4
How to increase Baas of Home theoter.,3

No.. because it contains poor FM and worst remote. Close to null button function and whichever button function that we need to press 5-6 times then they function. This is the first time Amazon made me very much dis-satisfied with their product.,2
This is a super quality item i am enjoying a lot thanks to amazon.,5

"All in one with all features like Bluetooth, SD card and Pen drive. I liked the product. Bass and speakers quality and output is fantastic.
Only thing is when we switch on music system it is defaulted to Bluetooth mode.
I was expecting audio by default because I connected to my TV. Only this we need to change it to AUD audio mode if we need to use along with TV. I got it for Rs.3350.",5

One more thing for seller. Delivery was really fast. I got the product 3rd day after booking even in rural location. Thanks Amazon and Seller.",5
I like this product digging is most but saund quality is mediam,4
"First of all , they give wrong description.

Woofer just 18W + Speakers 5W = Total RMS 38W only
Volume very low
If you play in full volume little bit ""gurrrrr"" sound
For lite use ok ,not ok for music lovers

Very Average product",2
The bass is very low. The sound comes more on the clear side with not much bass to enjoy the music. The speakers are good for FM however I did not pay that much just for the FM! Music without a rich bass isn't the music at all!,3
Worth for money. I ordered i ball tharang seeing the positive review but the bass and sound quality was very low. I made a risk to order philips 4.1 speaker inspite of many negative reviews but it is really worth. The product serve its purpose well. Go for it,5
I was an ardent fan of Philips products...I am totally disappointed from the present product..I am giving 2 stars because of my allegiance to Philips brand...but this model pathetically failed in all...only the BLUETOOTH connection was good..buy. The sound from woofer was really low..also the satellite speakers were little low in quality..I have returned the product and will not recommend to others .. although the stars received were by early reviewers the present reviews now point that the product is no good..sorry Philips..you let me down miserably...,2
This 4.1 speaker system provides good quality sound with enough bass and clarity. Two negative points are below average remote which only works within 10mtrs & need to be in straight line with the unit and the short length cables for the surround speakers.,4

"This is the first time I have Philips product in my possession but I feel its not upto the mark. I found it is not at all satisfactory, I am not happy... Bad product hope this product was made in China.. going to return this.....",1
"1. At first I would like to tell that ""BASS"" is best part of these speakers when you full the volume you still the heart damping bass . I am in love with tha bass .

2. Looks what would I say about the looks are pretty decent but these actually look good the front is loaded with a black grill and on the upper side we can see a little LCD panel which looks so -so .

3. It is very loud for a average room and the sound and bass is enough for a big room or hall

At the end I would say that it is great product at this price",5
"Firstly I bought this. But there was problem with the woofer, so I replaced this product.
Worth for money. Supperb product and best thing is MADE IN INDIA üáÆüá≥",5
"Sound quality is good in terms of Bass. Satellites could be better. Material and Built quality is good. Remote response is very bad, you need to hold just in front of main unit.

I am using Phillips products for more than a decade but never seen such substandard product. There is only one Phillips batch on front grill of speakers. On the rear there is no branding or logo of Phillips. If front batch is removed, nobody can identify these as a product of Phillips. Same case with remote. Even RCA Cables are very low grade. This product seems to a localy manufactured with a Phillips branding. Even User Manual looks like a Black & White photocopy of original.

My previous Phillips products are old but far better than these. There is proper branding with Phillip's Logo on every part of product i.e Main unit, Speakers, Satellites Speakers, Remote Control and even Cables.",3
"Its a good speakers for home, looks nice. Volume is okay not to loud nor to low, Its Bluetooth conectivity is good, from 4 speakers 2 speakers have a long cable to connect while 2 have a short cable and at that time you need a connector which is easily available at electronic shop.Value for money. Remote control does not have battery..",4
"I think they delivered me Refurbished product ., one speaker mesh has undulations.,

This is very bad., taking whole amount , delivering used piece(low cost price refurbished ) .... very bad ., if I knew u people going to send refurbished piece , I would have ordered refurbished piece only , it‚Äôs less price ... stop playing this kind of cheap tricks .....",2
"Overall a very good product as per price. Very good sound and base.. good for small parties in closed rooms..

3 things that can be updated or changed is
1) giving all 4 wire of equal size
2) remote only works when pointed exactly in front of the system and doesn't have any Bluetooth button so we have to go and switch on the Bluetooth mode from system can't be done from remote
3) sound quality can be improved a bit more.. very good till 24 after that is starts buzzing in your years and clearity decreases.",4
It's awesome,5
"The subwoofer is tooo good.
The overall rich feeling of the sound is increased by a lot.
For just 4000, the sound quality is really good and you can feel the base.
If you put in a thumpy soundtrack. You can feel the base within you.
Too good",5
"Just received the PHILIPS (UA55AUE70AKLXL) System now (23.5.2021 @ 1PM)...
Absolutely Sub Standard Sound quality....
using few other Music Systems from BOSE to Creative and expected this PHILIPS would be atleast avaragely Okay ... even I may rate CREATIVE low end models far far better compared to this PHILIPS Model - UA55AUE70AKLXL (Rs.4030/-) ... even rating 1 Star would be excess...

Creative Models around 2000/- ranges are much better than this Product....

Easy to connect Bluetooth- FM Connection awesome easy ti connect- no bass control on remote - No volume control for single speaker",1
Came with a good package. Quality is very good. Bass is good but expected some more. It is not detecting the sd card kept in adapter. The main problem which I faced with the remote. It is catching the signals of ap fiber setup box and the set box remote is catching home theatre. The plastic of remote is OK. But the home theatre performance is fully satisfying.,4
Good home theatre but when switch on the tv with home theatre everytime we need to give input option button want set either by bluetooth or any cables..... Default sound set is 15point when switch on the tv.. volume level must be 30point....... Most important thing is volume control must be give.... Make it default mode as aux....,2
This awesome by Philips. I never thought this kind of quality @this price. Great work for small flat room. But make sure this is not for >300sqft room size.,5
"Product is exactly as mentioned in the display. Sound effects are good though not great. Remote could have been better as the buttons are like car audio system remote, too small. Worth the money.",5

Mostly I use for gaming and casual music, if your looking for bass I would recommend to go beyond 10k.

Just a waste of time.. please don't bus this ... First I bought this .. first time one of the speaker is not working.. then I asked for replacement even in that replacement also bass is not working perfectly... Such a waste,1

"ABSOLUTE VALUE FOR MONEY. Good sound. In the cost it's better than my expectations. We can hear the quality treble & bass the way it's produced in the tracks.
No complaints from a user who listens to music on it 24/7.
Thank You Philips & Amazon.",4
"This product more deferred from Picture and not satisfied, I like to return this product and need to return money",1
"I bought it from an offline store after comparing couple of more speakers in similar range. Also l bought this because unlike a few other Philips model, it's not made in China...it's made in India üòäMy verdict will be as below:

1. Sound: Sound quality is really good, clarity is nice with no distortion. However I would prefer the volume to keep in mid-range (17 to 22), even the low is quite nice and you can listen to your favourite music at as low as 3 with adequate clarity and bass. That's a good thing about this speaker.

2. Bass: Just adequate, not too much not too low. You can adjust the bass to your liking. What I like about the bass is that it's pleasing to ears. However don't expect anything really punchy like some of the top brand like JBL. Overall you won't be disappointed.

3. Loudness: Sufficient, afterall you don't want your neighbours to complain!

4. FM: FM reception is average and clarity as well. There is an inbuilt antenna which you need to adjust. What I was disappointed to see that you cannot store a FM station to a particular number as per your preference. It just has automatic tuning option and channels will be stored to a particular number from 1 to 9 as it tunes. You can't change that.

5. Remote and Bluetooth: Bluetooth works as expected. But I am bit disappointed with the Remote as it seems to be slow and out of sync at times. For example if you change the volume, it may end up changing from blutooth mode to USB mode. There is a definite quality issue.

6. Build quality: Happy with the build quality.

Final verdict: So far really happy with my purchase, specially the sound quality. But I think it will be too early to comment as i can see some definite quality issues. Also already I can see few customer has complained about speakers stopped working after 1 to 4 months of time. I think here Made in India still needs to do a lots more catch-up with Made in China. I had one similar Philips home theatre which was made in China and ran like a charm for 7 years without any problem. I would have given a 4 Star without this quality issues.",3
"Worst deal.
Bluetooth failing,
Remote control not working...

I feel betrayed by Amazon :(",1
"I bought these speakers, they have good bass and loud enough sound for one room or hall, crystal clear sound, works with pen drive, blutooth, AUX and it has FM also. Card slot is also there. I would recommend everyone to buy without any second thought. Instead of buying the costly JBL speakers, Philips is better if compared to the price and the quality you get in that price!",5
Boss. Not good I'm not satisfy. Today product delivery bt today 400rs less then product,1
Good product but bass is average not for bass lover but I am bass lover so I am not satisfied by bass sound quality is very good but bass.....üòëüòë and Bluetooth connectivity is average laghbagh 5 to 6 M connection.

"I have been using this hometheatre system for last 10 days with all different kind of setups - Movie, music, gaming
So I believe am ready to give a review from a regular user usage feedback .
Firts things first
I got the product from the seller- Appario retail and they have given me an already opened + used product and I was really shocked to see that.
I was thinking whether to return it on the same day but thought of using it for once to see if it has any defects.
but surprisingly the speaker was all fine, dint fine any issues or something. so decided to keep the product anyway , so a bid thumb's down for the seller Appario retailers.
now coming back to the speaker performance
I don't knw why many reviews says that the Bass is not good, for me the bass is just perfect, I only set the bass level to 6 or to 8 max(out of 12) and the bass just pumps in perfectly and shakes my room pretty good.
I have been using it with PS4,LAPTOP,Tv, and Mobile and every ports does work but only the HDMI and Optical outputs 5.1 with ofcourse 5.1 content.
But worst+sad+bad thing with the setup is the sound bar channel seperation. i would say its 0 out of 5, yes the sound clarity is just sony level but u can't get or feel the front left+center+front right channel seperation from the sound bar, you can only feel the seperation if u sit just infront of the sound bar and within 1 meter distance, if you sit far than this u will just feel it like a 3.1 system ( 1 left rear + 1 right rear+ 1 front speaker) so u really won't get the Dolby theatre like feeling from this speakers even though they are marketed as a 5.1 I would suggest to go for Individual 5.1 speaker setup rather than the sound var setup if u r really a guy like me who give importance to the surrounding effect.
so this is my verdict,
if u just want a really good speaker system for music+regular media watching this speakers are fine, but if u mainly get this for the home theatre 5.1 experience dont go for it, go for a system which has either separate channel speakers or a better soundbar which can may be give much more channel seperation
thnx",3
"I wanted to buy HT-RT3 but since i saw this model at lower price i bought this.

It is new model launched by sony on FEB 7 2020, the only 5.1 model with soundbar and BT, HDMI ARC, optical cable support below 15K i guess.

All comes in one L shaped Box.
Bar have holes, you can Mount to wall. (No setup is provided in box for wall mounting)

Pros: It has HDMI ARC support, optical cable support, BT, okay for beginner version of home theatre.
Sound quality is fine.
Okay with Bass(actually it did not meet my expectations)

HDMI cable not provided. Buy it seperately.

I have used it for 1 day and okay with the performance at this price (Not too much excited with performance yet). Better performance cab be seen once i place soundbar above ground/wallmount. I will upload more Information after 1week of usage.",4
"Sound is as expected. It has all the necessary options like STANDARD,CINEMA,MUSIC & VOICE.
What i did noticed is that at Low Volume level like below 10 it does not give you any sound, you can not even hear if music is playing or not which was not expected.

i have ordered an replacement.Hope for positive results.",4
"This system is just a 2.1 system with speakers added to make it 5.1 . Sound is very weak. HDMI arc is a joke. You expect crisp sound quality, but what you get is just a normal sound in even watching HD channels. This system is not worth 2000/= Rupees. I am disappointed. I chose Sony , for my trust on the brand. But this‚Äôs pathetic. My sincere advice to customers, please listen this audio-system in a Sony -Center and then decide. Don‚Äôt buy this ,seeing reviews. Make your own independent decision. After all it‚Äôs our hard earned money.",1
Worth buying this product...,5
"Sound quality : 5 star out of 5.
Bass :: Perfect
Sorrounding sound :: perfect
Everything is perfect..
** If you connect through BT :: then you will get perfect sound
But through Aux cable :: volume is very low ..
Also you should connect it with :: Optical cable or HDMI ARC for best 5.1 ch sound..

Update after 2 month :: For 5.1 sound use vlc and enable passthrough offtion ... And use ac3 codec because it only support ac3 Dolby digital not EAC3 ( it will behave like 2.0 ) no DTS sound comming out .....( U can use pot player also with ac3 reencoding oftion )) :: laptop user has to buy amazon hdmi spdif converter .....
( Buy bluerigger HDMI cable because it is only cable with transmit ac3 ,,, many people think 5.1 means 5 speaker playing together but it is not ,, 5.1 means 5 speaker or 6 play separately...so bluetooth only play 2.1 ( it's normal ) ,,, try this and enjoy the budget surrounding sound ... (( Surrounding means :: 6 speaker play separately ,, not together )),, so for that use only ac3 codec via laptop or tv (( with passthrough enable )) otherwise you will get 2.1 and you will think it is my 5.1 sound because 5 or 6 speaker playing together ......",5
"Quick Note- Sony does not reply to emails _ I have written 24 emails in last 1 month and have called multiple time, All thy do is reply once, that we are looking into it.
Thanks to amazon I was able to return it, Else Sony had decided to commit fraud- Even after making a video of their employe at my home that admits there is an issue, Their senior leadership refused to acknowledge any issue- imagine their attitude

Sony has not mentioned anything about compatibility and neither has VU.
I own a VU 4k 50 Inch tv which has both HDMI ( E-ARC ) port and optical port for best audio video quality, However, This soundbar is not compatible with it. Note* VU TV is not a Android one, but a smart TV.
My entire experience has been been extremely unpleasant. VU says its Sony's fault and Sony says its VU fault but in the end the end the customer suffers.

Spent 15k plus 2 k on cables and I am still listening to the sound from my Tv only.
NOTE* These are non returnable items so check compatibility before you buy.",1
"I bought it by its brand,but I got completely wrong. Its material quality is best,but sound quality is very poor.
A true music lover can understand this. Though it is 5.1, sound is barely coming through its satellite speakers. And subwoofer is worst quality,bass is not rich it sounds like local 2000 china speaker. It don't feel like Sony's bass quality at all, I'm totally disappointed with this product. I mean how Sony can produce this type of soundbar? It is not worth at all.
People who don't have any knowledge about sound quality will write a review that absolutely fine good bass but please don't listen to this. Don't go for this",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Best sound bar for TV. Especially sound quality is very good and dialog are very clear. Below is sample video. Tested on Bluetooth with 50% volume.
And sound modes are not working via Bluetooth. I think it will work only on HDMI. And only bass you can adjust threw remote. There is no treble option available in remote.

Sound quality 5/5.
Bass 4/5.
Connectivity 5/5.
Build quality 5/5.",5
"1. Sound quality is high compared to other brand 5.1

2.bass is perfect beat no more less or higher.
3.No vibration or noise when volume goes to even maximum (100).
4.Sound is very clarity even full volume.
5.Dolby effect is great. Bluetooth transmit 5.1 channel over tv to subwoofer.
6.Dolby effect also works with bluetooth connection.
7.grear surrounding effect worth for budget.

Great Sony product with 15k

"I have writen a review after 2 day usage of this soundbar.
Those people who are finding a cristal clear cinematic sound this is the perfect choice. I have purchased Boat Avante 1550 and Obage DT 2605 before this one. But Sony HT-S20R has fully satisfied to me with sound quality and build quality.
For best experience of surround sound you have to keep volume more than 50, lower volume less than 15 is not audible, this things slightly disappointed to me. Overall product is superb for this price range.
Thanks Amazon...",4
"I have tried different soundbar before confirming on this. Amazing quality and perfection to build product.

If you want to buy soundbar don't go just for soundbar, look for woofer and 5.1 speakers, collaboratively that produce amazing sound. you can choose any manufacturer after that.

I have tried all variant of boat, this is much better.",5
"One month review.

This product is not up to mark. We buying home theater to hear best sound. But in this case very disappointing from sony. Main issues is bass is strictly average. I tried from tv, setup box, bluetooth, usb, analog and optical. Everything is working but average performance. For some dolby sound movies are ok to watch but still overall products performance is very poor.

Quick delivery by Amazon.
Product pakage seems slightly ugly and its opend pack. But Inside speakers are ok.

Installation and Demo from Sony authorised service center done by K.G. Electronics Coimbatore. Excellent.

Additionally the surround speaker wire length is only 8 meter. Only fit for 10x10 room size. As per sony policy you cannot extended the wire length, which is also void your warranty.",1
"It's just been a day and it's very impressive already. The product is sleek, neat, stylish as well and omg!! so loud.
For normal usage speaker volume of 35-45 is more than enough and anything more than that gets too loud. We tested it with full vvolume in a closed room and the sound quality was great. No distortion of sound even at fullest volumes. Using the product with amazon basics optic cable. Will post updates as and when I get any issue or feel somethings good. So far so good. In love with the product and the best to buy in this price range. üòç",5
"My first home theatre,
first day feedback
Very fast delivery by Amazon.
My TV not have HDMI ARC and OPTICAL port,Hence I connected with Airtel DTH optical port to my home theatre.
Sound output: very soft and clear sound,bass is enough,but surround
speakers sound volume found very low,I need to check my settings in detail.
Value for money.remote function & feature satisfactory, overall good product.",5
"I just updated my review here. I was raised a complaint about surround sound effect to sony customer service. They agreed to send technician but no body came till now to check that issue.
First of all, Thanks to Amazon to give extended time frame to return the product but that is not used. I believe Sony will send technician and will help me to rectify the issue. But that is not happened :(
Likes:
Design, Quality of the product, Satelite speakers wire length and sound clarity.
Dislikes:
1) Product packing is not good. I received a product which looks like repackaged. My dislikes starts from that moment onwards... :)
2) Satelite speakers sound is very low. I did not feel the real cinematic surround sound as they advertised. It works like 3.1 channel output not 5.1 ch. Verified with high quality audios with BT, USB and HDMI connectivity. No difference. As I check with Sony service center, they said it might be a setting issue. Will come to my home and fix it next couple of days. Will check and update after fixing the settings issue.
3) Sony gave 20 feet length for Satelite speakers which is really good but wire are very thin and may cut if you pull the wire forcefully by mistake while doing setup.
4) Satellite speaker wire is not flexible for wall mount setup because we cannot bring the wire inside wall as speaker wire molded with the bin which can not remove it so I setup outside wall which looks awkward the interior design.. Sony must consider this in feature.",3
"I bought it amidst of all hypes. Got it for 13.5K in July 2020 after discount. But believe me, it's not worth keeping. Even my previous experience with intex 2600 w can compete with such sound quality.
Bass is OK, but clarity is on the downside even with all recommend procedures like placement, HDMI cable etc. No surrounding sound at all, Sony representative blames the quality of audio even from hotstar, prime , jio saavan etc. Yes movies from Netflix does have a better experience. So expect it to do magic only when you watch Netflix. Else my advice... Don't go for it",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Seems to be Quality Control Issue or refurbished product sent by Appario Retail. Didn't expect this from Sony and Amazon.
On unboxing and testing the home theatre, surround right speaker was found to be defective. It was not outputting any sound and when the unit was shaken, something was wobbling inside making noise (Video Attached). Waiting for replacement from Amazon now...

Apart from that, this is my initial review, there are no tweeters in this system and you'll feel that high frequencies are little low in this system. Adding to that, there is no equaliser option to crank high frequencies up, you are stuck with some presets which don't help that much. If you have equaliser in audio source device, you can adjust the high frequencies to get a balanced output out of this system.",2
"An absolute steal at this price! (14,989/-) Bravo Sony for bringing your prestigious and reputed home theatre range at an Indian budget ! Also the placement of the speakers count! It's a 5.1 channel speaker set so seek professional help for the best experience ! Use HDMI ARC for the best experience.",5
Speakers are not working at left side...worst packaging without Amazon packaging...seal is broken while received....looks like they sent a refurbished product..,1
"I didnt expect this from sony. As I am a sony fan ,i may think that any product from sony we can buy it blindly , but this is the exception for it, the sound is very loud as per its wattage , but were as its comes to bass it disappointed me very much ,yes ofcourse it shakes my windows and doors but in a very harsh way ,it don't fill the room the bass is not upto the mark as per my past experienced some audio products.5.1 channel sound is also missing you wont get any feel of 5.1 surround sound it works like a single loud speaker with a poor bass quality sound.
for
loudness -8/10
5.1 channel -3/10
bass quality -3/10
Bluetooth - 8/10
Aux - 5/10 (sound is reduced in this mode) .
I return this product to save my money thanks for Amazon.",1
"If you are currently using a 2.1 system i will definitely suggest this beast. This will convert your living room into a theater. Actually after playing musics you can identify some voices and sounds that you havent ever heard in that song which we missed since years. Sound is having crystal clarity and the Bass is deep and clear at any higher levels. Also the thing is fully black which gives a professional and royal look and will simply change the entertainment system to a new look.

No annoying lights or displays.(u can turn off the display)

You can update the system using software downloaded from sony website in pendrives

But one nd only sad thing is that bluetooth connectivity looses Bass for songs compared to other inputs.

To get the true experience u should i repeat you should place the speaker system as we see in the ads. Otherwise the rear speakers will seems like dummies.

And finally for an impression just play "" Dobly atmos Unfold"" trailer. Then you will have no doubt about value for money.",5
"I feel that the volume is not great. I need to go to 50 to hear the same volume which I get on 25 on my TV speakers.
I will check more and will update if there are any options to change it. Woofer is good.

Overall its ok. But not great.",3

 //Lets first talk about the sound. It is as good you can expect from a soundbar home theatre. The vocals are crisp,never overpowered by bass. Bass is just the right amount. Bassheads will be dissapointed for sure but for them we have 'B0AT'. Highs are great but doesnt have that sparkle like nearfield speakers (should not expect btw) .
//***One thing I love about this product is how many customisation options Sony give you. So dont forget to tinker with the settings in menu. Unlike other offerings in this budget you get options to customise the bass, surround speaker distance, their sound level and a ton more good stuff.***
// If you want to use this at low volumes like at night, dont forget to turn on DRC. If you watch a lot of Stereo Sound contents then you can turn off the surround speakers and only use them for the surround movie experience.",5
"It's a decent product at this price. Though, it's a 400w system, you can only feel the loudness when using it higher volume (preferably 70% and above). Below that range, the sound feels dull for a system of this configuration.

Pros:
Build quality is awesome.
All modes of connectivity options (except NFC)
Sound clarity (specificall, the dialogues clarity while watching movies)
Terrific sound at higher volume ranges.

Cons:
Rear satelite speakers are not loud enough
Low volume ranges are not much punchy
Subwoofer bass is just adequat",4
"I brought my Sony HT- S20R and when the Installation guy came installed the home theatre system, the ARC was not working and he said it's the problem of my TV ARC. My TV was new and supported arc Hisense 4k 55 inches but he convinced me to buy optical cable which I did by paying him 600 rupees but once he left I googled and tried by own and it worked with changing the menu settings on the Sony Home theater system, now I'm able to control my Home theater system with the TV remote and everything works fine but Sony he cheating people with selling extra items without any reason.",1
Worst and defective product received from Amazon and Amazon didn't replace the item saying it's not their fault... Saddened by service and quality.. plz don't buy from Amazon,1
"Nothing like 400w rms....slightly better than my 24w creative sbs..that costs rs.1200üòÄüòÄ... Sony, dont make us fool with 400 or 600 rms etc...",1
"Received the item on time with good packing. Unboxing is bit tricky. First I couldn't find the warrenty card and power cord, thought they are missing. They were placed very much inside so search for the items properly. Installation is easy
Coming to the performance its awesome the sound is crystal clear with superb bass. Place the small speakers at right positions then only you will feel the surround sound. Use only HDMI cable in ARC slot for better sound output
Onve again Thanks Amazon for the superb product.",5
"Won't be disappointed if you really know what you would get at this price point after reading all the reviews.

Remote functions are really easy to use and works perfectly with Sony Bravia T.V.TV connected to soundbar via HDMI ARC and I just need the T.V remote to control volume.Bass,Treble is just perfect.
Sound quality is largely dependant on the TV content played.
Sony service is very good and trustful.In case of any problems,the service personnel are extremely helpful.",5
"Nice Look.
Very good remote.
in Box : Remote, HDMI Cable, Ox Cable. Power Cable.
over all good.

 When you purchase a TV sometime it is not sufficient for us to digest the sound from the TV. The option will come to Sound bar or Home Theatre Systems. Considering for a 5.1 it will be some what costly. Here we have Sony HT S20R..
The budget friendly 5.1 Surround Sound bar System for Sony.

I purchased this product on 9th Mar 2021 and received by 14th Mar 2021 for a price of Rs. 14990/-.
After I purchased the product, i just waited for 1 or 2 days for the call back from Sony for Installation, but no information.
Then I just login to Sony website and booked for a demo and Installation for the product by myself.
Within 2 days they came and explained me everything related to the product and setup the connections for demo.

A traditional 5.1 system with Front Channels integrated in Soundbar and Surround Speakers having wires as normal.

Power Output:
L/R/Centre/SL/SR - 67W (4ohms 1kHz)
Subwoofer 65W (4ohms 100 Hz)

PROS:-
Easy Plug and Play
Good Sound Output
Easy to Use Remote Control
6"" Subwoofer
HDMI (Arc), Bluetooth (5.0), Optical Connectivity.
Easy Control for Subwoofer Volume in Remote.

CONS:-
LED Display in Subwoofer having small Screen, difficult to go through Menu.
Channel Separation is poor when comparing with other high end budget products (in HDMI).

But, for this budget, i suggest you to please opt for this product and it will not disappoint you.
For Rear Speaker Mounting i have purchased a product from Amazon itself (shown in images). The product name is SAFWE ‚Äì SM-02 - Speaker Wall Mount Stand.

Other Points to note:
1. The wire length of Surround speakers is around 8meters only (mentioned in Document).
2. For Best 5.1 results connect the system in HDMI or Optical Input.
3. This device supports Bluetooth 5.0 capable to connect all latest Bluetooth models.
4. No HDMI or Optical or Analog Cable is provided in the Box. It has 3.5mm cable for connecting which is available in the box.
5. No additional speakers can be connected.
6. Rear speakers can be mounted on wall (keyhole is provided).
7. You can opt for free demo and installation from Sony from their website.
8. No Support for Radio.
9. Do not cut the wire for extending, as it will affect the sound quality and more important, it will void your warranty.
10. The Surround speakers should be placed to the sides of your seats and a little bit above your ear level, for better surround sound.
11. You have an option to check the surround test with ""T TONE"" in the product, helpful for checking the effect.
12. Do not place Wi-fi Modem adjacent to the product, which will affect the audio quality (interference) while playing in Bluetooth.
13. PLEASE READ THE USER MANUAL BEFORE DOING ANYTHING. (Available from Sony Website).

Thanks

All speakers should connect through cable to the sub-woofer
Might have to provide detached cables for surround speakers

 This is my second review with in week. Iam facing lot of problems this home theatre system , it's automatically hanging ,there is some beep sound coming from sound bar, and connectivity issues I attached Video file about beep sound. finally I dont like it ...sound bass volume not upto the mark
you feel theatre experience you have increase volume more than 60 then you can feel some bass experience . Below 60 it's like tv sound .. my suggestion don't buy it. Sony customer service is ok but this product is not upto the mark....",5
"I was very very enthusiastic buying this one at 13,499 with a limitation like no ARC/optical out from my TV. Only hope was Firetv stick bluetooth out. But after setup i got really really disapointed with the blietooth output from Firetv stick 4k. It was like very very ordinary sound woth big bass. No clarity of treble and bass. I dont know it was due to bluetooth output, but do not buy if you do not have ARC or Optical out.",2
"Am writing this review after one week of usage. Got this on prime day sale for 13500.

Pros:
1) Best Home theatre System below 15K.
2) Sound quality is too good in this price range.
3) Accurate connectivity via Bluetooth.
4) System gives the best Sound quality even with Aux connectivity.
5) You will get the best Sound quality with Bluetooth,HDMI ARC,Optical and AUX respectively.
6) USB input to play mp3 files.
7) HDMI ARC Support.

Cons:
1) Lot of Wire Management required.
2) Provides only AUX cable with the box. Optical cable and HDMI cable to be buy separately.

Overall Verdict:
Guys just go for it if you are looking for a home theatre system below 15K. It gives best sound output with all inputs. Bluetooth or HDMI ARC are first choice of connectivity. Even Aux won‚Äôt disappoints you. Do not go for any 2.1 channel setup if you have the budget of 15K. I even tried JBL SB 160 in this range but this is cool. This is SONY Boss it will never disappoints you.

Note: Make sure your HDMI cable version is 2.0. Then only ARC will work.",5
"It's got good bass with surrounding sound which will work only of you have connected it using either a good optical or HDMI cable. There are good handy features like voice and night mode. Look wise it's a beautiful piece. Overall it's a good product but there are some cons also.

Cons:
1. Wire length for surround speakers is too short. You will never be able to place speakers in same direction as suffering by sony.
2. There's no option to set treble so you csn set tones as per your music taste. But it's okay if you prefer high bass.
3. No sound whatsoever when volume is set to 40 and below.

Sony - people buy this system for surround effect but what's the use if surround speakers can't be placed at right place because of short wire length.",4
The sound quality is really amazing at this price point . I have the Bose sound bar for the main hall and brought this for a bedroom setup and the volume output is average for movie viewing which is perfect for a small bedroom . But the Bluetooth mode has much louder output and very good bass. This has more bass than the Bose sound bar which is very impressive and the sound quality is also very comparable . For this price point it didn‚Äôt get any better than this .,5
"Excellent Home Theater i would say. Aftet doing research on which product will be best in 5.1 dolby and dts supported homes theater on 20k price range i found this. I did search a lot for reviews on this product and found utterly satisfying.

Sound Quality - Excellent (Undoubtedly Sony)
Home theater experience - Awesome (Cinema Hall experience)
Built Quality - Excellent.

The only thing could have been better if sorround speakers wires were more in length.
Remote functionality - Could have been more user-friendly.",5
"Too worst experience. No dolby effect and Sound Quality too low.

so I will replace this product. k wait and watch.",2
"As this is my first home theater I cannot compare with others. Am using with my MI 4a. Am having a good sound experience at my home. Sound is great when connected with ARC Hdmi. But could only enjoy the good sound if movies played on OTT. For DTH it's just ok.
I took for 14,999 but guys jus wait for bank offers. If I would wait for 2days then I could get it for 11,999 from Amazon Compitator app.",4
The name is enough Sony!!!! It lives up to its name. It was a major upgrade for me from earlier 2.1 system. It‚Äôs easy to install though the smaller surround speakers need some work to be installed as they are wired and need to be installed slightly away from main soundbar and woofer. The installation is simple. I am using Bluetooth to connect the fire tv with the system and it works flawlessly. You need to do some settings in the menu to get quality output from the surround sound speakers. Sound is awesome! You can set the sound level you want from the surround sound speakers. They are supposed to be installed behind the listeners to give the effect however the wires are just enough for a medium size room. Bluetooth connectivity is good. Overall I am happy with the purchase.,5

 After thorough research, I finally ended up buying Sony. Earlier, I was thinking of buying Bose or Yamaha but after analysing factors like ROI and usage, I finally decided to buy this model of Sony. I am a brand loyalist of Sony. Even I was using Sony phones till recently just because of its crystal clear Music.

About the delivery and item:

It was delivered on time but there were some minor scratches were found as it was not packed under additional carton. So, I applied for replacement and it got replaced very next day. I am so happy at the delivery front of Amazon always.

About the product:

I installed it myself as it was easy. There are five input modes :
1) USB - Any USB drives you can connect
2) BT - Bluetooth connectivity is superfast
3) TV- HDMI Arc.
* I tried connecting it in all the 3 HDMI ports of my TV indeed HDMI 2 has mentioned ARC but unable to connect it.
4) TV-Optical
*There is neither optical nor HDMI ARC cable is provided inside so you have to get it om your own. There is slight difference in the output of Bluetooth, HDMI ARC and optical.
You will get best results in Bluetooth and HDMI.

About the subwoofer:

Best in class.",4
"Reviewing after one month of usage.
Once product is delivered, Authorised person from sony came and stamped the warranty card and also helped in wall mounting the speakers.

Regarding product: the sound and bass is really excellent. But only issue is that they did not provide HDMI ARC cable with it (with provided analog 3.5mm jack sound quality is not that great). So if you want great quality sound, you have to buy it seperately.",5
"Exelent Product,

"The worst part is below 50, it's as bad as your TV sounds. Beyond 50 it works better. Now the 2 speakers are preety useless given that the front 3 ones work great, you will get all the sounds from it and the surround sound is minimalistic but it's there. At high volume 75 odd is when you will experience this home theater but by then you are sure to annoy your neighbours. Sound quality can be a lot better too.",4
"Sound quality is average. It does work for the given money. Bluetooth connectivity is great, only stereo though. I couldn't connect the Fire TV stick directly with this. Seems the ARC & CEC is not supporting Fire TV. Other soundbars does. It claims that it supports dolby digital, couldn't test as there isn't any support for the Fire TV. Only stereo audio produced through optical. 5.1 channel only works with ARC, nothing else. I contacted Sony, no support from Sony service.",4
Straight away go for Sony RT3 if u can spend 3-4k more...it gives proper surround sound... HT s20r is more like a general speaker-woofer...effect of surround is poor. Chanel seperation for the rear speakers is poor. If its a small room(around 13'x16') it will do the job....5 stars for the sound quality. 1 star for the surround. No return..so shifting it to bedroom.... living needs better sound.,3
"The first thing that came into my mind when I look at the package was it's already used and damaged one. As expected all the items are dislocated. Pouches, thermocol supports were torn and broken. Then I tried to install and play some music. The connectivity is good and also the output was great but you need to put the volume up to 60. Otherwise, your TV speakers would give more sound than the sound system. The satellite speakers are barely useful. They are just normal stereo ones. The overall experience made me lose the trust on Amazon that we might not get brand new items every time. Have returned the item and got a refund.",3
"The system was delivered in perfect condition and on time. It was easy to setup with all cables and speakers. All featy work as expected. I connected using an optical cable.

Sound is good , but not extraordinary. It lacks a bit clarity on the mids. You would feel a little bit of hollow sorround bass more than the vocals.

One negative point is it does not have a trebble control. Bass control works fine from remote.

Overall, if possible do a sound test at a showroom a d don't discount unknown brands , cause sometimes they sound better than branded ones.

I had a intex 2.1 system earlier whcih was way less expensive and sounded mostly similiar ifnot better. This does look better but does not justify the15k cost.

I assume the service part is also a plus. Sonny folks visited after purchase and did a demo.",4
"Sound quality is awesome. Great customer service.

I was not expecting a demo to happen, but was delighted when the person called in and indicated it was included. they can even take care of the wall mounting during this demo (but it needs to be informed before hand).

The person who came for the demo (Jignesh) provided a detailed walkthrough of the set up and usage. He even indicated the advantages of connecting via the optical cable vs other modes and gave several other tips. Increased the volume on all the speakers to result in an awesome surround sound effect.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 This product of sony company is soo poor
Bluetooth connectivity is soo bad
Sound quality is poor
Bass quality is not soo good
Do not purchase this product",1
"Worth spending money ..... great product at this price.
No other product is available in this market at price band of 15 K.
Either you spend 40 K above in Yahama, Yamo etc like brand to get same level of sound quality
Only cons is that length of speakers are design to 10X10 room size",5
Installation team is very good in explaining the features and installed the product in professional way.Thanks to SONY Team for the same.,5
"Hello everyone.
Writing this after 2 days of usage. Since this is my first purchase of soundbar I totally satisfied with this product. I will recommend you to buy this if your budget is below 15000.
It delivers sound with clarity and deep bass. For ease I mention its special features as keypoints

* Touchsensing buttons on the subwoofer
* a Small display on the subwoofer
* Adjustable bass
* Sleek remote control
* Analog input where you can connect your phone (cable comes along with the system) (3.5 mm jack)
* Various modes with Dolby support

Really Happy about the purchase... : )",4
"Product is awesome...

For me, Optical digital cable is not delivered, i don't know why?",4
See first mistake that I have done was I was comparing Sony sound to onkyo system . I was earlier using onkyo sound thought this Sony home theater must sound better than onkyo but I was wrong . Onkyo was far away better than this one . But my onkyo was 10 year old one so when compared with this new Sony system this one is far away better when compared technology wise . But sound onkyo is better .,4
"A long long wait to buy my first Home Theatre came true with this. There is no need for a special certification for Sony. The Demo guy came and unleashed the beast in my HT. Terrific experience it was.

For anyone who has doubts about the performance of this HT, I will say ""Blindly buy this"". You will not regret. Handling by Amazon was good....and swift too..

Overall...it was a happy purchase",5
"Product is good, if not exceptional. Provides decent sound and base via HDMI ARC & Bluetooth.

The sound bar turned out to be smaller than expected. Photos can be deceptive. It measures 76 x 9 x 5 cm.

Demo & installation is provided by Sony at no additional cost. You can call Sony customer care if you don't receive a call.",4
"Sub woofer is not that powerful for music listening if you want thumping/deep bass. Sound from soundbar and
surround speakers are very good but hissing sound can be heard while playing music,might be manufacturing defect.
Connectivity -5 *
Sound Quality-
(1)Voice- 5*
(2)Bass-3.5*
Best part is got at 12,600 inr during Republic day sale",4
"Our room was 17by 10 and it‚Äôs an awesome addition.
This higher Watt recommendation is as you connect with 5.1 output the sound is low and if its normal analog is sufficient. Prefer to Buy 1000W as it's a single time buy.
You need to buy the Audio Digital output cable separately.(Would be happy if it's given in the box)
As the installation persons also didn't carry one to buy and had to wait long to get one and connect it myself.",5
"Nice product, I got this for Rs14500. Thanks to Amazon Divali sale nd SBI 10% cash back offer.

Coming to this sound bar with 5.1 channel, 400 W sound..

Its more than enough for a room size of 12 x 18 feet. 50% of 400W sound itself giving Theatre effects with huge sound with super high quality.

And for Bass lovers it may bit disappointing as these products will produce Bass suitable for home..",5
"Crystal clear sound with recent bass. This is probably because i have fixed the system in medium sized room and not in the hall. Moreover for surround i have met the satellite speakers in in opposite 2 corners of the room.

Installed by myself. Because of inceasing corona cases didn't allow installation team to come. So far everything is good.",5
"Sony build quality and sound performance, never turned me down, I'm already having Sony Smart TV, and Sony Headphones WH-1000XM3, one of the best sound quality. The soundbar is really good. Deducting one star, as the AAA batteries were not in the box, as they have mentioned in the product description. Also, they should be giving an HDMI ARC cable along with the home theatre. If company is providing their own make of the cable, it will be useful, otherwise, in the market there are many HDMI cables, which either doesn't work or are not compatible.

Overall a good experience with these 5.1 channel soundbar home theatre in this price range.",4
I got defective product. When i connect bluetooth and play for a 10 min after 10 min sounds gets crackling (like something is burning inside the box) on every speakers. I always trust sony but this time happened something else. Immediately i returned it. But thanks amazon Refunded entire money within 1-2 days. Sound system was good it has decent bass and clear sound perfect for a small to medium room.,2
"Great product as usual from Sony, value for money during the Amazon sale. Only wish a HDMI ARC cable was included as part of the package. Had to buy one separately since that's a must else you settle for lower performance but more expensive S/PDIF (again cables and adapter need to be purchased separately) or Bluetooth.",5
"Awesome purchase, as usual sony is always committed to deliver quality.

The installation service is also well in time by Shri Narender, his behaviour is really humbly and polite.

There is a specific point of mentioning regarding the behaviour because earlier to Shri Narender, some Mr Govind has arrived for the installation service but his behaviour was absurd rather humiliating which makes you feel that the customer is always dishonest. He will make you feel a petty customer who does not know no about such products and there procedures, he boast for the Sony brand logo printed on his t-shirt which he does not deserve at all. Mr Govind was least concern for my time schedules and priorities. He was annoyed with me for attending phone call of my family.

Anyways this Home theater is really a treat for ears.",5
It is not even 4 months and one of the Surround Port is not working. My old basic 5.1 speaker of Philips worked for almost 7 years without any issues and still works. I did not expect such an experience with Sony. I wish the Service Center has an option to fix it.,1
"When connecting audio from Bluetooth or analog then the sound volume is good. But as optical input is connected in 5.1 channel TV input then immidiately sound becomes 50% less. To see movie in 5.1 sound the I have to do volume at 100%.
Is anyone else is also feeling low volume in 5.1 TV input mode.",4
"firstly I was a bit disappointed because of it's soundbar size nd it Bass , more over it is not connecting to my Moto tv through HDMI arc , I could not hear any surround effect , so Ive decided to return it .
But then I've made up my mind for a last try n bought a high end quality HDMI cable online n connected , finally the HT is working through HDMI arc , later I've downloaded movies which has DD 5.1 Channel audio output , then the result was BOOM .",4
Awesomeüëèüòä Soundbar by sony i have used sony old home theater system of 10k before buying these and ohhhhhh these blows my mindüòè had an thumping bass it shakes all my window after settling up the volume of subwoofer at 12 and soundbar volume at just 50 (max upto 100) but if you are living in a flat then you are just able to increase volume upto just 50 after that you will get complain from neighborhood ü§£‚úåüèª so go for it don't think sony is the best company best delivery thanks to seller ‚ò∫ and it is very easy to Install it by your own no need to call any professional ‚ò∫‚úåüèªi am giving these review after using it 5-6 days and also i have tried at maximum volume its very clear also at max,5
"Blutooth is good.
Sound quality is best.
Bass is enough.

But...
I have given 4 stars because the length of rear speakers(rear left & rear right) wires are not sufficient as both has 20feet lengths respectively.

If it is 15metres length, it will be enough to use this best sound system in (hall)Living room...

Because cutting speakers wire and extension is not adviceable as sound quality may decrease Or life of the sound system may decrease...
If all wires are lengthy, they can be easily Concealed in walls...

Best product in 15k rate...",4
"Sound quality is good but one issue is low volume output... Sometimes you won't hear anything if volume is less than 40. Not sure we will get any software update for the same.
PS: If the provided satellite speaker wire length is not enough don't cut and join, it will lead to void your warranty.",4
I am a big fan of Sony products.. but in this case the sony company disappoint me gor installation purpose... They called us without any prior notice n suddenly told us that they r coming for installation... That time no one was at the home... We asked for change the timing.. they were so rude they disconnected the call... Very much disappointed,3
"Sound quality is very poor you can hear only bass and mid voice poor high freq perfomance, bass quality is ok on volume above level 50, below that my tv volume is better. For given high price we will get better perfomance from brands like zebronics and boat etc. Surround sound is ok on high quality videos. Rear speaker wire length is short for my 12 ft width hall.",2
"This is my first review of any product in Amazon. It was my dream to buy a Sony home theatre. I went a step ahead with the affordable sound bar fir 15990. I was looking to buy 600W sound bar, since our hall is quite small I was contended with 400W. But seriously you don't find much difference. Coming to the quality of the sound bar, I was amazed with the sound quality especially the basss from the subwoofer is just brilliant whether you play a song or a movie even the little minute sound details are crisp. The sound from the two rear speakers are little low but that is very negligible infront of the main speakers. The final verdict: If you are looking a sound bar in 15-20K range, this is the one",5
"Very affordable and adequate for domestic use. Nice and elegant looks. Practical in use. What I dislike is controlling the menu features through remote control is very difficult. You cannot see menu display on TV and you have to refer manuals every time. Menu items which appear in sound system display in short forms are not easy to remember. This is why I did not understand for long many of the features which aew available. Apart from these, it's a great sound system for home.",4
"There's no doubt on the product quality in terms of build and aesthetics. The touch sensitive controls on the sub-woofer is amazing. BUT, sound? Dont expect heart-thumping sound from this system. SONY HT S20R mentions 400W. Dont be fooled to think it is 400 RMS. I have multimedia speakers from JOHN BARREL (200 RMS) which ironically has a heart-thumping sound and costs half the amount. The SONY HT S20R is targeted for somebody who loves Sony's signature sound (balanced high/low/mids) wherein the sound does not crackle even in high volume.",2
"Sound quality of the system is Good but not the Best. Bluetooth connectivity is good, there is no loss of signal. Build quality is very nice and sleek. Sound effect of sub woofer is just awesome... Overall Sony is Best in sound systems.

I request Amazon to direct the sellers to deliver the package in a good box, coz which box i recd was in a very dirty condition.",5
"Product performance on Bluetooth is excellent. Sound and Bass quality are also good but, the surround speakers are not that much effective, which was expected. Very low volume is heared from surround speakers even after raising volume by to 12 (full).",4
"WoW and Amazing are the words to describe the sound quality and the clarity of these speakers. Great job done by Sony by providing these sorrund speakers. This is of the reasons sony is one the of the pioneer's in Audio industry.
This is a must buy for all the music and movie fans who wants to feel a true cinematic experience in a medium budget.

And sony tech did an outstanding job by installing the speakers. They made the experience even better. Kudos to everyone good job guys",5
"Execellent surround sound. If you want loud music simple switch the input to PCM from dolby in TV settings.

In offer got it for 12.5k. Good looks decent channel separation. Quality and clear audio.

Other options at this price are zebronics pro 9400 and boat. But most of them are unavailble.

Bass is also good enough too.",5
"For everyone complaining that the satellite speakers aren't loud enough
You have to use 5.1 supported content for them to work as expected, you morons.
Most of the HD channels, and all of OTT is mostly 5.1 these days.",5
"Received damaged product where it is already having dammage on the right side of subwoofer.

Found 2 NIPPON batteries inside remote instead of sony branding batteries which are not supposed to be inserted in remote already.

Package was not satisfactory, found tampered already used and again returned by someone.",1
"Just sony brand name...nothing impressive...sound quality and bass ok ok.

Satellite speakers sound is very low.

Till 30 volume it is not even audible...

Get lots of options for 15k....",3
"Value for money... The best 5.1 HT system under 15k available in the market.. I've gone through jbl, philips, f&d but this one is just lit. So happy and satisfied with the product. Thank you SONY and Amazon. Early delivery of the product.. Good works from amazon. The only think which I didn't think is good the packaging of the product, could have done better. Product is safe and sound.",5
Sony always üëçbest. It's value for money and Sony is also providing free demo and installation service for it. Good sound quality with good bass but only problem when you see movie if voice is below 30 then you will not hear anything you have to increase the voice level. For listing musice with good bass is good at this price. Recommend it for Sony brand and good service. Thanks to Amazon for 2 days delivery to my location and Sony for installation and demo service.,4
"The sound bar gives adequate sound and just OK bass. So need to be sure of ur requirement prior to going for purchase. For music freaks, NO!! For home users, May Be!!

My problem has been with the serviceability of the set. It became unserviceable in the very first month. Had to be repaired through Sony Service centre. That too with lot if delay....",2
I have received a replacement product today... I have clicked pictures which has a small hole on the product... Product is working good.. I have no complaints in the product.. But when I received the item I got slight damage on the outer cover which looks bad.. I will continue with the same product but I need some refund for this damage.. I expected the call as I have send the details today itself as I have received your product today... Please check my account iam a good customer for amazon... Iam feeling bad why the costly items are not taken care.. Awaiting for your reply,4
Sound quality is amazing and justified with this price range. One more thing to mention here that Sony is providing one time free installation with this product. Sony service engineer Mr. Jitendra Yadav came for installation and he installed the 5.1 chennal setup perfectly. Now we are enjoying movie like a theatre on our big screen tv.,5
"Worst worth less product, product is nort working properly from 3 months of purchase there is no proper services,no connectivity,no customer service support,no proper technician,from January to now it is may same problem persists,inspite of calling many times I didn't get any resolution for my problem,who are in hyderabad dont buy the product 16000 waste of money, literally pouring money in drain. They don't have proper technicians.",1
"Product is worth for money.
Sound quality is truely wonderful.
Dolby digital is awesome. I watched dolby trailer of marvel's avengers and it was felt like i m in theatre.
Bass is also above average.
At this price range of below 15000.
It is best in class.
Recommended without any doubt.
And the installation n demo is quick and responsive.",5
"Super baas
Hdmi arch connectivity with mi tv is excellent
5.1 works only with hdmi arch and hd vedio content
As per cost sony is giving less
For more features but you have to pay more",4
"At the rage of price this was best product and this was more than enough for home needs... after habituated with this system, you will get irritation to here direct sound from your TV due to loud sound.",5
"I was returned this product....
Because of this is not dolby product, it's pure ordinary speakers. It's not worth full more than 1500/-rupees.
I did not heard the songs more than 2 mints through bluetooth.
Very very hard to hearing the music through bluetooth. That's why I'm returned this whole pack.",1
"I bought a sony HT-S 20R. Today Mr Vishal Kharva came at my home from Shree Parshwa services Alkapuri, for installation and demo. He installed my hts and give me full demo, I am fully satisfied with his work, great service. Thanks.",5
Perfect for small size room,5
"Weather you want to use it for listening music for watching movie or for watching regular TV you will experience the signature sound of sony which is the best in its range.
Sounds extreamly well and certainly makes your living room a theater.
If your budget is allowing you then definitely go for it without a second thought.",5
"Please go for some higher models than it as it have good bass , good function.But while using it under 20 volume you will not able to hear the vocals clearly . You can go for some higher model like tall boy of Sony . They are best than this .BTW home theatre is superb in high volume .",3
"The sound quality no doubt Sony is much better as the name is.
Purchased on big billion sale at rs15570.

Satellite speakers can be connected but not required for small room. Technician from Sony came for demo and installation which was not expected. Good service provided.",4
Overall very good product under the budget of 15k.. Bass is not up to the mark but voice of the music is very clear. L& R speaker's wire is large not recommend to attach extra wire if required.. because warranty will be lost if we do that.,5
"Remote control superb,Bluetooth Connectivity Good, and atlast Sound quality is good And U feel like a Theater while watching movies with This, Surrounding sound is awesome,But only when volume is above 80 in remote control,While listening to the music Bass Quality is not much loud than i Expected from sony brand, Coming to that point I totally disappointed...Voice is fully clear Cristal...",3
"It's a premium product, as expected from a brand like sony. Decent for a mid size room. Very strong bass. Top end vocals could be higher but it's still good.
Installation was provided by sony. Installation executive was knowledge and helped a lot in placing the speakers in the right place.",5
Amazon did a wonderful job in delivering the package in time. It was very well packed and did not endure any damage. First of all we were not sure how the product would be but azon surprised us. Not only is the product really good in its built but the sound quality is truly superb and is actually what you would expect out of a Sony product. Thank you sony India and Amazon for such an amazing product.,5
You can't just cluster the speakers together and expect surround sound. Google how to arrange a sound system. Generally a few of the speakers have to be at least two feet above ear level and at the edges of the room. Play around to find out what works for you. The product itself is too notch.,5
"After one week of. Usage, No problem found.
1. Best Sound quality
2. Fast Bluetooth connectivity
3. Overall performance The Best",5
A Good Home Theater; worth for the money. Thanks to Sony and Amazon for the product :),4
"there was two speakers, one sound bar , one woofer. Not used other two speakers as there was no need. It is good but unfortunately not able to connect to my TV. as model is quite old can recommend it if tv is not too old.",4
Good sounds,5
I really liked the sound quality of the system at this price. Good job done by Sony. One of the best sorround system at this price range available in the Market. Satisfied with the sound quality and overall performance of the Product.,4
"Upgrading from an old budget system, this system is a good all rounder with easy to set up wiring and easy to use features. Pairing with a TV that allows audio sync will eliminate your need for its remote and being a Sony product, build quality is unquestionably good. Package was delivered on time and with no damage to the exterior.",5
"I bought this system last week because I love music and music with Sony its like heaven, moreover Mr. Vishal Kharva who came behalf of Sony for Demo was so kind and help me lot to use this music system very smoothly. So thanks to Mr.Vishal & specially Amazon to send product before time. Thnaks a lot..........",5
Sound quality is the best and awesome experience with surround sound.. had very pleasant experience with installation service from Sony technician Mr.Vishal kharva from Shree parshwa services from alkapuri.. on time delivery and hassle free installation.. overall very good product..,5
The quality is good but the volume starts from 45 to hear the music. I suggest going for the next level Home theater in Sony. Service is too bad. Sony executive called me as said please check-in YouTube for more information and installation,3
Speakers work fine. Bass and sound are awesome. But doesn't work with third party HDMI ARC Cable. Every application of TV lags with this external HDMI Cable. Unable to listen even ten seconds properly. Don't buy if you wish to use it with HDMI and watch YouTube/Netflix. Good for others. Bluetooth works good,3
"Too much Delayed delivery. Sound quality is nice with deep bass but lacks high frequency response. High frequency is totally suppressed. To connect to TV, ARC cable is required which is not supplied with soundbar.",4
"Its been 6 months...
Sound quality is Awesome. The Bass is balanced and only thing is we can here the sound quality after increasing 45 level of volume",5
"Good material for medium value, everything (bass, surround) good ,more sound for optical cable. I suggest buy optical cable with home theatre",5
"Overall perfomance of this device is good.
I feel better experiance with this when it connected to our tv and watch dth pgm in dolby plus sound.",5
Nice sound quality. Fully smart,5
"It was superb. Sound quality is just amazing it is very loud and crystal clear sound with thumping bass. Very Happy with this product thanku sony , amazon and customer service is also good",5
"Good quality build and output.
Sound seems to be slightly towards bass, so you might miss high freq notes a little.",4
"No demo and installation service, after followup 100 times, sony customer care is useless, they are very much concerned about their company policy, no care of the cusneeds, after purchasing 3 days its lying with me like show pieces, useless, I tried as per the instructions manual and youtube, then also its not working no sound.",1
Deep bass and surround effect while watching movies makes me crazy . really i am satisfied with it . thanks to amazon specially because i got it by 13.5K using 10% discount on cibi bank credit card.,5
"Wonderful product at this price range..! Loving it.. Thank you Sony :)
Quality is amazing as always..!
Thank you Amazon for bringing this & Super fast delivery..",5
"Sound bar quality is excellent.
But disappointed with the subwoofer, bass is not upto Sony standards.
Bluetooth connectivity is excellent.
Audio quality is good in optical & hdmi than bt & analogue signal.
This model is worth for watching movies not for music lovers.",4
"Very nice bass, punchy. Subwoofer has separate volume control. Option to control left and right surround speakers. But the menu is little difficult to use.",5
"Sound power is below my expectation. But it is ok for my room. Sound is ok. Dolby effect is not much effect may i need to use hdmi or opical input. Presently using bluetooth

Any way i am enjoying the dystem. Very good experiance.",4
Its good bass was not much good and its value for money for big room its not suitable it is comptable for small and medium rooms and rare spekers wire was also so good and long to Large rooms upto 7 meters its good,4
Absolutely mesmerizing experience. You might get zebronics 9400 pro for a 1000 less but this will easily beat Zebronics. I'm a tech youtuber and so i can sense this quality. Please watch the review on my Youtube channel - Techknow Gyan Hub,5
"Bluetooth üëç
Optical üëç

But the volume has to be above 70 to have a good experience and the rear speakers add nothing to the sound output when u play audio files.overall a good product from sony.",5

Good Bass
Awesome Sound Clarity
Good Loudness",5

Con
The satellite speakers are not that loud. So don‚Äôt expect much surround effect",4
Product is excellent replaced once because of some connectivity problem. But issue resolved. Service is good. Service personal nainesh from shree paswa service Vadodara installed it.,5
Good Product and Good after sell service as Mr.manubhai Patel from sunrise service came for a demo of product and it was a great experience. Just a suggestion if you can add an HDMI cable with it will be great.,4
"I'm using it with my MI TV. Connected using HDMI ARC. Excellent sound quality in 10x10 room/hall. If your hall/room is bigger, this product might not be much efficient. In such case, you can buy 600 watts or 1000 watts system depends upon your needs.",5
"HDMI Arc not working, after 2 hours and display not working after 20 days. Technician received my warranty card but no response, no repair",1
Yesterday i received and installed this item. I am very satisfied with this overall performance. The surround speakers cable lengths are 6 meters only which are suitable for 10 x 10 rooms only.,4

Pathetic and very disappointing experience. We got it replaced once as it was lagging and then now we had to give it back to Sony as it has issues with Bluetooth connectivity and again lagging too.,1
Amazing product bass is superb loved it,5
Got a call from Sony immediately once I received the product. Excellent sound quality even at low level volume. Even though arc port was not available in my tv analog does the job.,5

Product is very good awesome bass and sound clarity even in 90 percent volume is great..... Perfect for home thrater only one concern treable quality is below average other than that at 15k range go for it,5
Good but what ever i except bass and and sourrounding is not there. But Good sound and worth product from sony. Love it,5

No Resume function of USB.
Only reason to buy is company name.",2

"Ordered this in total Rs.13500 @ https://amzn.to/2CA3ia9 by availing 1.5k cashback offer.

Sony gives value for money product, especialy music related items. I always wanted to have Soundbar and Sony is realy best in class. Remote functions & features are good. Seamless Bluetooth connectivity.

Suitable for small, medium and large sized rooms. Sorrounding sound is simply perfect. When connected with Optical cable or HDMI ARC, 5.1 channel surround sound is like Awesome...!!!! I almost feel like PVR experience for Hollywood movies. Overall very good product and that too falls within my budget.

Few PROS and CONS after the user of couple of weeks.

Pros:
1. Nice sound quality
2. Prize is affordable.
3. Installation service is good.
4. Good for small, medium, large sized rooms.
5. Remote control seems basic but works perfectly fine.

Cons:
1. Through Aux-in cable, volume seems inaudible.
2. Bass effect could have been better.",4
"I bought this garbage from another online portal, and regretting like anything.

Pros:

Just one, brand name.

Cons:

1. Only after volume at 50, you get to hear better sound with clear beats. And you cant keep playing at these high volumes all the time.
2. Bluetooth mode does not support surround
3. Cable lengths are just 20 ft, and if u try to extend them u will void the warranty.
4. It cant produce those typical AR Rahman instruments, it just gives you dham dham sounds.",1
"This is one of the best soundbar at this price range.
I have lots of confusion for choosing good soundbar for me as in this range there are lot many options. Sony is the king in sound system so i haven't considered any other brand for soundbar but i have listened many soundbars in stores. Among all in general if we consider the 200 - 400 watt range then almost all soundbats like Boat Aavante 3100D, Samsung HW T550 any many other in this range is performing good, Samsung have options for wireless rear speakers, boat also providers good bass. So after searching lot i finally chose to go with SONY.

Then in Sony again confusion between Sony HT RT3 and Sony HT S20r.
Sony HT RT3 is a 600w system and Sony HT S20r is 400w system.
It is clear that more watt means more sound and more bass. Yes that's true but among all this stuff there are many factors affect for good sound effects like,
1. Size of room - If room size is more then more watt system required for proper effect. Sony HT S20r is perfect for upto 18 X 22 size room. No issue at all, No need to go for higher watt systems.
2. Input source quality - it is most important factor for good effect. Connect always with HDMI ARC only for good sound separation and effect. And input audio format is also most important. Like wav has good output then mp3 format.
3. Placement of speakers - always prefer to install system with experts, as they know good placement.

Now comparison between Sony HT RT3 and Sony HT S20r, my final conclusion is both are almost same at sound effects point of view. You can check with Store, for clear understanding. Don't compare by review video on YouTube, because in that video you can't hear proper sound with earphones also.
Sony HT RT3 have 5-6 % more bass and sound.
But Sony HT S20r is latest release so my choice is go for latest.
Trust me it won't disappoint you. Go for it. One of the best budget friendly systems.",5
"I have been using this for 3 months. Worth to but it. I have bought john barrel and Blaupunkt home theatre and returned it and I have tested more than 8 brands including Sony dav TZ145. I didn't satisfied. But this is best of all in this price range. Feels the original Dolby effect (not for local theatre effect with only bass, treble). Worth to buy it, if you are a real musical lover. Go for it.",5
"Awesome product in this price range... Actually almost reviews are absolutely wrong since many are not doing the proper settings which mentioned in the owners manual and even the technical team of stores doesn't have knowledge to configure the System with proper manner
Pros:
1)The System has the Complete configuration setting in menu
Surrounding speakers we can set accordingly by distance, Volume level by each and we should do the configuration according to the room size for better outcomes
2)Dolby digital is perfect and crystal clear if we set the all in menu
3)Have the sub woofer and system volume control seperatly
4)It has the decent sound with good bass and Dolby digital with supporting almost all digital formats
5)After doing the configuration the dolby is perfectly working even with you toube also and HD channels in the peak performance
6)Remote has almost all settings including we can control surrounding speakers through menu
7) surrounding speakers have 6 MTR each wire which is enough to fix proper places
8)HDMI ARC working perfectly with detailed Sound quality
Cons:
Overall nothing but remote has little lagg and some times hard to press
First 15 days I couldn't feel any good sound and I was about to return the product but later I understood the settings and it's works wonderfully... Sellers must arrange demo and installation with proper person who know the configuration which I didn't got from Reliance Digital and I was blamed Sony for the product initially

NOW I AM HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT SUPER IN CLASS... Recommend for budget customers but should do the proper configuration",5
"Very powerful soundbar from Sony. If you are experimenting with a Sound bar for the first time, this could be your likely option. In my 2 weeks experience, Bluetooth connectivity from music through mobile is amazing. The 400W speaker system offers a nice listening experience. Unable to connect with my MI TV yet and hence can't comment on HDMI feature. But definitely a worthy choice less than 15K",4
"First and foremost to all prospective buyers..DO NOT BUY this..Its the worst product SONY has ever made. A total disatisfaction to SONY customers. We expect a decent sound quality from SONY. I have been using SONY audio for more than 20 years now and recently replaced an old SONY with SONY HTS20R.
So my findings are
Volume is very very low
Sound quality is pathetic
Voice is unclear
Channel seperation is pathetic..its not a 5.1 at all ..just a 2.1 tweeked to sound like a 5.1 and SONY has failed
Bass is pathetic
Nothing is good except it look likes 5.1
Its just worth Rs5000
So PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY

Dr.Vinayaraj S",1
"For me it works perfectly in Bluetooth and while playing movies and songs... But due to my restrictions in television, when I hear songs in YouTube, the sound gets buffered to reach to speaker.

So better check for all compatablity before you opt for it.

But then satisfied with this since I don't often hear youtube songs in television.

Also there is no extra extension cables. Though they provide lengthy cables the lenght might not be sufficient to be set up to a living room which is of a little big width and hence need to cut it and put an extension wire (warranty cannot be claimed).

Beyond all of this it's still worthy of buying at such a price.",4
do not think just buy super quality badget price ...super bass is low but surround all super mini theater in house so dont mis I'm using 10 days I'm satisfied Thank you sony,5
"I was confused seeing the negative reviews but finally made up my mind to go for this one. This is the best value purchase I've made so far. You just beed to set the speakers at the right position (Soundbar just below your tv clamped to the wall, sub on floor and rear speakers not too high.) If you aren't planning to set up a 5.1 arrangement and are looking to set up the rear speakers, soundbar and sub close to each other then don't go for this one. Bang for every penny you spend.",5
"Some ppls mention that they are not satisfied with sony sound quality.
Trust me guys no brand in this world who can satisfied those ppl. Better u ppl dont purchase anything.",5

"overall this product is good. Will not get hdmi cable along with this, need to buy that separately. Aux cable is provided. Can't expect 5.1 experience with that for sure. Go with Amazon basics CL3 rated HDMI cable (under 500) or honeywell 2.1
HDMI cable (under 1500) to experience great sound quality. Cheers!",4
"EMI option is showing Bajaj Finserv EMI card but when I actually tried with it, I got a message that this payment options is not available.

 Don't confuse.. go for it. Super Duper Sony Dolby Digital sound. Highly recommended.

5 star- Sound quality is so great like Sony and Amazone. you can use any mode like music, Cinema, Voice, Night.. you feel can feel real Dolby Digital sound.

5 star- Bluetooth connectivity is super fast. its with in second connectivity means super lightning connectivity. I am shocked about bluetooth its is not 5.1 its 7.2 connectivity. So great.

5 star- Bass quality is equivalent like 50k soundbar.
In remote you can adjust bass from 1 to 12 volume. its not mentioned in photography or product details. Bass quality is mind-blowing. I am very happy..

this review is after using 5 days.
Highly recommended. I don't know why people said wrong thing about this product. Before purchasing i am so confused due to some reviews and so many enquiries i have been done.. but after purshase Highly recommend for all of you.",5

From sound bas will not able to seperate left and right side voice.

So you will not get that surround sound effects.",3

"I bought product when there was not any review available for this product. I ordered it thinking JBL will not disappoint me and i was true.

Before keeping this product i ordered thomsan soundbar, blaupunkt soundbar and boat one, returned all of them..they were not bad though. But i didn't want to compromise in audio quality.
This delivers what i needed, i. e. Correct frequency response. Some people complaining about low bass, let me mention it gives sound signature of JBL audio .it gives pure bass pleasant to ears not unnecessary booming like roadside dhoom dhadaka..i hope you understand what i am trying to say..i returned blaupunkt as the bass was extra boomy that ruins the melody of music..some people likes it but i don't. I prefer balanced sound signature. This delivers perfect bass response and the punch comes when it is needed..it is a mark of great sound signature..i can assure that after listening this even audiophiles will not complain. Maybe people who complaining about bass must replace their product, i am sure they got defective item.
It doesn't have bass and treble control feature but why someone need to disturb the sound signature by tweaking it. I don't feel any need, though it can be done with phone equalizer.
One addition - it has 3 equalizer preset modes present on remote. That works perfectly. game, music and cinema

Loudness is more than enough, i haven't played it at full volume as my windows started vibrating so i lowered it down. No one wants complains from neighbours.

Coming to build quality. It is perfect nothing to complain in this section.

It is the best one could get in this price range.
Usually i don't write reviews but i struggled a lot while ordering this unit as there was not a single review available for this, i hope this will help others a little bit.",5
"Sound quality of speaker is above average but the speaker itself comes with many cons and very high price.
CONS WHICH I AM MENTIONING ARE

1) Product description wrongly shows 100W powerful speaker but they are not, the 100W power is peak power but in actual these speakers are 50W(RMS)

2) Product description shows many important features of these speakers but i want to tell every buyer that bass is not tunable in these speaker, there is no key to tune bass of base speaker

3) Voice starts crackng after increasing the sound above 50 percent

4) These speakers do not comes with inbuilt FM , which i personally think is the basic features of all the speakers comes in this range

5) range of speakers is not good",1
"By no means Im an audiophile read review at ur own risk

Well I wanted a 2.1 system primarily for my PC and also with bluetooth to stream music from my phone.
i waited almost 6 months for logitech z337 ( i already own this one in other room. had got them for 3k in 2017 ) but sadly this time it wasnt available during the festive sale. so i kept searching and came across the INFINITY (jbl) system. well i was skeptical to begin with as this product had no reviews and was launched recently. The names JBL,INFINITY,HARMAN were enough to sell me out. as i owned a JBL home theater before i know the quality.
I gambled and went ahead and made the purchase,.,.and oh boy! u wont be disappointed, these are very good speakers.

Pros:
-Audio quality.,its clean and clear,,..,no distortion.,notes look good to me...,perfect for my PC.,,.the satellites and woofer are awesome!
- BASS .,.,its not annoying it hits the right spot!!!
-build quality
-easy to connect bluetooth or aux
- remote control is responsive.
-Brand value

Cons:
- no bass control knob provided on the woofer.,,.but i never felt the need to tone the bass down as its balanced.,.,
- i dont like it when good brands provide usb ports on their 2.1 systems looks cheap for me.,.but hey i guess the more connectivity options the better.
- the buttons console on the woofer feels .,,lil flimsy..
-cables a lil short.,.

CONCLUSION: Iam happy with the purchase and within this price range its a good deal!",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The bluetooth range of the product is very very pathetic. The small JBL speakers has better connectivity. I spent 8 hrs only in identifying the problem - realizing that the bluetooth don't have a range of few feet.",1
"I purchased this product reading reviews here and on youtube reviews also it had jbl and harman name associated with it.
So here is my experience .
I received my product on time but as soon as i opened box i noticed dent on subwoofer corner. I decided to ignore it as sound matters more to me so i connected speakers and tested on bluetooth and 3.5 mm jack connection . Tested on YouTube hd, Spotify and gannaa purchased apps full quality possible by these apps. I noticed speakers are distorting crazy after 30 percent of volume . At 70 percent they are just headache. Speakers were faulty . Major issue was on left chanel. So i returned this product i decided to replace instead return as jbl name was associated . But it was wrong decision ,here is why... I got replacement as they promised received on time. Amazon service is good even seller understood concern and sent replacement in no time so thumbs up for them.
But it is not about amazon or seller its about speakers .
First thing i noticed was speakers distort after 30 percent of volume . Instruments dont sound crisp . After 50 percent they just start makin noise , vocals overpower amd subwoofer plays in different world only. No co ordination . Very poor eq . Eq setting on remote is just useless. Bass control would have helped. Talkin about only 2 channel speakers sound quality . My f and d worth rupees 2k and Phillips worth rs 3k which has bass control also has wooden cabinet sound much better and clear. Infact they domt make interefering noise like these speakers do make lot of noise at idle and at low volume it is audible and very annoying if you tryin to enjoy music at calm environment . That hiss and buzz sound can make you crazy if you are audiophile. Or who understands music . I suspect poor plastic quality cabinet and poor cables might be issue but lets not go deep into it because it is what it is. Also tweeter grill can make fool to some buyers thinkin it got tweeter too but its cheap designing way to sell product. It doesn't have tweeter . Note this.
If you wish to listen instruments especially piano ,you are goin to be highly disappointed. Even though instruments in songs . It will ruin your music experience . If you understand sound little bit you ll hear plasticy sound and plastic buzz or some noise from cabinet after 50 percent volume with music eq setting on remote. On game eq it sounds better . But highs n lows are reduced a bit overall gives flat sound but atleast you can listen for long. Overall after 15 min of listening at 70 percent volume even 50 and 60 percentage of volume it might givr you headache. I cant take these speakers more than 3 songs .
Talkin about subwoofer. Subwoofer is decemt compared to speakers. Clear bass but it is badly matched wjth 2 channels speakers. Bass knob would have solved it at some extent. If you need to hear thump or want to shake your 10 x 10 room . You ll hv to crank up the volume on music eq . Bass you ll enjoy at this price point but speakers will let you down. Not pleasant experince. I own sony and bose systems as well and i am.no way comparing these speakets to them. But i have cheap f n d n phillips as well. They give more balanced and clear sound though subwoofer is not powerfull as these infinity. So if you are into hip hop edm and trance and electronic music give it a try at this price they are not bad.
Price i purchased was at 4999 and harman website they are 4500 . Seller is selling at high price . If price of the speaker is 4000 rupees they are good speAkers To buy . You ll not hear anythin close to jbl or harman or sony . So if u are someone who wamts to buy just lookim at name jbl and harman look some where else. You be definately disappointed if you have heard jbl before or already have them . I got sony bose jbl akg studio monitors,phillips also cheapest f n d .so i can tell what to expect and what not
. But i wanted spare speakers for YouTube n general listening so i thought lets give a try to this brand name. And i was wrong.
Above all even after replacing new speakers distort as well. And i cant even return item now as it is showing by amazon that product is not delivered to me yet. But it is delivered already and its been 4 days amd still mot updated
. I guess they ll update when return policy perioid will get over. So i cant retutn thrm techincally . Smart. I can give more detailed review but there is no point wasting at this product general listening its ok speakers. If i am able to replace these i would go for Phillips , lg or f n d . At 4 k . I ll get much better sounding speakers. I am not sure i received faulty spakers again. Or they are jus like this. In both case it is not good experience overall. Trying to reach customer care as well but no luck. And on the return link it says you cant return product which is mot delivered to you. But i hv received product lomg time back but they hv not updated that it is delivered so i cant return . I dont know it is techincal issue and deliberately done thing so i cant return. I am.not sure but overall its not right. Still if you dont mind price and wana go with these speakers . And you ll be using it for YouTube and music at about 50 percent max or 40 percent. It is not that bad.
Bluetooth connectivity might give you interference noise. 3.5 cable connection will give clear sound. But less bass. Comparatively. I tried placing my spekars at eveyr possible way also at different locations. Interference noise still exists. So this is one big problem to me . As i mostly work at night. At calm environment you ll hear noise clearly and will start annoying you after a while. Unless you turn up volume to dominate noise but this is not thr solution . Sometimes you need to listen silent music at low volume. Amd you dont wana listen to interference noise which is very annoying. Loudness of speakers is good . But not balanced eq . Vocals are increased so it makes you feel they are loud . But music is about instruments too where you lose all the details and jua hear noise. So buying these speakers is completely subjective . Some people like it jus loud . Some prefer crisp clarity . Some prefer jus bass . Etc. I mentioned what all i faced . And i jus want to return them .",1

"Trust me go for it without any doubt best speaker in 50w
High mid low everything is perfect some people may complaint bass is low but in my opinion it's perfect
I've used many companies speaker like f&d Philips iBall Sony and many more but in this price range I found hardrock 210 is the best
I believe a speaker should be sounds perfect everything is rest no FM no display no bass knob blah blah it dosent matter
Built quality is good
Cons.
Actually I don't found any if you know how to use speaker properly
Only one thing I notice when I play music threw Bluetooth sound quality slightly decreased and when I raise volume it's increase too much",5
"I purchased this top brand speaker for my TV. When I attached this speaker to my TV, I got flat audio, i.e lesser bass and too much high frequency, not pleasant. I never expected this quality with Harman /JBL speakers. I connected with my PC, got excellent balanced sound, connected with my mobile phone through bluetooth, got excellent sound. Again connected with my TV , not satisfied. Hence returned the speaker today.
If you are purchasing this speaker for connecting with a TV, do not buy, as there is no separate volume control for Bass unit and two small speakers. If buying for listening to music through mobile / PC, go ahead and buy.",4
"First of all the listing as well as few customers are saying it‚Äôs from JBL which is incorrect. Infinity itself is a renowned brand and similar to JBL , Harmon acquired it. Secondly, about the speaker I would say that it‚Äôs a very good speaker in this range without any doubt. There is a subwoofer, for mid range, medium speaker in there in the satellite speaker and very interestingly they provided the micro tweeter too to capture the high frequency sound.. now if someone is complaining about the bass then I must say they are not audiophile and are looking for only beats and not the true music ...For true music the system has to reproduce the entire spectrum of sound ... Infact this system has great deep bass reproduction...However, there is only one drawback. The system doesn‚Äôt have the bass and treble knob. So you can‚Äôt adjust them..",5
"It's Not JBL, It's **Infinity Systems** a known brand from USA.
The company was started in 1986 in America and today, they are a part of the Harman International Industries.
Infinity made this Model (Hardrock 210) only for india. You never find this particular Model in Infinity's international website.
This company also make Car Audio Systems and Infinity is primary suppliers for Hyundai, Kia, Mitsubishi, Chrysler.

Now it's time to review the New Home Audio Systems by Infinity (Made for INDIA Only).

I am a professional Sound Engineer.

In my opinion, an essential aspect of good sound is whether it can be projected from the correct angle.

First you make sure that the satellite speakers are angled in the exact position that affords you clear sounds even when it‚Äôs playing at high volumes. no matter where your speakers are installed, you can aim the tweeters in your direction. For Sub, you can try different positions available in your room. Remember Sub is omni directional, you can feel the low frequency all over the place. So install your speakers carefully.

After listening some of my favorite songs, I must say...In this price range the speakers are okay.

Some review says that it's Superb, Excellent, Baap of all etc. It's not true.
But another thing is, How much you pay!!? I bought it for INR.3800/- and In this price I am OK with the sound quality.

Overall performance is ""Okay"" for this price range. Recommend for you.

*********Frequency Response********

Low frequency Tested = 29Hz
High frequency Tested = 18Khz
(As per my ear üëÇ)

********** About Bluetooth *********
This Audio System Only support SBC Audio Codec. (For Bluetooth Only)

Bluetooth Audio sample rate is 44.1kHz / 16 bit.

So you will get CD quality sound through Bluetooth.

NOTE: Today 11 th September 2020.

I fixed the problem.ü§ü",4
"Excellent 2.1 channel speakers üîä
Everything is good for this price point, JBL built quality and thumbing bass
Only con no Fm",5
"I bought these speakers because of name of herman family and because i like bass but this is no way a Bass sound product. Speakers are good for Voice(al low volume) but the bass is bad. At high volume its just irritating. Please dont buy if you are loooking for Bass, and don't get fooled by amazon discount.",2
"Product is hopeless, sound gets reset to highest volume every time you power off and poweron, no matter what you do next time when you poweron you need to used earplugs to avoid damage to your ears. Complaint raised with Harman will update after reply from support team. Worst experience.",1
"Have been using these speakers for a week now, and I must say they are phenomenal. The sound quality is just superb. I was a bit skeptical about buting them after reading
all the negative reviews, about the bass not being good. But, still went with my gut and purchased them considering that they are by Harman Kardon. And boy, I wasn't disappointed. All those saying that the bass is not good and that there is no bottom or knob to control the bass, well let me tell you that the bass and treble are so well tuned that you don't need to adjust anything. Even if you still feel that some adjustment is required, Harman has provided you with 3 preset controls for gaming, music and movies and I feel that does the trick. People complaining, I think you'll just received defective products . All in all a super product and what is even sweeter was the offer price of 3999.00 by Amazon . 5 stars to Amazon for that aswell.",5
"Its just OK but not value for money .
Better buy F&D speakers. Its no way near harman jbl standard . The product i received there is something rattling inside it so i decided to inspect and take a look at amp. It is made of cheap mdf, total 70watt . 15+15(satellite speaker) and 40 watt (subwoofer). Cheap subwoofer is used here .
There is No heatsink on amp IC soo don't play for long in high volume.",3
"Product plastic quality is really good. Look and feel of product is good. We feel that posh look. But coming to sound, the speakers shines in mid and high, but the subwoofer is a failure. Bass is not in league with Creative or Altec Lansing 2.1 which is almost half the money. Bass is muffled. Not keeping the justice to Harman brand label. Bass is really bad, don't know how other reviewers are praising the bass. But mid and high are good & those who loves mid and high tones much more than bass tones, would love this product for sure. Bluetooth pairing is breeze, very easy. Remote control also works fine. There is an annoying blue led ring around subwoofer, but it can be turned off from remote. Not at all suitable for watching movies. Don't get me wrong, bass is there but not anything to excite us. Overall an OKishh product, but not to my expectations and taking consideration of the price of 4500, its an average product in my books.",3
"After a long use i am writing this review of my Infinity Hard Rock. Here are some Pros. and Cons. which i have found on this.
Pros.
1. The combination of bass and trable on this is done very good.
2. Lighting effect is like dj box, which can be off from remote.
3. Bluetooth connectivity is very good on this one.
4. Remote control is much responsive.
5. Although u can't adjust bass trable manually but still there are three inbuilt eq. mode, which will fulfill ur need.
6. Build quality is very good as a deal of Rs. 3800/-
7. As it's SMPS driven so no problem on voltage fluctuation.
8. Satellites have in build twitter. Which sounds very charming.
9. U can control song and volume from remote although it is connected via bluetooth via mobile. Very good feature.
10. Yes it remember last song played from usb even after power failure.
11. U can control song from subwoofer also without remote.
Cons.
1. Whenever u power on the device and play something, it's default volume will be around 65%. U have to manually decrease that. Very bothering.
2. Previously i had Sony srs D9. D9 bass is much more groovy than this one. For punchy bass u have to increase its volume. Very low bass on low volume. But D9 had no problem as there is manual bass control.
3. At very high volume sound distort. But my D9 never disappoint me for distorting sound.
4. There are no any physical display.
5. There are no repeat option from remote.
6. No FM radio at all.
Overall it's a good product considering the price point.",5
"The product is quite good but not that much excellent as compared to other reviews of this product . In terms of look I feel like this is a old design of sound system looks rating I thought 3 out of 5. The remote of the sound system is quite simple there is no so much of features there is only some basic features.
The reason behind purchase this product is the name of the company HARMAN & there is no another reason to purchase this product. I thought HARMAN gives me extreme quality but product doesn‚Äôt make me feel fully satisfied in terms of bass and also I find some small issues like in the remote control there is no button for bass control and also the range of the remote is poor. I need to come very close to subwoofer to operate the same. But yes HARMAN gives a Eco Button behind the subwoofer but I don‚Äôt feel any change in sound quality before or after enable Eco mode . Some other bands gives some more features like bass control, mood change control, treble, tv mode (for news,day to day daily tv shows), 3D mode on and off etc in the same pricing, at this stage HARMAN disappoint me.
But yes you can‚Äôt get the big name like HARMAN in this price range.

But at the end I think for ‚Çπ4000 it is a nice deal not so extreme or bumper, just nice.",4
"Hi Everyone, Being Honest; the speakers are not at all upto the mark.
Problems:
1) On some frequencies the speakers start distorting to a complete next level. Those sound sounds absolutely perfect on my 10 year old iBall speakers.
2) The bass to sound ratio is not at all appropriate, if you want to feel the bass, you'll have to really turn up the volume.

Don't buy them for good bass. The size and shape is like a disguise.",2
Very good product. The only con I feel is that there is no adjustments to increase or decrease the bass.,5
I bought it after watching youtube reviews but literally its bass is really low and bass thumping is also low....it doesn't have bass controll.... When you use it with full volume then only you feel the bass..... Sound quality is awesome except the bass...if you have ever used f and d speakers then you will not like it....,1

 Hello guys, I have been using this product for almost three months now and I am sharing my usage experience for fellow buyers.
1) The build quality of the product is top notch and add to the brand value.
2) The design and appearance of the product is really appealing especially with its pulsating Blue LED ring.
3) Sound quality, JBL signature sound is really superb and justifies the price range.
4) The bass is properly calibrated and suits Music as well as movie.
5) We can't control the bass or treble. But there are dedicated preset button 4 Music game and movie which are really helpful in controlling them.
6) Manual control buttons with colour changing LED for each mode (Bluetooth, Aux, USB) are located at the right side of the woofer.
7) The key for the best output is to place the woofer at the appropriate place in your room. I tried 3 to 4 position before finalising.
8) Bluetooth connectivity is super fast and we can pair multiple devices though only one will be active at a time.
9) The music volume level starts at 50 % while switching on. It can cause trouble if you are switching on at night, especially while playing from USB.
10) It has Eco mode for auto switch off if left under for an hour.
11) There is dedicated button to turn off the pulsating LED you don't need it.
12) Overall value for money product for the sound it delivers, when compared to the competing products.

If you find my review really helpful for knowing more about this product please click YES",5
"Liked the sound quality and built. The sounds of stringed instruments such as guitar and sitar are crystal-clear even on bluetooth connectivity. And also bass is powerful, but sometimes I feel it is bit too high. Could have provided a bass control knob to adjust the bass as per user liking. The blue circular LED light on the subwoofer is cool too.
Few things that I couldn't figure out is how to switch off the LED light and change the equalizer mode without using the remote. On the right-side of the subwoofer, there are 4 buttons: ON/OFF/Connectivity, Play/Pause, +Volume and -Volume. But I could not find which button would change the equalizer mode. I know I can change using the remote, but this is just in case if the remote stops working.",5
"Likes.. Good in terms of looks only. Remote is handy.
Dislikes..
Sound quality and clarity is not as expected. Not upto the mark as mentioned in the specifications. Sound wattage 100W mentioned in the description is exaggerated. I am having a bluetooth speaker with 3W with torch and 4000 Mah battery back up which is having better performance while in high volume too. Sound quality is distorted when in high volume.
Not having slot for memory card which could have been accommodated. No FM. No battery back up.
Pricing is on a higher side. Frontech multimedia speaker which I bought around 16 years back is still working fine. It's sub woofer and speaker is better than this. Not happy at all.",2
"Long Term Review
Imbalanced Sound
Not worth
Only low volume listening is ok
At High Volume family members start requesting to reduce the volume
Overall a useless speaker
Small 10 watt Bluetooth that I use feels lot Better!",1
very poor sound quality.... bass is pathetic. Bass isn't punchy it's just boom-boom. please avoid good reviews and purchase a better one. I wish I could return it.,1
"Its a pretty good speaker. The woofer is perfect. Not for small rooms though.

Pros:

Good sound quality overall.

Bass is too good. By too good I mean, its perfect. Not too much nor missing. Perfect!

Gets pretty loud without distortion. Should be enough for a big hall room as well.

Its remote has quick profile selection. For music, game and movies.
Music profile has more bass and treble
Game profile has less bass and more trebble
Movie profile has muted bass and trebble.

CONS:

Doesn't have a physical bass control.

Poor audio light sync which it comes with. The blue ring light doesn't sync with beats only but also with high trebles. Good thing is that you can turn the lights off on this speaker which is on the remote.",4
"After reading many positive reviews and coming from a famous brand (JBL), I thought that it will not disappoint me. I purchased it on behalf of my sister saying that I will get her a good multimedia system for 100%. Sadly this product proved me wrong. The reasons are-
1. The bass is overwhelming. Even sadder is that the bass can not be controlled. There is no button on the remote as well as the speakers themselves to control the base.
2. If you want to connect it to your smart TV then the only option is via 3.5 mm headphone jack as there is no HDMI port is available here.
3. While watching the TV or anything, you will notice the difference that the speakers of the TV work better than this system because the powerful bass will negate all other instruments and you just stop using it anymore.
I listened to many English and Bollywood songs on it and found that they sound much better with my TV speakers than with these ones. I played Imagine Dragons, Coldplay, One Direction, Linkin Park, songs of Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga, and many more in English along with hundreds of Hindi and Marathi songs on it.
Every time I felt that the bass is ruining almost each and every song that I played.
The lesson learned here is IF YOU ARE A BASS HEAD AND JUST WANT TO LISTEN TO BOOM BOOM AND MUCH LESS ANYTHING ELSE THEN THIS IS A PERFECT SYSTEM FOR YOU. OTHERWISE, JUST STAY AWAY FROM IT FOR YOUR OWN MONEY'S SAKE.
I would suggest you either buy a good soundbar (maybe of MI) and you will be able to listen at least almost all other instruments apart from the bass in the songs and movies or increase the budget and buy some truly home theatre system. Don't waste your money on these speakers. I have stopped using it anymore now and now it is just gathering the dust and nothing else. Wasted my Rs 4499.",1
"Bluetooth: Tiny Lag
Remote control: good (not great) range
Sound: Beautifully balanced, as expected out of Harman
Sound quality: frequencies are not super clearly differentiated, But that's okay considering the number of drivers in the package
bass: enjoyably good, not recommended for bass fanatics for whom sound/music means only low frequencies
accessories: can't complain considering the 2.1 system. Absence of a bulky adapter is really satisfying

Bad: LEDs, like it or not its there always on",4
"High on treble, low on bass. According to the specifications doesn't seems to be a 200 watt variant. Plays descent, nyc ambience lights and connectivity but fails to impress cz hv used sony with same range in the past n that too a bit cheaper than this one, this doesn't stands a chance in front of that, one more issue this product doesn't gets registered on it's official harmon site to activate its warranty. Though all good points for packing quality and return system. Thanks amazon n harmon.",3
"Pros:
1. Nice sound signature and clarity
2. Good bass
3. Loud without distortion
Cons:
1. A few customers would like to tune the bass. But a bass controller is not present.
2. The fancy lighting around the woofer is a distraction. They should have placed the LED which they placed on the side on the front panel.
These are minor issues. But it is a great 2.1.
Recommended.",5
"this item has not separate button to controlled the bass or treble and voice, it has three mode music mode is better than other two mode, other two are game and cinema, both mode almost same. I could not feel that better music experience in low volume, when go to high volume i could feel good music experience. this item suitable for big room and not for small room, any such way you can feel clear audio from the item when aux connection with tv. This system's voice is higher then music so could not feel better music experience. but connect with pc and use multimedia player's equalizer when you can controlled the bass as well as treble and voice and get real music experience. i could not recommended the item to music play on low volume. it suitable for high volume music lover.",3
"A good product, trusted Harmon and JBl brand and purchased this newly launched product. It's not an awesome product but a good product. It won't disappoint with the quality.

Pro's:
Audio quality
Bass is good
I like the blue LED light around the woofer.
Bluetooth 5.0

Con's:
A newly launched product has single RCA input option.
It doesn't have a front display
Even though it had micro tweeter, still I don't hear treble.",4
"Fully satisfied with sound and connectivity. Crystal clear sound. Bass is medium at low sound but as soon as you increase volume, it thumps. No option for Bass and Treble button. It has integrated circuit for optimal sound setting as per song playing. 3 pre-sets sound equilizrs mode given on remote. Physical buttons given on woofer for pause, on off, volume and next back. Blue round LED on woofer adds attractive harmony effect on music moves.

It serves my purpose by having Bluetooth and RCA connection. Remote is fully operational but Harman needs to work to improve plastic quality. Also it should have facility for wall mount.

It does not have FM, but obviously it's not my need. Got at RS. 3799 in offer.
Just go for it.",5
"Bit disappointed with the sound quality. Good for high bass loud music but not so good for regular slow music.
Price is much higher than similar products.",2
"I was expecting a good Bass and really loved it, initially my budget was ‚Çπ2000 and I love Bass so I started looking for comparisons and I ended up ‚Çπ4500 F&D but I compared it with Infinity Hard rock and I decided to go with Infinity as it is good with Bass, and as I expected I got a good speaker to enjoy music. And I was really worried before about the reviews that the treble is not good etc but for me as a Bass lover I don't see any much of a problem, if you are normal person who likes Bass then it's for you, but if you are a DJ or a pro then it is not for you
If you're budget is less than 5500 then it is for you
The more the budget the better the sound.

3 modes:
1. Game mode - less Bass
2. Video Mode - Smooth Bass
3. Music Mode - More Bass
No more control other than that
Sound Volume is massive no problem
I loved it",5
"The system is nice and fine in terms of sound production. However I found few cons as below:
(Photos attached)
1. Less number of sound adjustments provided
2. When you change to bluetooth/aux there‚Äôs no indication for the same.
3. The sound modes (Music, Movie, Game) doesn‚Äôt make any significant difference in terms of music/sound production
4. Remote response quite slow and you need to point it exactly towards the system to use it.
5. No hanging points given at back of the satellite speakers in case you want to hang them. You‚Äôll have to use a stand only if you want to position it on a higher position.",3
"The speakers are really really good when it comes to the sound quality. Well that's what you would expect from a brand like this anyways. I'm really happy with the sound in that regard. However, the lack of bass control and treble control ruins almost everything. There's this gaming and movie mode which works to an extent (movie mode reduces the bass a bt and increases the treble) but dialog clarity is something I cannot compromise with, while watching a movie.
These are one of the best when it comes to music and games...For movies, not so much.",4
"I got this in a lighting deal for rs.3600 and first I was disappointed with the sound initially because there was no enough bass but as days I realized that I was wrong, it's not like other who give a lot of bass but the vocals are dull but this one has crisp sound and bass was good at higher volumes. Loudness is too good.",5
"This is an excellent set. Buy without any doubt. I have a hall of around 5m X5m and the speakers rock it!!

Good bass levels. Very clean deeb bass. I have attached the speakers to my TV via a 3mm stereo pin. The speech and the bass are very nice managed by the system.

Blue tooth range is good. Connection can be managed from the remote ( bluetooth, aux and USB)

No vibrations, no jarring at higher volume.

It has 3 equalisers - music, game and movie. The music mode pumps up the bass and treble ranges and gives full range of sound.

I have heard a few 2.1 sets like iball, creative but this one stands out. If you are looking for a 2.1 set go ahead and buy this one.. you will not regret.",5
"This is awesome.. The sound quality is very good. Its clear and and loud as well. It can shake your room and the neighbors will go crazy.
The bluetooth connectivity is very fast and connects within seconds. But the volume adjustment, when on bluetooth is little bit strange with some devices(Mobile phones). It will be very loud and when you reduce the volume it will become very low but with some adjustments it will be fine.
Work pretty well with aux cable.
The Blue LED looks very nice with all the lights out and room is dark.
Remot control is samll and cute, but working is nice.
Only con is that there are no knob or button, to control bass and eco, on the speakers. You will have to adjust it in your devices. Go to equalizer setting and fix it. And you will have perfect sound. Actually i dont like too much bass so i felt the issue. For many it wont even matter.
Over all the producy is great. Value for money. I simply loved it.",4
"This is so good! More than I expected. Using this with my PC. Great audio clarity and it can deliver an actual Theatre experience for a room of 150 to 200 sq.ft. Keep the Sub-Woofer on the floor for best results. Bluetooth connectivity is fast and has a good range. Sound with BT is superb too.

It would have been perfect
1. If the bass adjustment switch were provided separately. As of now, when you reduce the volume, it's bass levels drops too.
2. If the remote range and connectivity is improved. As of now, it is poor, and it defeats the purpose of having a 'remote control'.

But overall, For this cost, it's awesome value and a must have product (for a room size of 150-200 sq.ft.)",5
"I bought this product in Nov, 2019 having been lured by the brand name Infinity from the JBL / Harman Kardon stable. What I found was a poor sounding product (likely made in China) that has little to offer except a cheap price. It capitalises on the brand name which is misleading in this case as it's nothing but a cheap, made for India product. I'm very finicky about sound quality and it was certainly foolishness on my part to expect good sound quality at this price. I'm mostly interested in music and the sound quality highly disappointed me. Moreover, the speaker grills on the satellites seem misleading as from outward appearance it appears they contain two drivers each, but most probably each satellite contains only one full range driver, likely a three incher. Returned the product fast. Will be more careful buying in future, and will scrutinize this company's product more closely.",3
"Expected a lot but this product disappointed me by the sound quality, Sub Woofer was not near anywhere with what I expected. I connected with MacBook Pro but the music coming out from this product was very average, u will not feel quality. Then I thought may be the problem was with my room, so I took it and connected in another room, hall, with TV.....tried a lot to give this product a life with me....hi hi.....but still not getting what my old creative inspire gave to me which is coming under this products price range but 4 or 5 year's ago.
So I returned this product, and purchased JBL Studio Monitor Nano K4-4"".
Amazon did a decent job by giving back a fast refund.
Thank you Amazon ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"Cannot register the product on Harman website.
Moreover, screws on the front outer silver rim were not properly fixed.
Wasn't expecting this from such a well-known brand.

Edit:
1. Fixed the screw lol
2. Still cant register
3. About the excessive bass (this is if only you feel it so) try using a small software known as Equalizer APO 1.2.1 (my current version) and use the Config editor to tune the sound to your likened choice. Enjoy the blast!
4. About bluetooth connectivity issue, yes it has a very short range but for me since it being a fixed unit around my desktop, I dont mind it much. Besides I just have to play music from my desktop Spotify üòÇ
5. Finally, it definitely is a good choice but I am not if it is the best though.",4
"This review is for people who are particular about their Audio experience. If BASS and LOUDNESS is all you want, then you can buy this.

Product Review: (After using 2 Units)
The Good stuff-
1. Loudness with minimal to no Distortion till 50% Volume
2. Bass (Deep) Love it (if only it was on other proper functional 2.1 stereos)
3. Remote

The Bad Stuff-
1. Bluetooth (Worst ever in a 2.1 stereo) No range, it couldn't do a 5 feet connection without dropping, tested with 5 devices.
2. Bluetooth quality when you play the track is not great but Okay, we aren't buying 2.1 for okay quality (High Hissing starts with tracks and stops when you pause or stop the track)
3. USB is Okay, better than Bluetooth on this unit (High Hiss noise, lesser than Bluetooth)
4. Aux is the closest to Decent thing on this unit. (Low Hiss noise till 60% volume, high hiss noise after 60% volume) Hiss noise is constant from the second you switch to Aux, even when nothing is playing. YOU WILL HEAR IT IN THE NIGHT CONSTANTLY, MARK IT. I am going back to my F&D 550X.
5. The plastic casing for speakers isn't enough for the speakers power. The second the casing loses it's glue, you will notice rattle on highs and lows and wherever possible. (1st unit defective casing experience)
6. Speaker wires may not be shielded enough, which is why the Hissing noise is always there. (My F&D 550x is silent as a sleeping baby)
7. I repeat, the HISSING NOISE IS REAL. If you know your Audio stuff, then this unit isn't the one you want.
8. Could've thrown in a LCD.

Could've been the best in Range, if the manufacturers didn't cheap out on the little stuff like speaker wires and better internal components to minimize the noise.

Personally Given a choice, I would go with F&D (in this price range) for the absolute silence when not in use and no Hiss when in use on any mode. If all you care about is Bass, then you can buy this.

PACKAGE REVIEW: This is for the seller or the packaging team or whoever that PACKED THE BOX IN THE PICTURES and delivered it to me.

THE WORST STUFF-
My Original order was New, sealed and in perfect box. I wanted a replacement for the Hissing noise that I mentioned above.

I received the hand to hand replacement on 28th, 9:10 pm. Opened it and I lost my cool (CHECK PICTURES)
It felt like i gave the delivery guy a NEW UNIT and took a replacement which was OLD, PREVIOUSLY RETURNED and ABSOLUTELY DAMAGED AND PATCHED BOX WITH TAPE. By the way, the patched box unit has right channel AUX issue (won't play on the right).

The AUDACITY of the Seller OR the Packaging team to actually tape the box together and ship it out to customer is REMARKABLE (check pictures)

I wanted another replacement because obviously you'll know from the pictures and cause of AUX issue, replacement was denied and refund was offered and WAS ASKED TO ORDER AGAIN FOR HIGHER PRICE (current price) I got it on Indian Festival deal for much less than the current price.

So, after all the headache and time waste, can't wait for the Pick up to get rid of this Unit.

3 Stars to the Unit
-10 Stars to the Package and Dispatch team (Amazon)
0 Stars to Amazon CS (who dealt with this order)

Amazon INDIA CS sucks when it shouldn't.",3
"Overall nice package. Here are some nice things about these speakers:-

Good sound quality i didn't expected this from Plastic cabinet speakers and Bass is totally amazing and subwoofer cabinet is wooden means it will deliver puchy bass. i am using these speakers for TV in a 20*20sq feet room.

2) It has bluetooth 5.0 (as Harman is advertising) so it delivers very good sound quality via Bluetooth which is far much better then the other competitors like F&D etc in this price range or little higher .

Cons:-
Manual knob for Bass, and tribble should be provided behind the subwoofer with are unfortunately absent.

There is no other cons that should i mention here.
Anyways, Speakers are good 5star from me.",5
"Verified Purchase
I bought product when there was not any review available for this product. I ordered it thinking JBL will not disappoint me and i was true.

But i didn't want to compromise in audio quality.
This delivers what i needed, i. e. Correct frequency response. Some people complaining about low bass, let me mention it gives sound signature of JBL audio .it gives pure bass pleasant to ears not unnecessary booming like roadside dhoom dhadaka..i hope you understand what i am trying to say..i returned blaupunkt as the bass was extra boomy that ruins the melody of music..some people likes it but i don't. I prefer balanced sound signature. This delivers perfect bass response and the punch comes when it is needed..it is a mark of great sound signature..i can assure that after listening this even audiophiles will not complain. Maybe people who complaining about bass must replace their product, i am sure they got defective item.
It doesn't have bass and treble control feature but why someone need to disturb the sound signature by tweaking it. I don't feel any need, though it can be done with phone equalizer.
One addition - it has 3 equalizer preset modes present on remote. That works perfectly. game, music and cinema

Loudness is more than enough, i haven't played it at full volume as my windows started vibrating so i lowered it down. No one wants complains from neighbours.

Coming to build quality. It is perfect nothing to complain in this section.

It is the best one could get in this price range.
Usually i don't write reviews but i struggled a lot while ordering this unit as there was not a single review available for this, i hope this will help others a little bit.

Finally not but not least my neighbors and house owners no one has not ordered (scold) to decrease the volume and sound.

Thank you infinity (JBL) given very good music system to me and it's scientist who invented (prepared) this product. Thank you one and all.",5
"It is a very good set of 2.1 speakers. You won‚Äôt be disappointed at all with the sound and bass at this price. Just one issue on which the company can work on is manual bass controller as I am a huge bass fan and sometimes I want to hear the bass more than the lyrics so yeah but overall it‚Äôs the best product in the market right now.
The 3 modes it has for gaming, music and movie, they really change the experience of audio. Movie mode will let you listen to the vocals clearly and music mode will add extra bass. I have been using this for 3-4 months and never faced any issues till now.",5
"But i had return it because i had purchase Creative too,
I had to choose one in between, I wanted to retain INFINITY that, but other people said me to return and retain Creative, But Truly i say both was good but INFINITY was little bit better that creative, in that particular 2.1 speakers. in that 4000/- around range. it is very difficult to find what was better in both but experts, and sound lover can observe the true quality of speakers. I would say INFINITY is good, in that range 2.1 speakers around 4000/- range.",4
"Almost completed 2 months, it's really a very good speaker considering the price from Harman family.
Connected with my TV
‚Ä¢ The Sound Quality is very good
‚Ä¢ Bass is also good, not overpowering.
‚Ä¢ Watching movies is fun with crystal clear sound.
‚Ä¢ Listening to music is also great.
‚Ä¢ Volume is also great.

Though different people has different taste in music and sound, it can vary.",5
"I connected for my computer first I don't know about announcement while connecting Bluetooth sudden announcement I shocked then tried to reduce volume but no change s ,I am using Sony bar speaker simply it will connect no announcement, bass is avg and treble is good ,my 2000/- speaker gives more crispy bass,no control for treble and bass other wise no word for quality good product,must provide bass control and treble, other wise no meaning for buying this product,",5
"Being a sub product of JBL, obvio the sound quality is damn good , bt the only downfall is that thr is no option to adjust the bass . . the bass i flt is a bit too much for the sound . so before u buy keep it in mind that u will have to live with the default bass of the product , u wont be able to manually tune it according to ur wish, even of u try with the sound equaliser on ur Windows , u wont be able to do it .",3
"On my experience it's good stream in Bluetooth
Bluetooth connectivity is really superb
Sound quality is also really impressive.
Bass level is really very punchy without any distrotion.
Speakers give you very clear sound.
Default is no bass control even though it's not available I am much impressed.
No distrotion at full volumes everything is crystal clear..üëåüëåüëå",5
"I am writing this review because there are so many misleading review about the poor performance. I have a variety of speakers in past 2.1, acoustic, monochannel ,stero channel party boxes and all. So its pretty much i have observed all the segments of sound quality from intex to bose. This speaker is not a bose level but its far better than fenda, creative and other regular over the counter brands in market .. this speaker reminds me of my old altec Lansing 2.1 which now is discontinued. Now coming straight to bullet points.
Pros:
‚ñ™Ô∏é25 watts of bass is best in comparison to 6.5 inch woofer category it doesn't distort if you are using 320kbps tracks on a good quality device.
‚ñ™Ô∏é12.5 watts √ó2 midrange aks satellite speakers are clear as crystal.
If you listen to EDMS, HIPHOP and JaZz this is the best speaker in this price range .
Cons:
‚ñ™Ô∏éRemote is very basic no feature to adjust bass or treble from it.
‚ñ™Ô∏éonly blue led light is present which is in sync with the audio frequency of song.

This speaker is not at all bad it leave an impression of a niche brand at your crib. Also it have a very good bass to treble ratio only people who have had an experience with highend devices will appriricate that. Its not having the overpass bass that you listen in local weddings .. its having the sound which is perfect for enjoying music and movie mode is balance too for giving you a deep sound with clear dialogs.",5
"This setup is not bad at all, initially when i bought it, it sounded pathetic with bluetooth of my phone, however after a few brainstorming, i figured out a setting in the phone which led to poor sound quality, hence I am writing this review to make everyone aware of it...
I own a oneplus 7 pro,. So all those one plus owners, make sure you enable ' disable absolute volume' in developer options. In short, your absolute volume for bluetooth connectivity should be off. After this, the speakers sounded like as if somebody gave it a testosterone shot. Simply superb.
For all those who own a different phone than one plus, they also need to disable absolute volume and am sure you will love the sound.
The only downside, it doesnt have bass and treble adjustment, but now i hardly need them.",4
"Well where do I start..Lets see, the Delivery was super fast to where I stay got it within 3 Days..Amazing Good Job AMAZON..Coming to the Price I feel I got it at a Steal Deal..was looking around for a 2.1 speaker with good sound and price and stumbled upon this..Initially I had read the reviews and was skeptical on buying one but then I decided to just go for it and boy I was thrilled and amazed...In the description of the product 100W powerful speaker was mentioned and I'm sorry to disappoint you all that they are lies, the 100W power is peak power but in actual these speakers are 50W (RMS).
Audio Quality is crystal clear best speaker for Rock / Metal Music, Bass is not too thumping which is good for me personally and the connection to My TV / Laptop / PC and even Bluetooth is smooth and easy..the remote is tiny and does the job well..I like the Blue light where you can switch it on and off.. Build quality is good almost comparable to the Sony..Overall I'm a Happy Customer :)

I loved the Speaker's sound quality so much that I went online again and bought another one for my workroom.",5
"First of all. I trusted the seller appario retail while choosing the product. What I received is a defective used item.
1. Subwoofer has some loose metal screws spinning around inside the cabinet
2. Missing remote
3. The amazon packing is damaged and sliced through the packing tape. Not sure they stole the remote
4. Replacement initiated 5 days ago still did not receive any replacement which is very bad

Good things
Sound quality was decent sadly I didn't have remote to check its features
Build quality is typical and rock solid
Delivery of damaged product is on time sadly replacement is taking more than 5 days it makes me to think of appario retail as a irresponsible seller",1
"I initially had doubt about quality, but since Herman its distribution I took a chance, petchased for 4700 ‚Çπ , product is really good and I audio output is really good and clear, bass is good at this prize, Bluetooth connectivity is really nice üëç , remote is looking good but have to press buttons multiple times some times and range for ir remote is less I feel",5
"The product is good. It has good bass. But quality of sound is not that great. (Lower priced creative units have much clear sound ).
Was expecting somthing from Inifinity to be higher quality, as I have both jbl and inifinity amps and speakers in my cars.
Over all good prodcut if you need something loud for parties or just setting sound for watching games on tv. But if good sound quality is what you need, look for somthing from creative or logitech .",4
"The build quality of the speaker is awsome....but the bass is not heavy as expected. At this price range it could have bass control button and a digital display. As we strt changing the tracks we r actually blind to knw which track is going to play next n which folder is currently playing. But the thing is that, its Harman, so its a pride to have, n its build quality n durability will be high enough for their reputation.... Its gives awsome n non disturbing great bass...the sound quality is well tuned. Build like a rock....üëçüí™... No bad feeling like while we use chinese cheap products. There is a problem vt the remote connectivity as the remote sensor is given on the side not at front. Its best to watch movies as it gives u theatre like experience. There could hv been a knob for bass and treble control at this price to make this product not beatable....",4
"This points is for Amazon only: I will not purchase any electronic item from Amazon now onward, this my last. And cheating on price is ridiculous from Amazon, I purchased it for 4999 and from next day it was available for 3599, bot Acceptable.

Good Sound quality not great for this price.
Connectivity is ok.
When power off and next time power on the sound resets to maximum, it basically does not remembers the previous setting.
Remot is pathetic, its like a toy, ridiculous for this price band. No bass controls.",4
"Putting my feedback after ~ 2 weeks of usage.
I wanted a compact home theater for my bed room and after long and detailed comparison I found this speaker worth buying because of sound quality. I still had doubt in my mind because of many review from other that base output is very low. Something which I was not happy about is "" this is made is China product"".

I really don't think there is any issue with base. It's decent as expected from 2.1. but yes if you compare this with Dolby home theater then yes you will see some difference. Sound is loud and I don't think I even cross 50% of sound output. Also I don't think switch for base adjustment is needed. Also if someone want to buy 4.1 or 5.1 then go for base barrel home theater. Those are less costly and come with very good sound output quality. It's a made in India brand too.",4
"Hello guys...I already use infinity sub woofer encloser in my car so i already have faith with this company.
I ordered this 210 home theatre in offer so i got it in 4500.
When I see youtube videos and pictures of this home theatre then I believed that size is good but today i get and when i open this order i saw that woofer and coloum size is very small that time i disappointed but when i instaled and play a song threw Bluetooth in my mobile its sound amazin bass is really very very loud its is similar like chote pack mai bada dhamaka.
I have airtel xstream box so it is easily connect with Bluetooth of airtel setup box so no need of wire connection with tv.
Second thing is i instaled hole setup near my sofa so i can clearly listen every sound and voice crystal clear.
2 speakes are good one is for left back side second is with back right side .more then 2 setelite speakers eans more taro ka janjaal.
Only one thing is disapping that remote is little thin like we used in car players but rest it is best in this segment.
Go with this this will never disappoint you .",5
"After uesing one week ,1) I realised that it need to provide separate knobs to control bass.
2) volumes is good you not need to rich hight .but it not memories last volume level Avery time you start volume gose to 50% that is very loud.
3 ) packaging and delivery is good no problem with products quality.
4) it cost 4500 this is average or hight don't pay extra wait for offer ,I an waiting for 3 month.
5)it not JBL products it come under Herman family.
6)if you staying in rent house dot buy or don't play it 100% volume , then your room owner throw you and speaker , out of the house.
Now I'm homeless and sleep in road with my speaker.",5
"They are really good for the money, and the light doesn't look that cheap, the overall plastic and wood is also not that bad,
It lacks a basically most of the important controls, no bass, treble control on the speaker.

Looks fairly decent to me..",4
This product gives you thumping bass and superior sound quality. It's best if your are using this with mobile laptop and desktop where you can manually control the Bass. Not good for TV due to lack of controlling bass its impossible to understand dialogues,4
"After using 7 months I am writing this review. infinty speakers supported by JBL is a good product but not expecting pure JBL sound clarity for this. 2.1 speakers sound well and good bass for small living rooms also.

Cons: After seven months one speaker stop working and technician visited my house and took that speaker for replacement. Now Infinty don't have this model for replacement and they are not willing to repair the item also. Worst service experience.",2
"First of all thank you Amazon as ordered product delivered on time and without getting damage.
Second Infinity JBL will give you quality of sound even if you raise volume it wont give you ""burru burru' sound. Good speakers and big bass subwoofer in this price range. Worth to buy. Some reviews told subwoofer making too much sound but its not true it is their equaliser settings are not good.",5
"Perfectly balanced between sound and bass. Many of the speakers will have more bass with less sound or more sound with less bass. But this one is perfectly tuned.
Pros.
1. Easy connectivity
2. Clear sound
3. Well balanced for bass and sound
4. 3 different equilliser
5. Loudspeakers
6. Led light apperance looks good.
7. Built quality is also good

Cons
1. No FM radio
2. Cheap remote
3. No seperate control for bass
4. Volume buttons are placed in subwoofer, in a side.
5. Interface is not so good
6. It's not 100w it's actually 50w RMS.

Note: For better experience of bass always keep your subwoofer on floor. Do not keep on computer table or TV table, desk or side to TV.",4
"For the price of 3800 this speakers are for sure bang for bucks. CLEAR sound at 70-80% volume, which is loud enough. I felt a bit distortion at 100% volume but will bypass this given the price range.
BASS is really loud and thumpy.
Build quality is also good given the price range.
I am using it mainly with bluetooth, not sure about usb device or AV input. That blue light definitely is a winner for the speaker's look.",4
"Try testing this product with some Epic them music, You will know its worth.
I have tested and it really works fine.
Though it does not have one bass Knob, I never felt I needed that. This is mainly because whatever bass is locked in audio it presents it perfectly.
So we can hear sounds what Music producers wanted us to hear,! without us manipulating the bass.

Thank you",5
"This speaker 2.1 channel is great especially It can go too loud without any distortion, crisp and clear sound ...instrumentals play, vocals and rich music experience definitely goona imapct good note....Bass is great only if you place the bass unit at corner in your room.
2 stars down because it was a worst delivery experience as main speaker unit has several dent marks as it was not packed appropriately.",3
"ATTENTION:- It‚Äôs my personal opinion
That it could have been better if it had blinking light or led display on front . & price is little bit on the higher side although I bought it in lightning deal @3999.00 but according to other brands available in mkt features little less, which I feel.
Otherwise aaawsom product. Base is thumping & balanced",3
It‚Äôs a very good option if you want it for your laptop or for bedroom. You can use it for party at home. Clear sound. Thumping bass . And actually signature sound. LED looks beautiful. I am happy with the purchase . There were few minor scratches as sims to be a display wala speaker or might happened during handeling. I would definitely recommend this.,5
This speaker not good quality volume this speaker is very dumb quality so no by this speaker to all customers,1
Very poor sound quality. Even local speakers produce much better sound. Don't go by brand name. Has been using Philip's 2.1 home theatre since last 4 years which is much better. Thinking of returning and ordering Philip's system,1
"If your need is just amplification of sound without considering balancing, great bass etc., then the product is good for you but then, you can get the same results in less than half the price.

There are better products in the same price range or lower. I am disappointed.",3
"Just go for it.....
Sound quality awesome...
I had bose bluetooth speaker worth rs 24900/- but this infinity hardrock beat it .
U will feel great sound experience....

Bass is clear even if u turn on full volume...
50% volume is more than enough to vibrate ur wall windows...

It's a great purchase....just go for it without any doubt in mind......

It is unbelievable product at such price...
I would not surprised if infinity raise its price in future...

Just go for it....",4
"I am completely satisfied. Sound quality is great, balanced. Pairs easily and just works. I connect my TV to it and enjoy YouTube music in this in great quality. I am not an audiophile and do not care about the manual bass control etc., for me this works fine off the box and doesn't complicate things.",5
I have bought more then 50 products from Amazon but nothing dissatisfied like this one worst product ever no bass control bass is working automatically here and there some times higher some times lower and sound quality i didn't expected this much of worst sound quality very bad product don't ever think to buy this,1
"Bought it at 4500.
One of the best quality speakers I have bought till now.
Best sound quality.
Everything is above expectations.
First thought that i have spent more for 2.1 later once i used it I was very satisfied.
Go for this if you find the product around 3500-4000.",5
Even Frontech intex like useless speaker manufacturers produce better items. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL! I have a JBL Partybox 100 so its not like i dont understand sound quality or cannot afford good speakers and expecting unnecesarily from cheap products. Sound is not at all 100w. Bass is JUST ABSENT,1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 product is good quality is nice but the issue with the bass box the quality which was expected by me doesn't meet. Bass box has issue of extra air paas from panel of channel jacks so that's why the bass sound is not giving the best bass but it's fine Accordding to the price this is one of the best sound speaker's...",4
"I hooked it to my work station. A very good set of speakers. Sound quality, bass is amazing. I even tried it on my LG tv which has Dolby virtual X. Sounded great but slightly the dialogues were not clear because of the bass.

Remote is pathetic. You cannot control it from more than 2 ft. Also, there is no Bass control. When connected to Laptop the interface is not user friendly.
If you want a set of good quality speakers that are inexpensive, sound good, and look decent, go for it.",4
Very good sound quality base and depth is perfect for the price. For 5000 this is the only perfect. Connectivity very quick and easy to deduct. Only thing is miss is base control. It is fixed. Still all stars from my side.,5
Remote control distance very near only 1 or 2 mtrs working after no remoteness. When we listen songs compare with Sound Bar systems voice Quality this clarity not good and output sound wattage not coming 100 watts as per website description. Through remote we can adjust bass üîä control very low. system settings bass and treble given through remote 3 types only and also ther is no difference 3 modes.,3
"Bought it, for the high frequency sound the frame vibrating and creating a sound which make this speaker looks like a cheap one. thought it was an issue since only one of the speaker was causing returned it got another one same issue. Now I am stuck with it. I have Sony 80w which is much more better than this. Now I am stuck with this.",3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Superb product at 4000/- -4300/- price range. I got it in lightening deals. At 5K , this seems expensive and you can compare with Sony (6.5K)

Purchase it if you want to enjoy the music. Deep bass gives soothing effect. Room filled sound with clarity.
Better than F&O,Philips and other similar range products.

This is surely a product for music lovers. Even at high volume the Bass is not distorted.

Pros :
1. Sound quality and Deep bass
2. No distortion at high volume
3. Cool blue light gives soothing effect

Cons
1. FM not available
2. SD card slot not available
3. No display

Don't purchase if you want DJ / Band floor shaking bass wherein the Bass is extremely high but distorted.",5
This product is totally amazing . One thing to note is that I received a product with its seal broken and also the sub woffer was not screwed in the screws were loose so I had to screw it in . Besides 5hat the sound quality is amazing and the bass is awesome you will have to adjust the eq on your phone a little bit to enhance the bass .,4
"Here are the points for pros and cons that will help u to buy it
Pros.
1. Value for money
2. Deep and clear bass
3. No distortion on the max volume at all.
4 buit quality feels premium

Cons.
1. Power cable could be longer
2. You can not control bass. There are 3 modes u can switch among gaming movie and music. These are not bad vlbut seprate control could be btter.

Thats it. There are really damn good speakers.",5
The product doesn't produce good bass. Also it distorts at high volume. And in high volume it's not good to hear. No option to increase the bass. 2000 rs speaker sounds better than this,2
"Clarity of music is very important. You will hear each beat with this system.

Bass is very balanced.

Bluetooth works fine even from more than 10m distance.

Remote is added advantage and work well in point to point range.

Recommend this to all who are looking for good system in this price segment.",5
"The poorly built speaker. Zero weight, poor sound quality, worst sound profile. Zero vocal clarity, instrumental separation is very poor. Highs and lows are crappy. Mids are okayish. Not loud at all. Only 20% of the volume can be kept. Plasticky. Bluetooth connectivity range is poor. Not worth the price. Basically like a 1000 rs speaker rebranded as JBL infinity",1
"These speakers are wonderful. The sound is great, there is no distortion in sound. The remote is too small and easy to lose. The bluetooth connectivity is good. Looks good. The light can be turned off with the remote.
A good recommendation at this price of Rs 4500.",5
"Firstly,
I would rate a 3 star for delivery, as the woofer is damaged a bit. Not sure if it is as part of the delivery or from the seller. But I would take it as sound quality is more priority(Dent is a small one).

Quality: 4 Star
As I read in some review, the bass is getting distorted at full volume. It's true. It would have been great if there is a BASS control.

Bluetooth connectivity is good and crystal clear.
AUX music quality is not as expected.
Remote is not a good quality one.
USB works well and tested with 320kpbs and the quality of the sound is good

All I can say is, worth the money.",3
"Awesome bass.
After several months of use

1. Sound quality is excellent when compared with the price.
2. Only thing which makes me feel wrong about this product is, there is not manal or knob control on the device, except the remote control. So someone cannot even increase the volume incase the remote is damaged or lost..",5
After searching offline... Experiencing sony FnD Philips etc etc.. none made me comfortable. As always amused by the quality of sound from JBL ..this time i again gambled with Harmon and it did not disappointed me. Just perfect bass ..neither too boomy nor too low..just a perfection which will sooth your ears. Loved it,5
"Pros
1. Built Quality upto the mark
2. Loud sound is good for funtions
3. Wire length is adequate
4. Heavy deep bass at high music

Cons.
1. No heavy deep bass
2 Deep bass only audible when at loud sound
3. Fake promise on Amazon that's 100 watts output.
4 No radio
Final verdict
But only if you want to play it loud
And if your handset has custom equaliser",2
"Nice product i like the lights effect in woofer with music and sound is really clear but bass is not that good , there should a bass controller in the woofer , bass is less overall good product",4
"Infinity is from Harman, That was the first thing that came to my mind when i was purchasing this one.And yes Harman has shown justice to this beautiful speaker with high performance.I have been using this for two weeks and these are the best.
Pro's
1) Brilliant sound quality
2) Intelligent design.Loved the way it is designed.Creates a vibe every time i switch on this device.
3) Pure bass
4) Bluetooth connectivity is strong
5) Different modes for Movie and Music
6) Value for money
7) ECO mode
Con's
1) Bass cannot be controlled
2) Remote control disappoints at times.
It is the best in this price range.Value for money guaranteed ! GO FOR IT",5
"Bhai sudhh hindi me batau to ye sirf bass lover ke liye he.
Mene kafi sare YouTube me video dekhe.
Fir mene ise mangaya.
Or mene f&d ke 2.1 bhi suna he lekin ye unse bahut hi powerful he.
.
Ye normal music ke liye nahi he only bass lover ke liye he ise aap room me jyada time tak nahi sun payenge.
Kyoki isme bass controller nahi he jiske karan aap ko har gane me bass milega.
Ye chhoti moti party ke liye bahut hi badiya he.
Bas ek hi kami he bass controller nahi he, lekin koi baat nahi fir bhi aapko iski sound quality bahut hi high lagegi.
.
Bhai mujhe to maza hi a gaya.",5
"I am happy with the product, it has a premium look and BASS, Sound clarity is awesome!!! It's superb and you will get a theater feel if you are playing music in a closed room.

I recommend this product if you are searching something around 4K to 5K!",5
it was very easy to connect them with my computer with Bluetooth. remote is easy to operate. sound is good enough for a large room but not for whole house. only drawbacks are: it does not have bass control. it does not have any display so you can not see whether sound is getting increased or decreased. apart from it other things are good. if you are alone in room and watching movie or playing a game than this is perfect for you.,4
"Worth the money.
Great Bass lives up to JBL name.
Good loudness and great thump best feature is the light off button of Woofer.
Nice sound isolation and less to no distortion a good SNR.
Only drawback is the length of the wires is short would be best if wires were lengthy.",5
"This is the best 2.1 speaker i was looking to use for entertainment, PC, Online class etc. Excellent sound quality, i saw people saying this model doesn't have bass control and that's true, but you still can change bass low/medium/high using three sound preset mode which are Game, Music & Movie.",5
Everything is fine. Awesome build quality. But this system has some drawbacks. They are : [1] There should be a small display to indicate volume. [2] There should be manual controls on subwoofer to increase/decrease bass & treble.,4
The speaker is good the sound quality is optimised for all audio types .Considering the cost the speaker is a good deal at 3500 bucks but if you want deep bass with very rich quality then you would be better off without this .,3
"Sound quality is pretty good, but not at all satisfied with sound output , output should have been more, not even sufficient in a room hall to hear movie audio should have been more louder for the price charged.",3
"Mainly i'm a bass lover.... & this one fulfilled my wish properly ‚ù§. Bass is super Awsome on this price segment. Vocals are also crystal clear. So pleasant to hear It....
There is no big cons... Only they should the controller for bass mainly because it enhance the bass more ... So sometime u have to decrease the volume to low down the bass... That's not a big issue..
& The remote sometimes don't work properly.
Overall in this price seg & Brand value of JBL the best one‚úå",4
"Sound quality and Bass effect is very nice but remote control quality is very poor and there is no LCD display to know what we are playing, manufacturer should pay attention that operating buttons must be top of the the woofer are in front side",4
"I bought it in a deal, gifted to a friend
Its a sound monster, good connectivity, works great in 3 BHK floor.
Bass and other equalizers are great, best in sound quality
Just loved it",5
"First very bad service you sent home theater is not connect TV. So you replace item but again didn't connect TV, bluetooth connectivity is very bad, aux is connecting sound troubling up & down automatically. No FM, no HDMI port, no extra usb port. Other product compair than high price lowest facialty. I hope that replace item is satisfy me but nothing. Amazon delivery is very fast but dealer service sad. Why showing JBL company name in product ? Infinty company blame JBL Service and name. Can't purchase this product.",1
I bought this coz reviews were good. There is no bass adjustment button. No display to know source of music selected or volume. Little complicated like.. But Sound quality specially bass if you need then better to opt for fenda f380x. Its truly value for money... infinity is just Ok for the price you get it..,3
I just get this product. On and check it. Bass is not good. Volume is low. My iBall 2.1 is better than this. Not satisfied with this product. Waste of money. I am not happy with infinity and from company expectations. :( ‚òπÔ∏è 2000‚Çπ speaker better than this. Distorting sound quality.,1
"Everything is ok , i like my choice , they meet my expectations, sound quality, bluetooth connectivity and remote control is good , but one think is that i recieved my product in damaged conditions, main unit's speaker not attached with wood cabinet and shaking inside , all 4 screws put out from wood , some damaged from outside on corners, i was disappointed for minutes, but i decided to didn't wasting time to returning it , i was open it and fix , i think it was because of bad carring during courier service, after all i am happy with infinity hardrock 210 .",5
"I got sound system with loose speaker then immediately I reported to Amazon customer care, they placed order for replacement and after few days I received new piece.

This review is after using the product for a month. JBL infinity Hard Rock is excellent product, clear sound quality. Bass is excellent when we play loud music. Even when we play music in low volume it is a treat to ear.

Remote looks cheap, though it works well but should have been little bigger completing the brand JBL.",5
"Let's start with cons first:
1. Seller is not reliable as he first send me used stuff and latter upon complaining send the new one.
2. No equilizer control

Pros:
Sound quality is fantastic ‚ò∫Ô∏è
BT connectivity is also great

Over all go for it.",4
Only one thing I can say for the beat lovers. GO FOR IT. Sound quality is top notch. Music playing at Max volume without any distortion. I can find only one drawback in this music system at this price is the Bass Controller. Though it doesn't affect the sound quality at all. I played it on 31st night at my home. It rocked the party pretty well. My friends are in love with it too. Value for money guys.,4
"Sound quality zabardast . But it's only good if you want to use with your PC or laptop. you cant forward or backward the song while you are using with USB mode. Because remote has next or previous buttons .
There is no control for bass button.
No display. There is no favorite song section button.",3
"Like the model name implies, this is tuned to maximize bass. Not at all flat unlike some reviews mentioned. If you don't want to get a headache with excessive bass boom, you need to use some kind of an equaliser. Sounds satisfactory for the price, while using linein and some heavy equaliser settings on Spotify. Waiting to test with a better DAC. Bluetooth is convenient but quality is bad over BT, no aptx hd or anything like that.",1
"This is best 2.1 music systum in this range...
Sony D40 ka baap
Philips 8085 Ka dada
LG ka nana...
This systum is surprise for me.. because JBL System in thsi price...wow
3999 me kudaa aata hai but Hero leliya",5
The sound quality is very good on thses speakers. There is one thing that is really missing on thses speakers is HDMI arc connectivity you cannot connect these speakers to TV with HDMI. the aux output from the Tv is on that great. So beaware if you are buying these for TV and your tv doesn't have Bluetooth connectivity.,4
"Got it in the Lighting Deal at the price of 3799‚Çπ, by far this is the best 2.1 Sound System you can buy under 5000‚Çπ. I would highly recommend this product rather then any F&D or any other brand sprakers, wait for sale to come and grab the deal, 10/10.",5
"One of the best home theater...
What a bass....
Overall best sond system in this price..
HARMAN BRAND....
BAJAR ME KAFI BRAND HAI PAR HARMAN KE AAGE SAB FAIL HAI.
Tata motors (ranj rovar)me yah HARMAN system company fitted milty hai.... best in sound
Thanks amazon",5
"Just the right 2.1 I was looking for. The best part is the Bass is just right with this one. BT connection happens fast, there is Blue LED ring which looks super cool and it can be turned off, Speakers auto shut if not in use for prolonged period. Haven't observed any cons to mention here yet.",5
"This product does not have a display so you cannot see at which level the volume and bass is coming. Also it does not have bass control nob to adjust the bass, and bass is only effective when you are listening this on high volume and on low volume bass is not effective. Disappointed",1
Loud and clear sound. The clarity of the sound is impressive and no doubt about that. Only problem is you can't control the bass and it makes some problems while playing the high bass audios. Rest is good and worth buying under 5k,4
Artificially boosted bass may be good for parties & disco but it is terrible for just listening to music. The bass is all boom-boom and it becomes unpleasant very soon. If you are looking for a normal balanced flat frequency response then this is not for you.,2
"Bluetooth connectivity very easy and fast process then remote control used friendly but Remot quality very cheap,and sound quality experience fantastic. And Warranty also 1year (manufacturing warranty)",5
"Sound quality is very good, each and every frequency of sound is audible...as both left & right speaker are of full range...they also contribute in bass production. 50watt RMS is enough for a big sized room or a decent sized hall.

Few drawbacks are there in this system
1) remote or subwoofer both doesn't have bass controller
2) subwoofer light doesn't glow in perfect sync with music.
3)no display screen

But overall this product is very good",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 You touched my heart jbl

Awesome sound
Bass is just too good
Close your eyes and buy this product
This is worthy product in 5000 rupees",5
"You can't control its base manually. When you play video on YouTube or Netflix or prime you cant reduce the base to zero.

You must have to listen to that annoying base all the time ,you can just slightly reduce it.

While watching news it's worthless.",1
The tops are extremely clean and clear. The subwoofer is responsive. Bass isn't very deep which is expected for this size and price of woofer. Overall sounds very good for music as well as Movies.,5
"It was working fine untill one month of its purchase, one side of the speaker malfunctioned and stopped working. Pathetic after sales service by JBL. Have already contacted them thrice and still now getting a consolation that they're going to replace it. But unfortunately they are trying to hide behind the bush.

Update:
Got the replacement after a month.
And guess what it‚Äôs still working at it best.
Will definitely recommend to try this.",4
"Speaker system is good. It is very nice in the price segment. Sound is not harsh but only drawback there is no bass control by speaker, though you can control by your app in you mobile if you playing music by Bluetooth. Please don't expect Instruments separation. You will listen instruments in your music but coz of overpowering bass you cant differentiate them. Rest is good. Keep in mind its what you getting for what you paying. Good for EDMs. If you are a serious music lover you can give a pass.",4
Sound is loud but not thumping bass effect,2
"Jbl rocks,
It has a rich bass, sound clarity from tweeters is good,
All three modes are fab
Connection to pc through aux is also amazing.
At last its a good product, purchase will be best for one room.
But the sad thing is that there is no bass control.
But i prefer that u should take this speaker for home audio use, mainly for bluetooth..",4
"Speakers are goo but bass is too low.
Bass quality is not that heavy.
In some songs the bass feel like a cheap one.
And in my laptop, i cannot control volume using my laptop volume. All matter is the speaker volume
Finally returning it",3
I tested this system.treble or vocal are good but bass below average.i tested at my laptop.when i turn up full volume subwoofer's cabinet sounds like the other way. Bass lovers don't buy this.im very disappointed from Harman. I returned this,1
"Poor sound quality of the product it's waste of money, I called amazon for return they denied will not take it back online has a policy of return if I don't like it.
I suggest my friends not to purchase from Amazon as am deleting the app from my mobile forever.",1
"Loud ,
Heavy bass (best for bass lovers)
Vocals are average because of heavy bass though you can control it by and equilizer on smartphone then it will became good
Fast and easy to connect",5
"Sound Output 4/5
Woofer 3.5/5
Loudness 4/5
Could have been more better for loudness and woofer performance. After all it's 4.5k only for speakers.",4
"No bass controller, the bass is very over powering so you have to compromise with the highs and the mids. Takes all the fun away. I am really disappointed with the product.",1
"Gud one , but remote or speaker dosent have any digital indication while increase or decrease in volume and usage of one month time , my left speaker have issue, sound output got stopped in left speaker, even tried changing aux cable the problem remain same , unexpected in one month time the speaker got issue",2
"Sound system is super...
Bluetooth fast connect
Remote very small . Some better big size same as.",5
It‚Äôs bang for the buck for sure. Bass is good. Works great with tv too. The other option for this budget is the tiny Bluetooth speakers which doesn‚Äôt have good output. Good deal overall.,5
Nice base effect and performance. Remote control is little bit poor performance but remaining are good. Who are the people are expecting 2.1 for only base effect it's recommended.,5
"Superb product by Harman, satisfied with purchase, sound quality is very clear with good bass effect. Initially I received damaged piece but thanks to Amazon customer team for prompt support and got defective piece replaced within 2 day of complaint.... Highly satisfied with Amazon purchase",5
"Not Good.
Just average product.
No Base control.
Loudly & clarity sound ok.
and Bass is Average....",3
"Pros- Sound quality is Cristal clear. Good configuration of system. overall product is good. Bass is exellent

First i have recieved but amazon has replaced product very quick. I give highest star to amazon and service.

Cons- First one speaker was not working. Now 3.5mm jack cable is defective.Missing thing is digital display, fm, bass control..",5
"It's good value for money with this type of sound quality by Harman.And good aux, bluetooth & pendrive connection for music & surprise its got blue led also in woofer.",5
Good no issue only to pick up the delivery I had to travel almost 2km for the same this was frist time I was disappointed with the delivery done by Amazon,5
"Worst sound starting (So loud) Poor Bluetooth connectivity, no folder selection for USB song, no separate app for audio... totally waste of money. the sound not comparatively to JBL. Its local audio with very less options.",2
"Audiophile's music system. Flat eq response - every sound is reproduced as it was recorded with awesome clarity. For big bass one needs to
tweek the bass boost in the music
Apps. From the house of Harman who also produce JBL so the music quality is awesome - crisp and bassy. It's sufficiently loud for a large room with 50 W RMS",4
"Just go for it and you will love it. Sounds amazing and u will feel this is enough to fill your whole house with music. Music brought to life by infinity. Trust me it's a honest review and u will feel the thump crisp and clear.

Bass - 5 out if 5
Treble - 5 out of 5
Bluetooth connectivity -5 out of 5
Remote excellent",5
If you get for less than 4K then purchase justified. Price wise excellent performance. Bass is amazing. It's like cinema experience(for small to medium room).,4
"Awesome crystal clear bass feels like 120watt subwoofer, the blue sound effects led in the front is amazing looking like dj light, satellite speakers was average, Bluetooth is super fast & it connected only in one tap, and remote is good but it was very lightweight and not looking premium or comfortable üî•otherwise I Love this product ‚ù§Ô∏è and my family üë™ also.",5
"You can listen music more then 10 hour without any headache even I‚Äôm used this 14 hours a day and saying this after using 2 weak.
Music is so clear and bass are a also good
Go for it trust me You will never feel cheated with the sound",5
"Tends to distort a bit if you play at high volumes ( more than 70%). However we don't use that high volume mostly.! Else everything is perfect.! Sound signature is very good.!
Could have been better if there's an option to control the Bass.",4
"Harman infinity the name is enough to say. 1) The sound and bass is awesome.
2) Even the Bluetooth connectivity is great.
3) Woofer cabinet looks premium.
4) It is good enough to shake your room.
5) woofer size and weight is also big. They mentioned small.

Must buy product.",5
"The sound is truly awesome. Bluetooth connectivity is quick. I also have fenda speakers, but Infinity is better than that.The absense of bass button makes no difference. It delivers balanced sound.",5
"If you like sounds dont go for this one, purchased it and not happy about the product and applied for a replacement but seems there is no sound clarity. couldn't hear the voice. There is alot of good speakers for this price.",1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 as i m already a infinity speaker customer before I purchased fuze700, and now this one is second product from Infinity, Nice bass, full room feels the thumpness....... awesome product",5
"The product is absolute superb. I loved the sound quality and the bass is just amazing. I just have one issue, the packaging. Not the amazon packaging but the JBL box which contained the speakers was torn and really damaged from all sides. It was just stuck together with the help of cello tape which was not at all satisfactory.",4
I purchased this system because its 100W. It has a tremendous power and you can play it as long as you want. The sound quality is just awesome. Bluetooth connectivity is very smooth and easy. Look is also great. One should definitely go for this system. You can not buy more powerfull system than this one.,5
Awesome Home Theatre.. Best speakers below 5000. I used JBL Cinema sb 150. I bought this Home Theatre for gift someone. This Home Theatre sounds similar to JBL. Beats ar really so much..,5
"There is no control to adjust the bass. The low ranges are very boomy almost giving an headache. I had to install a windows 10 equalizer to lower the bass to make it sound more acceptable. Beware, the bass is not tight, but very boomy.",3
"Speaker's are so powerful but the issue is with woofer because its is not as expected.
Woofer bass is not that good.
The quality of speaker's and woofer box is really good.
Bluetooth connectivity is also good we can use it from around 8ft.",3
If u plan to buy this product so you should buy any other product in this product i didn't find 100 watt sound. It like 30 watt cheap sound if you plan then go to GIZMORE SQUAD speaker system.,2
"Sound quality
Bluetooth connectivity
Bass level
Highs and lows

Everything is really just amazing.
Please just buy it without a doubt.
It a bang for the price.
Got it for 4200. But even at 5k it's the best speaker out there",5
"The very second day it stopped working. Power does not get turned on. Service ridiculous. Lodged a complaint a month back but the part not replaced. Totally a waste of time effort and monies on this product.
Only a brand new replacement can help",1
"Awesome sound quality, blutooth connect is really fast, remote control looks very good. Total package is really worth for money. If anyone has a budget of 5000, just go for this sound system from JBL. Its above excellent & should get 10stars.

Only thing is remote control battery is not aaa battery, its lithium cell round shaped battery of 3V.",5
"I liked the sound . I was bothered about the company bcz purchasing first time. It has clear and crystal sound and bass quality . It has no bass button because it, itself maintain the bass according to songs . Go blindly for this.",5
"Very good speaker, brand name itself is sufficient... Product was delivered promptly - I was little doubtful, as I saw the deliveryman throwing the box from his vehicle on to the floor... when I played it, wow... superb.... still its working...",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 At high volume sound is not clear. If you want to play with low volume then voice is clear otherwise not.
However Amazon is a Great brand and I am more then happy with there quality service with step they took and accept the return at earliest convenience.",5
"The sound quality is decent at this price. The cons are : no provision for wall mounting the speakers, the buttons on the remote are hard to press",4
"Awesome sound quality.. Game mode.. music mode.. movie mode...
6.5"" sub woofer gives massive thumping bass..and the look and design are gorgeous..
3.4""*2 Speakers gives superb tweet sounds in music mode..
9.5/10 is my score..
Treble and bass adjusting feature is not there.. else 10/10 score",4
"I liked this product for reason affordable price, good output, bass is good, clarity of music, movie is remarkable. Lacks Bass control nob, on screen display.",4
"More than ample loudness for me, but that's the only good thing about this set. Sound lacks clarity. Expected a lot better sound quality from a Harman product. Disappointed.",2
The main issue is that lack of bass controls. Hence where you place is matter a lot along source inputs. It‚Äôs quite frustrating and I would recommend against it for this singular issue. Also sound quality is at best mediocre.,2
The bass is really good and has the required thump.The clarity is also really good.Adjust equalizer on your phone or pc for the best possible experience.,5
"Excellent product in the range
1.sound is up to mark
2. Bass/trable adjustments is absent
3.bluetooth connective is very good
4.sound output calmed 100W in Amazon details But it‚Äôs around 40 to 50W only
Recommend to purchase for 250 to300 sq foot room",5
"I played it on High and full volume and first time felt the power of True Brand JBL with this price range. at full volume no sound tearing still somehow the music was super composed . and It has one more feature if its not working in use than it auto shut off to save energy.
one Must try this out",5
Continuously comes volume bar indication on my mobile life side so I am not satisfied other wise product was good better experience but only this blutooth irritates me ASAP send me another one,5
Doesn't work with aux cables and distortion in output,1
"simply awesum.
It thrills my 20x16 ft hall. Combined with my Sony TV. Clarity of speakers is No.1. Bass is Awesum. I think its one of the best in this Price Range. The Harman Brand power. Recommended.",5

"This is a great deal for real good sound. Though there is no bass control, the default setting is ideal. Clear, powerful bass. Crisp, clear mid-level sound. Snare sounds perfect. I love it! That I got it at around 50% off during a sale just made my day. If you are music lover and want something affordable and classy, get this system.",4
"Pros
This thing has amazing sound quality. You don't need bass or treble control because already tuned sound is really great.
I've tried other speakers from FD Philips LG Sony but none match sound quality of this one in this price segment.
Cons
Visual display is not present.",5
Product was good. The remote failed to work,2
Sound clarity is below average . But it‚Äôs loud. Two side speakers don‚Äôt have tweeters..it‚Äôs a full range speaker. I feel jbl go have better detailing. As they mentioned deep bass it means don‚Äôt expect punchy base,3
A fantastic product from JBL. Brilliant sound and can be used as a PC multimedia player or a Bluetooth speaker for my mobile. Happy with the purchase.,5
"Really good speakers for a small or personal room.

Sound clarity and Base is perfectly balanced..

Keep remember this speakers are good for PC and Small size room.

I don't think that they will sound good in a Big Room or Hall.",5
"Being an audiophile myself & having owned JBL Line arrays , this is a superb sound system & unbeatable value for the money ! I would recommend buying it without thinking twice.",5
"All good, but the remote control doesn't work at all. Subwoofer is also good quality. All over satisfactory but I wish the remote control would have been working",5
"i think that i received a fake speaker
coz its sound is bursting
and has a crackling voice.
Important thing : Amazon is claming that it has 100 watt peak output but when i received the box, on the box its printed that it gives 50watt output",1
"Excellent product. Small & light & easy to carry if required. Excellent sound quality, with a supercute mini remote, & super-easy bluetooth connectivity. I am overjoyed with this purchase. This product is much more than what I expected it to be. üëåüèªüòÅ",5

The Bass Box Is Very Big. The Bass Is Like Car Bass Tube. My Recommendation Buy It Now Hurry üòØ,5
"It is working fine. My only issue is, as you increase volume, sound quality gets really bad. If you use it 60-70% volume it will work perfect.
It didn't bother me much because for me 60% worked pretty fine. But for its price it should hv worked better. üôÇ",3

Please add a display so that one can see on which mode it is running, or add different lights for different functions",4
This speaker is awasome. Sound quality of this is very good and actual depends on file of the music. There is no bass controller in this speaker system. I like this harman product. Thanks.,5

No Bass. No bass volume available. Sound quality is good. But Bass not available. Hard Rock Name not suitable for this product. I'm not suggest you to purchase. F&d Speakers are better than jbl infinity hard rock. I'm not satisfied.,1
Bass is great .There is no nob to control bass.Also Bluetooth connection is fair not good.Not flat frequency response,5

Must buy for 2.1 audio lovers.,5
Volume is high at start. Would have been better if had volume & bass control on kyhe subwoofer. Sound clarity is awesome even at high volumes.,5
Only good for music and if you have DJ taste. No control for bass which makes movie experience really bad. All I could hear is high thumping sound with no clarity on dialogues. Wish i could return it.,3

"Purchased this 2.1 using my wife's Amazon Prime account. Received decent discounts and fast delivery.
The build quality of the speakers is good and looks premium.
On the connectivity front, it has Aux and Bluetooth which work flawlessly.
The Bluetooth connection is fast and works seamlessly. Aux is of decent quality but the chord is not too long. Average in this segment.
Now for the sound. Please note that there is no way to adjust to the Bass / Treble on this thing. You get EQ options - Game / Music / Movies of which Music is default selected when you switch it on. This mode has the best sound of the 3 modes.
There is also an Eco mode which will automatically switch off the system if it is not in use. I have kept it off since it doesn't matter to me and it is always in use.
Now the sound quality on this system is nowhere comparable to the competitors such as F&D. I own an F&D 550x and that sounds much more powerful compared to this. I also own a Samsung HWK20 2.1 speaker which sounds the best of all 3 with crisp treble, great vocals, and deep bass.
The remote that comes with this infinity system is tiny and easy to lose, but it works well.
Overall I would not recommend this system to anyone who wants great bass and treble with their audio. This is good enough for connecting with TV for regular TV Soaps, Movies, and Music if you are not satisfied with TV audio and need something on a budget. I would still recommend going in for F&D or Samsung which gives much better bang for the money.",3
"Sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity was awesome. Base sound extraordinary..
I felt one thing was need to be upgrad in this sound system was when power cut happens without remote or pressing on button for a couple of seconds can't switch on the system it should switch on automatically. So far I never tried with pendrive and AUX cable..",4
"I must say, I'm not disappointed by this speaker. The sound quality is much better than I expected. But then, of course, I know all about JBL & Infinity and I have listened to some of their best speakers, bookshelf or floorstanders before. So, this little-BIG 2.1 speaker didn't disappoint.

I applaud Amazon for their efficiency in delivering the product well within their promised duration, especially in this pandemic.

The satellites are obviously made of plastic, but that is to be expected from a speaker at this price range, and the sub is bigger than I expected as well. It housed a 6.5"" driver with lighting in the front (which can be annoying at night time, I'm beginning to realize, but not a deal breaker).

So, my overall impression of the speaker is excellent, exceeding expectations! Haven't really tested the bluetooth connection as I really didn't use bluetooth that much.",4
"If you are looking good speakers for home listening, then definitely go for it, being an audiophile, i can say that the sound quality is at par, if your are think about to have BASS alot then you will might feel down because BASS is not that too high, but yes its not bad also, MID and TREBAL are little higher then BASS, So BASS is little low here. If you buy Under ‚Çπ4000, You will not go wrong with it.
There is No BASS n TREBLE Control, so Don't worry about setting them.

Overall it's a product that meant for casual, daily low volume listening , with little less BASS and not for parties.",4
very bad service from amazone at first the product is delivered by 3rd party courier service since amazone facilities available in my location second the product is faulty seems like refurbished and hence applyed for replacement so very bad service I continuous keep calling amazone to take my product back but like always fake promise more than 6 days now no one come to receive amazone office is 500m far from my home then also they have no time to pickup my product,3
"My genuine review

It produces sound with good Clearity and sufficient bass, remote control is the thing i dont like. Vocals are also sharp and clear. Missing bass control knob at this price range (especially to reduce bass).. sattelite speaker wire is too short.

May be i felt heavy bass due to small room.

Sound quality (vocals and crisp) : 4.5/5
Bass : 4/5
Design: 4/5",4

I bought it offline. The 2.1 speaker system has decent sound quality and loudness. It would be 5 star if they could have provided bass volume option controls to boost a bit more .,3
"It's nice. Bass is moderate. I guess those who are saying they dont even get 5 feet range in bluetooth, i guess they got faulty product. Do exhange. I am getting around 8-10 ft. Didnt try beyond that yet. Sound quality and treble is 5 star. And bass is around 3.5 - 4 star. Overall good",5
"After a month research i bought this infinity speaker , i should admit it that you would never get this kind of product any where else at this price , sound is crystal clear , Bluetooth connectivity is so efficient that it can picks singla at even at my next bedroom which is 20 feet away . i loved it .the only drawback i felt is the remote which is very tiny and has only basic functions.",5
The Actual Wattage is 12.5Wx2 (Satellite )+25W(Woofer) = 50 Watt Total (RMS).,1

Really amazing bass. F&d ka boss infinity by JBL.",5
"i got this product for 3150 and its worth of it. the bass is really good at this price point.boat is a 3rd grade company.for budget price u can go for logitech jbl philips edifier.dont compare this speaker with 5000-10,000 speaker. u cannot compare maruti 800 with",4
"Liked the build, aesthetics, sound, operations. Good quality. Suitable for a compact home theatre & multipurpose music system with all connectivity options",5
"I have not boughtthis from Amazon.
Please dont buy this product.
The product is buggy. The aux gets disconnected frequently when I switch channels in TV. I can see that there are other people who posted the same issue above. So this is a common issue in this series.",1
"I just can't feel the 100 output power you are saying, I have a 50 output power speaker and wanted to upgrade, but they have the same power output and my old speaker are even the best and smaller.

Please, stop fooling us with your product description",3
"If u are looking for a low budget Best Sounding Bluetooth Home Theatre,Then my friend u have come to the right place buy it without thinking twice. Thanks Amazon loved it I don't know much about other expensive speakers but at this price range this is very best :)",5
Very worst product . No bass controll and treble controll that too with low quality remote .High price. I ordered the product during Holi sale for4499 and at the tike of delivery showing 5499 . Showing a 1000 rupees hike .very bad,1
"Amazing sound, there's no doubt in my mind this is one of the best 2.1 chennal speaker on amazon, killer bass
Sound quality compare to this nothing in this price that also from JBL. There's no distortion of any shout at full volume and the the remote and Bluetooth also good",5
"Bohot sexy speakers hy but maine aur zada saste me liye the 3799 ka from wallmart .
BTW feature amd sound quality wise apne proce koi justify karte hy even for 5k .",5
Don't forget u r paying 4k only..so don't expect beyond that..n it's really worth d money . U ll not get a better product in dis price range. Gud sound clarity n bass reasonable..bass effect changes according to d woofer placement so if u feel like r not getting enough bass try to change d place of woofer.,4

Please don't buy infinity's products. I first heard they were JBL's sub brand but that's only in its name. On the other side jbl or harman customer service representatives don't even know what to do for my damaged product that's only being used for 1 month.,1
"What I like:
1. Gives you a feel good ownership :)
2. Size of the Speakers
3. Lives upto the brand name
4. Signature sound of JBL
5. Good Bass. You dont need an enclosure to increase the throw
6. The Blue Light on the Woofer dome is like a cherry on the cake
7. Feel free to pump the music on LOUD volume
8. Sound Modes: Movie, Music and Game

What I dislike:
1. The Remote has a very short range and for some reason the one I got doesnt work that well as I have to press the power button many a times to toggle the operation",4

Most disgusting service i ever got...no aux port and definitely not for PC,1

Length is satellite speakers wire is very less... It's length is like you have to arrange it in circle of diameter 5 feet to and you have to sit in to enjoy surround experience... Not able to connect to TV. Not sure whether the issue is with TV. Power cable length is also too small. Just 2 feet length. Apart from that it's ok..,3

Jai made in india",5
"I Loved this Home Theatre. Sound Quality is Superb. Built in quality is good in this price range. If you want a good ear piece home theatre in reasonable price go for it without thinking any other brands. It's completely Indian made and Seller will help you all the way. Here is my 15 Weeks experience.

Sound Quality : Superb
Built in Quality : Good
Bass : out standing
Seller Support : Outstanding
Remote : Need to Improve but good in this price range
Overall : Extraordinary Product",5
"I was confused before buying this product . But after buying this music system , I am happy . Bass is Punch and vocals are clear . using this music system continuously for 8 hours . No problem persist . Clarity is super . My friends does'nt believe this home theatre is under 2000 rupees . I using this home theatre for my photo studio . Good product for small rooms and shops . Go for it friends . Well done TRONICA . edit 12 Feb 2020 ... Works great till today ... 1year completed , no single problem . Very happy for this home theatre . EDIT DATE 15 november 2020 ....not a single problem till today ( AV cable changed today for humming sound from AV computer connection , fault of AV cable ..... Home Theatre is working awesome till today )",5
"It's really very nice , I am very happy to buy it , the sound quality is very nice and also bass system is supperb , specially bluetooth system very nice and EXCELLENT, I like very much this because I can listen my own sung song in mobile app through this Bluetooth. over all this is very nice product , and also service is fast and very helpful of tronica.
Thank you very much TRONICA.",5
Sound and bass good.bt one speaker pin not working properly. It's different like above the image .what I should do pls?,5
"Im really dissapointed with this product . Built quiality , sound quality is bad . I received with a crack on one of the satellites.",1
"No surround sound,no sound clarity,
Cannot operate bass from remote ,no lengthy cables for satillite speakers
Overall not satisfied",2
"After buying when i first time used it the sound quality was quite good, but from the second time and after that when ever using it the sound quality is very low and broken. I thought the problem might be due to cable and all but i have tried everything but it seems the problem is with the product only. Its kept in the same condition like when bought it and not all enjoying listening from it.",1
Only from selected phone connected properly and giving proper sound ..if I connect from any other phone than Samsung sound is very very low.. via Bluetooth.. otherwise sound quality bass is superb.. but little disappointed because of this issue.. hope it get solved soon ..,5
"Best woofer and Crystal clear audio and subwoofer are very good at this price range. awesome bass, mind blowing sound.i would recommend to go for these ones. May Be the Other Company can never provide such quality at these price range......thank u Tronica :). The sound shakes my room that also with half volume.if I do full volume neighborhood will complain hahaha.works fine with my PC.....and I use Bluetooth to listen also",5
"Despite having low quality connector and plastic kinda feels cheap as well. But sound quality is not compromised. @2.5K it will surprise you for its bass and sound. I will recommend this product over other in this price segment. Bass is punchy and vocals are perfect, watching movie will be nice in this one. One Really good thing about this product is when you turn it on again, it will start where you left it. It will pair your device and continue to start playing the song(like my Sony music system in the car) awesome at this price.
But it is not as per my liking, thus returning the product I will invest more and buy some heavy bass high power speakers.
It is perfect for small room, you can go for it.
Kudos to Tronica and Mr. Manjeet for sound quality but there is a lot of room to work on the looks and plastic quality.",5
"It's been sometime since I got this Home Theater system. One thing that I need to make myself aware is that these products aren't meant to last and you get what you paid for. I often wished we could buy just the Subwoofer without the speaker, as speakers can outlive the subwoofers.
For the time I had this product, I had the immense pleasure listening to the music via bluetooth which was an incredible experience. Sadly to my misfortune yesterday, I turned on the music through bluetooth (as usual) and I went away to the next room. The sound suddenly dropped and the bass sound was continuously on and didn't turn off and the back of the Home Theater was very hot when I touch it and I switched off the power when I saw smoke coming out from the bass-hole. There was no electrical issues in my house and I used to play songs during the weekends for hours and I used to work out, but yesterday I could only listen to my song just for 30 minutes and that was the end. I remember when I got the product, the back panel did heat and I often wondered why it was heating so much, but yesterday when I got a friend to take apart the home theater, he said this was all patch up and glue work and the board/chipset wasn't even fit for a 5.1 Surround sound. My friend explained stating the chipset/board had only 3 ICs meant for a 2.1 channel and not for a 5.1 channel, the broad that was inside the home theater couldn't sustain and it gave up to my better understanding. Anyways thank you Tronica, I gotta alteast enjoy the best experience for a year and half.",3
This item differs from the one displayed on the website. All satellite speakers are of the same size and build quality is poor. There is a constant humming sound when any device is connected by Bluetooth,1
Product is really superb. Sound quality is awesome at this price range couldn't have been much better..Much more than expected.,5
"The bass box started producing some rumbling noise after a month.
Yes this is a very budget friendly 5.1 speaker. Keep in mind this is not a surround sound speaker. It is just a speaker set with 5 satellites and 1 woofer which amplifies sound and is actually a 2.1 system. The sound quality from the satellites are pretty decent, its clear and crisp with more treble. Coming to the woofer, the quality of bass is very flat, not that great but it is functional. Overall built quality of woofer is very poor as it had some cracks, but the satellite speakers are built well. If your budget is low, you may go for this if you plan on using it in a small room. Only suggestion to the company is that they can improve the built and bass quality of the woofer a little more. Not recommended honestly, waste of money. Should hve returned it.",1
I purchase it but 2music spekar was not working that's problem morover they call me &said why u return it why not repair I said it was not working in starting then I don't want it repair I want rrtrun it..... Conclusion if we bought any thing new then we don't want Repair that thing just I thing it's Bed of saller madem who call me Shame on you.... Fistly U should cheq ur product after get Ready to ship it's your first Response vility if u r a good saller then..... Hate offu,2
Product is too bad because i have purchase few days earlier only one day it is working after that stoped then i will change again same speaker with Amazon again same problem one speaker is stoped working dont buy it but sound quality is good but many problem thease are Chinese speakers,3
"The 5.1 system is small in size but packs a punch. I use it for my guitar sound monitoring, the mixer aux output is given to the speakers through its aux ports. The sound is like any other 40 W speak without distortion, it picks up the bass of the 6E string very nicely and the satellite speakers respond to the other strings well.
The cables provided are of poor quality and I needed a separate set. The front AUX is iffy. Here are the pros and cons :

Pros
1. Great price for a 5.1
2. Plays with an audio mixer easily
3. The woofer is particularly good
4. The AUX port on the front is a good option

Cons
1. Never tried it with a television, though have no doubt it will work
2. AUX jack in the front gives iffy sound, I know cause I returned the first piece to get the second one.
3. The description is too elaborate and reality different",4
"I bought this product out of curiosity and i found out a hidden gem. Yeah, it's the best product in this price range. Bass is quite good depending on the connection. Clarity is good too. But you wont hear the deepest bass.
Customer support is extraordinary. Never seen any company give this much attention to their customer before. I had some rattling sound on one of the speaker and i tried to replace it and they did call me the next day and sent me a new speaker with no questions asked. A little too good don't you think ? And they were in touch with me even after i got my replacement. Such nice peoples. One will never feel their money got wasted in any manner. I highly recommend to try it and top notch support is guaranteed.

(P.S. Good for small rooms. 10x12 room would be ideal. Since my room is too big, the bass gets lost somewhere across the room üòÖ)",5
Man this is really awesome 5.1 speakers in this price range it is a awesome deal without any second thoughts just go for it. Iam writing this review after fully testing this for a month. Just awesome. I watch youtube movies and amazon prime video movies wow awesome theater experience. Why pay 10k 20k for other brands I just dont understand. Rhanks to the manufacturer who can deliver such a awesome product in this price range. I will recommend this just go for it with out any doubt.,5
"Very good product.
Blue tooth connectivity is very good. Bass is good. Over all the product is superb!
Customer service is very Nice and prompt. They respond to me immediately and solve all the issues.",5
"I know you'll doubt yourself before buying this, but don't go after the brand name popularity. If you're trying to spend least amount of money to get the best you can, go for this. Being a musician and a music lover for long, I'm saying this: Tronica has done a good job with the bass. It's amazingly deep at this price. I'm not comparing it to those signature companies, but at this price, you're really getting good stuff.

Trebele is also pretty good and speakers produce crisp sound.

If I have to spend as less as possible, I'll go for this one.",5
"Great sound quality. I purchased for Bluetooth connectivity for MI TV and is perfectly paired with good sound coverage of lower and upper frequencies. I believe one cannot get this quality for this amount from any other product. Blindly go for it, unless, of course, you are a brand freak and expect pinnacle of the quality.",5
"I liked this music system very much. Good SOUND quantity, reception of FM, bluetooth. Bass is also very decent. Customer service is always available on phone. I am very much satisfied. I got a little problem with and contacted the seller over phone. They sent new sound card over courier and advised to install it by local technician. Technician Charges were also reimbursed by Paytm. Now my system is playing superbly",5
Pros: gd product at this price. Sound quality is good. Enjoying home theatre experience. But u cannot expect the quality of sound as well as the product keeping in mind of Rs.20000/- phillips or yamaha brand. With low budget home theatre experience..Yes..This is the product for it. Its working very well. No defects and timed delivery too.,5
Totally wast of money,1
"I got in 1950rs in dailydeals.
After using 3month it was fantastic product within under 2000rs.
Bass was unbelievable.sound quality was clear.
But need to improve AUX cable connection.it was very low sound in aux.
For home Ganpati puja it was best for sound.",5
"Hi Dear All,
I am really impressed with the features that I got in this speakers, it came with 5 speakers, in which 2 are the more sounded one thats is big satellite speaker one.
I will definately going to recommend you to buy it, hope you will also like it :)
And also services are fine from this company Tronica.

Regards,",5
"good product, remot control and bluetooth work properly. But I facing problem in sd card reading. My sd card didn't read by sd card slot. But in card reader it work properly. Please tell what is problem in card Reading through sd card slot. I also don't know upto how much GB sd card this product support. So please clear it.

In my product I got everything perfect except Little problem reading of SD card through sd card slot. And I wish that tronica team will clear this problem soon. Thanks",4
"Pathetic build.

Left side speakers are not working just after a month of purchasing it.",1
"This is genuinely writing the review.
I bought this product based on review what i read here but quality of sound is too dull in sense of all. You will not get satisfied performance of instruments.

I return it back and prefer to buy other brand's system.",1

The product is not 5.1 after tried many methods I understand it's not 5.1. after connecting i found missing voices in all 5.1 movies I played.. and games I played..some times vocal some time BG music..and day by day the voice become low and clarity become bad..also... And wire's are too short (length) for a 5.1. Only for some stereo movies the sound felt great.. I tried not to return it but I tried all things to get a 5.1 result .. but no use...,2
"I was wondering if I'd have to add 'for the price' but thankfully, no. It's a great product irregardless of the price. It's cheap, but quality. Made in India too. Also, the service is excellent. My problem was personally taken care of by the people in the company.",5
"The bass of the product not working, requested a replacement of the product, got the replacement in less than one day.. the new product is good, it‚Äôs value for money.",4
I have brought three in last 1 month from Amazon itself as wedding gift. I have heard great things about the product from the ones I have gifted it to. Price was the initial go to for me and I was not sure about the product quality but the good words from my loved ones about the quality made me feel good about my decision to go for it. Way to go tronica..,5
Truly proud to use a product made by Indians. Must buy one. It's having Bluetooth features. Gets connected with the mobile. Great sound quality,5
"I recommend this to noisy bass lovers but not for the true sound lover.
If u prefer ultra-clear and some quality stuff, well u won't get into this price range. But the company did well in the budget and the facilities are impressive.
Build quality is very casual(average), it's Bluetooth and aux connectivity are great.",3
"Really bad that all I want to say,the port for the speakers are not functioning. The remote I got it's broken... why guys why are you so irresponsible..... next time for any customer just check twice make sure everything is fine .",2
"I was a fan of tronica music systems but this time it completely disappointed me, this home theatre is completely a waste product, low sound quality, worst bass, worst loudness even a low cost BT speaker is louder than this. Tronica this time you went horrible.",1
"I was confused before buying this product . But after buying this music system , I am happy . Bass is Punch and vocals are clear . using this music system continuously for 8 hours . No problem persist . Clarity is super . My friends does'nt believe this home theatre is under 2000 rupees . I using this home theatre for my office.",4
This is not good... I have purchase this product the very first day in the morning it started working good and in the evening its gives lot of problem... I used this speaker only for a day... Frnds a kind request please don't buy this product,1
"I really like the price range that tronica brand giving us..... And it's is best value for money......
I just open the new seal pack box.....there was 2 satellite speaker that are not working properly....but i call them and they fix me out....they said after 3-4 days they will send me new one....i m really happy with tronica........",5
"It's really very nice , I am very happy to buy it , the sound quality is very nice and also bass system is supperb , specially bluetooth system very nice and EXCELLENT, I like very much this because I can listen my own sung song in mobile app through this Bluetooth. over all this is very nice product , and also service is fast and very helpful of tronica.
Thank you very much TRONICA.
Warranty service is goodüôÇüôÇ",5
Really i thought it was good product but it has cause sound problem and has got defective.... As i have contacted customer care but they were neglecting and not giving response...... ( on warranty card they have told that they are happy to help but they don't help they make fool to customers)............ I will suggest that dont buy this product it is defective.........,2
"Product is very good in this range. Sound quality is also good but not like F&D.
Bass is cool but sound is not fulfill my requirement. When i attached my 2 F&D speakers with this then i realize what is missing in this item. So you can go with this item if you have low budget. If you use this in your hall or bedroom that is awesome, I usually play music in open area. Thanks",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 If your budget is under rs2500 then ,don't think just go for this one this home theater system provides the best value in his price point ,the remote control is not that good , the range is also bad , bass is really nice for this price point , overall VALUE FOR MONEY",5
"It is a really great experience for the sound effects for home theater. Sharp and crystal clear sound without any noise (even on the high volume). Had a bad experience on the part of the remote supplied as it stopped working properly after some days, however, 5-star service was provided by the supplier as it sent me another remote on the next day of complaint. Bluetooth connectivity is great. I have connected it through the TV and the experience is great for movies, tv show and sports events. It is a very good product, will recommend buying.",5
I dislike this product due to noise in right side speakers after 3 months then I went to repair and it was found that iC has created problem and replaced it after that I noticed that AUX mode left side speakers no sound then I also replaced Bluetooth module then it was okay. If you think then 500 rupees kindly refund my account as repairing charge,3
"I bout Tronica super King series 6 months ago, within one month audio inputs cable stopped working, next month Bass stopped working, and in next 10days sound quality dropped and noise disturbance increases... And since then sound quality is very bad, and agian in next few days noise disturbance increased so much that now whenever I start this speaker... Only noise is audible....
Pathetic speakers, will never recommend.",1
"Very low quality product,
Bass reflex stopped in 3 months.
Heavy treable. (No option to control)
Remote is low quality.
Audio sockets mostly folded n chipped.",1
"In one line - Intex 2.1 is much better and louder. Base is good, sound quality is good, but it's not much louder as Intex 2.1. This one gives you a home theatre experience. Those tower speaker are not good. They don't have base it's just for design. But for this price it's good and ok ok type product.",3
"Soind quality- pretty good. Loud enough at about 50-75% volume with good clarity. Can‚Äôt push it to max volume because it starts rattling. One small speaker was rattling, but plugging it in to Front seemed to fix it for now.
Remote control is decent.
Bluetooth is great. No lag between video and audio so far",4
All together built quality is not that good as its wire got broken from the end of plug point within 7 month of use.....fragile...sound quality is good for single room,3
"First of all, It's not a 5.1 speaker, just a stereo player with 5 speakers and all speakers are same. Remote is absolutely useless. But bass is nice.
The material quality, both the speaker enclosure and wires are of low quality. It produces very sharp sound and heavily distorts, producing screeching sound sometimes.

Instead of 5 speakers, they should have provided only two speakers but with better sound and material quality.",2
After 5 months it stops working and making disturbing noise while tuning fm. It is not 5.1 as mentioned. I lost my money by choosing this .just after 5 month i threw it away as shown in the picture. The plastic used in this also very bad quality it smells bad.dont waist your money,1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Bad product from Amazon
Tronica bad home theater manufacturers only 2month used and unknown sound is on",1
I was disappointed when I get this. I got a damaged product. The volume control and the bass control was broken and it went inside of the subwoofer. And the sound was not good when I connected it. Bad quality wire even though. And cannot be keep the speakers where ever we want. Because the length of the wire is not enough. Also the bad quality remote. I returned and refunded.,1
"I love it much more. sound quality and sound quality is upto mark. Really excellent product.
I suggested it for every one. because, this is the budget 5.1 home theater. and woofer also good sound.",5
Really it's a product which is good for value of money.Hi-fi sound without distraction of sound.But it's not good in Surrounding System.if u need this for small room it's really good but if you have big room really sorry...b'caz it has small length of wire for satellite speakers...Value of money,5
"Worst product ever in my lifetime

After not even 3 months of usage it stopped working

When I call customer care they still for only 3 months they would give warranty

In a local shop I tried to repair it
They said the coil is gone and nothing can be done

Doesn't even deserve 1 star . Please don't go for it

You have other nice Speakers in the same price range",1
Really I'm not except from this sounds.... Really proud of this product and 1 request for the manufacturer of the product wires are not so good... Really worried about that.... Otherwise awesome...,5
When it arrived it looked really promising. It worked well for 3 months after 3 months it really turned out to be a trash . The damn thing stopped working . If you all wanna buy for couple of months of decent sound it‚Äôs okay but it‚Äôs not durable at all . I won‚Äôt recommend it . As it‚Äôs kept in my basement occupying the space,1

Able to connect via Bluetooth as well at a Decent distance of Device. Overall satisfied with the product,5
"After just 2 months, the only 2 audio input in boofer is working . Other 3 audio inputs makes huge noise without any signals ......
It's ill mannered manufactured.

I am degrading this product...And sliced 4 stars cutting from the previously 5 stars feedback.",1

An ex ordinarily average product...I received a defective product and got exchange that also not satisfying...I can't recommend...,4
"I am editing my review after almost 8 months, I use the system very sprangily, but now I am observing that central unit is almost non functional. There is no bass effect. I don't know where to get it repaired.",1
This home theater stopped working I have to get it repaired 4 times thousand rupees are wasted that is the half of the price of this home theater,1
guys dont go fall with the discounts and low prices as the product is already compromised with the quality. so be wise and go for the branded quality.,1
"This is a good speaker for your hall (around 25*20'). It has great voice clarity and a decent bass.
This is not for people who want to shake-up the entire building.

Personally, I liked this a lot! It is decent and good.",4
It's good product at a reasonable price...sound and bass quality are also good... It can used in small birthday parties or in get togteher type functions.... I ordered these speakers in march 2020..now today is 19August 2020... Speakers are stil working good....,5

After two months it started making noises and the volume control stopped working bad experience of this product. It worked only for two months!!!!,4
"Buy @2200 only nice clear sound, medium bass
usually compatible for small room budget friendly product. if you have a very tight budget then go for it not a bad deal.",4
Its waste of money. Better to buy a reputate brand. Build up with very cheap materials. Even u can smell the cheapness. Also the quality of sound is not so good. Just giving 2* for the daring to build a 5.1 home theater in such low price.,2
"Product is just ok , not as expected.
Product stopped working, product smoked. Low quality transformer, transformer is super heating and smoked. Don't wast your hard-earned money in such fake products.",1

> Returning the material - need to look higher output home theater system.",2
Considering the price...the sound is ok...not so good and not so bad... It has many features like usb & fm... Which is appreciable...,3
What you pay what you get. It's not 5.1 and it's not home theatres . We have a three right sounds and two left sounds and central woofer sounds in one central control box. It's cheating. Even right left stereos are mismatch. Left is put in right.,3
Price worthy product it just a 2.1 comes with 5 speakers not a 5.1 hometheater and remote batteries not give in it bass is good not heavy but good for listening music.,4
"I found it very much suitable for medum hall,like 12x15 .
The sound quality is up to mark.
All given fuctions are working fine.
Only point to suggest is they must increase wire length for all the speakers.",4

"The biggest mistake of my life is buying this item.
Now the people from ""Tronica"" will just write to reach out to customer service.
The problem with this speaker is that it's sound is decreasing day by day and soon there will be no sound.

THANK YOU TRONICA FOR SUPERB PRODUCT!!

People who are willing to buy this product I would recommend to go for 2.1 it has more quality sound.

Nothing is good in this product.",1
"THOUGH THE ITEM IS QUITE GOOD BUT THE REMOTE CONTROL IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. YOU HAVE TO PRESS SOOOOOOOOOO HARDLY TO ACTIVATE ANY MODE.
IF YOU COULD REPLACE WITH BETTER ONE , IT WOULD BE VERY NICE. I TRIED WITH OTHER UNIVERSAL REMOTE ETC. BUT NOT WORKING.
LENTH OF THE SPEAKERS' WIRES ARE TOOOOOOO SHORT. CONNECTION PROBLEMS OF REAR SPEAKERS ETC
OTHERWISE ALL OTHER PERFORMANCE SOUND, FM ETC ARE QUITE GOOD. ONLY PROBLE WITH BAD REMOTE CONTROL. ( RATHER NOT WORTH REMOTE CONTROL)",5
I bought this and returned it as I'm not satisfied with the sound quality! This will be good for a small room! The speaker wires are not long! So you have to place this nearby! Very nearby! The woffer is not that great as there is no cut for the woofer on the wooden box! Woffer sound comes out from the vent that given for the air. Put some extra money and buy a branded one if bass is your main priority! Overall an okay okay product! Can be used as computer speakers but not for the TV!,3
"Good quality sound. Good bass. High volume for home use. Clear sound. Thank you.

This seller helped me by replacing with new subwoofer. My subwoofer got repair. I informed Amazon India. They gave me ph no. to contact the seller of this product. I contacted this seller, and informed that the subwoofer got repair, and i need new one. This seller sent me brand new subwoofer, and got back the old subwoofer. Thank you so much.",5
"Overall nice product, in this price range, sound n bass quality is good, but it lit lower sound n bass, for my single room its good. I am using from past few months its working well, 5 sub speaker is nice for serounding. Price is too low so ur compromise with loudness of sound n bass.
I gave 3.5 out of 5",3

"Two satellite speakers out of five are built in tower shape to provides an enhanced punch of little bass along with high decibels. This modification has improved the sound parameters widely. A set of 5 satellite speakers and 4"" sub woofer enables us to experience theatrical effect.",5
"The product is same as i want to buy in a mid range amount . Beautiful design, Clear Sound and most important is the ""Bass"" of the main speaker.
Also the customer service is very appreciable.

"I was using creative sbs a250 2.1 home theatre, and i now switched to this. I bought this as a temporary replacement but this is more than what i was expected. I was surprised of the sound quality. It is good as or better than creative a250 (sound quality). Build quality is average if you are looking around the system but good if you are looking from front sides. Best quality bass at 90hz in 9db. You can adjust to this setting in bass boost settings in windows 10 device property.",5
Ok,5
Satiesfied,4
It is very very bad product. I am very disappointed after purchase it. After purchase I use only 14days and it is stop working. After register complain both side Amazon & Philips customer care but still today above passed 2 month my problem not solved yet. They still arranging part which is faulty but not get it yet. Worst product & services. I am not not getting repair product or replacement after many time request to customer care. I suggest every one please Don't purchase.,1
"It can use as home theatre,party purpose,etc..
Speaker quality is good. But the speaker's were slightly damaged when i received apart from that this is really cool. MUST TRY",4
"I am writing this revuew after listening to the music system for 4 months, all i can say is after some time it gives you a constatntly hissing sound apart from this a nice product got it at 5400",3
"Well writing this review after thoroughly testing each feature.,Philips never compromised on the sound quality of their products..Have been using Philips audio systems since a very very long time..The expectation of products from Philips are huge as the build quality of Philips is way beyond comparison..After listening to audio from Philips 5.1 Home theatre audio systems was quite sceptical about buying a 2.1 speaker system but Philips proved me wrong..This is an awesome product designed by Philips the Bass is immersive, the audio quality is awesome and is very pleasant to listen.
Very satisfied with the quality.. Got it for around 10k after discount and card offer thanks to Amazonüòä
Pros:
1.Bass level can be increased up to 30 max but would recommend to not go beyond 18/20.
2.System volume operating range is up to 30 max.
3.Different equaliser modes available.
4.Can play audio from USB,In built FM receiver,Aux input,Optical in,Bluetooth..
5. Speakers can be used as tower speakers or as sound bar..
6.Special mention the sub-woofer is true performer from Philips as always.
7.The sound output is superb even at volume level 2 and bass level 4/6, it‚Äôs really pleasant to listen at this range at night times offcourse with ur fav playlistüòä
Cons:
1.Remote plastic quality is not acceptable from a giant like Philips could have been better -No offence
2. Could have provided treble control but that doesn‚Äôt defer the quality of the sound output it‚Äôs just to mention consumers can adjust it according to their choice of treble level.",5
"It's really good....value for money....!
I like it...!",5
"It's a powerhouse. Amazing bass, music quality is very good. A lot of options to connect with everything. I'm mainly using it through Bluetooth and connected with my TV. But FM is useless and there is no display, which station is playing. Basically it is missing multi information display. That's the only negative point. I'm using it as s sound bar but love the option that it can also be converted into 2 speakers. Also on the main console the circular volume button is really cool. Remote does what's expected. Overall really good product. Packaging was not great as they just polywrapped the box and there was no outer amazon box what you generally get. Delivery was fast.",4
"We purchase certain items looing at the face value of the brand. I have been completely befooled & have decided never to go in for any Philips product, which was once a brand in sound quality. I asked for its return but was shockingly advice to get it replaced.",1
"I, as a connoisseur, do not like too much of bass boosting. Normal about 135 Hz bass for this system is fine as per human audible bass. Treble could have been better. But you cannot tell in details unless you play for some days to stabilize speaker magnate which improves with use.
Use after some days shows lack of clarity. Not a great one. I should have preferred local assembled as available in this web or a other Chinese ones. ( this is no doubt assembled in China).

Cons: The remote is not as smooth expected.",2
"I bought them 6 months ago & they started creating problem after few days. I managed it as the return window was closed. But few days ago the speakers suddenly went off. I tried different techniques to power them on but they didn't.
Finally, I called Philips customer care & spoke to one of the idiots who wasn't interested in dealing with it. Somehow he booked an appointment & said you will receive a call in 6 working hours. I waited for that call for 2 days......
Then I called Amazon & spoke to an advisor who politely advised me to call Philips customer care again & said that if they won't help then Amazon is there to help you.
I called them again and this time somebody really called me and visited my place to see what's wrong. He took 7 days to solve the problem as he was ill (which was fine).
He changed the motherboard & now I have the speakers working in a proper way & they are giving much better sound than before. Thank you Amazon.",5
"Sound quality is good. Remote stopped working after 6 months. Have seen similar where issues with remote have been reported. Luckily I was able to find a mobile app which works with this system. Sharing the app screenshots for the benefit of others. As there is no physical on/off buttons you cannot even start the system without a remote. Hence instead of running around to service centre or going for other generic remotes, this is a much better option.

But please don't expect all functions to work on the mobile app remote. Only basic functions like on/off and volume controls are working.",3
"Worst product and service from amazon. Dont Buy! At first the delivery was well packaged but the product was defective, i ordered for an replacement though it had been replaced the product came with an another defective Issue. Worst experience ever. Never buy from amazon ! Once it came with an defective piece its okay. But even after replacing the product had still issue as i have uploaded in the picture. Beware people ! No hope of ordering from amazon again .",1
"sound is good, but remote sensor is not good. we have to press button so many time. Remote performance is very bad",4
This is the speaker i have ever wanted. Clear sound and super bass makes it a great speaker. If you are looking for something that is rich in bass you can go for it. Delivery was fast and i received it safely.,5
"I am reviewing 4 days after using the product.
The sound quality is excellent, especially the rich bass it has (with bluetooth connection through my smart phone), the sound clarity is also outstanding.

However, I could not connect it to my Videocon d2h as rca cable was not included in the box, later I purchased 2 male to 2 male rca cable from local market and connected it to my Toshiba Led Tv, unfortunately the sound quality is very poor, I couldn't get any surrounding sound.
Bluetooth connectivity is average.
Remote control should have been better for a Brand like Philips.",5
"Not an original remote of philips. Even the remote is not in working condition.
You can see in picture spelling of philips is different. Worst product. Don't spend ur money on it",1
"After too much of reading reviews and research, I decided to buy this Phillips MMS2220B on a nice amazon sale day! Got a good deal less than ‚Çπ10k price.
Though it‚Äôs non returnable through normal channel, it‚Äôs very important to give this unit its burn down time. Sound quality on the first day and output it gave after period of 8-10days (2-3hrs daily run) tremendously improved. The bass & tremble improves and it‚Äôs low voice out is amazing as well.
Phillips is anyway much better than the Chinese ones (this is made in India!) and the technology is far better!
- FM radio works well but has little distortion in some channels (maybe had to fix the antenna outdoors) but it‚Äôs still give good output.
- Bluetooth linking is the quickest !! It connects without any issues and has the best quality output
- AUX - option provided but I didn‚Äôt see any difference between Bluetooth and AUX cable.
- Optical wire - I was surprised to see the optical wire also part of the package. It‚Äôs not mentioned and I had ordered the amazon OP wire as well. Best option to connect to make your TV a home theatre !!

Best this is the Bass output. Works really well in low volumes as well. I wish they had provided tremble option as well, but it works just as good!

Don‚Äôt understand why Phillips has such a cheap looking remote control!!

This unit looks classy and suits your living room! I would say best in class in terms of looks. Speakers can be attached and wall mounted as well as one piece.

You would need to use this for min 10days to get the best output and ensure you have proper acoustic set up in room . Placing of speakers as recommended works the best !!

Best Buy during a sale!!",5
Sound quality is good and it has multiple source input which makes it one of the best speakers in the segment. But the only drawback with this product is the wire length. Both the 3.5mm connector and the wires for the satellite speakers are very small in length. At least a decent length wires should have been given so that it can be set up with proper spacing between speakers and woofer for better sound quality. 3 stars for this reason otherwise its a 5 star worthy product.,3
"This is my favourite mutlimedia system Everything was fine but the woofer started making sound after 10 days.The replacement period is not long enough.so i took it to the philips service centre they said that the woofer needs to be replaced but there is no stock with them damn!!!!. I have to wait till the end of this month.
So philips please check your products correctly before you release them into the market.",5
"It is an awesome product at this range. At first i received a defective product,and I got it replaced. Now this one is working fine. Good bass, good treble, classic looks. Friends, you can go for this product without any hesitation. Make sure after you receive the product, you get your device registered on Philips family which can be done online. Thanks.",5
"Even though in medium volume the woofer makes Humming noise which causes much disturbance.
There is no display to show the level if volume, bass etc.
Plz it Should be provided in next series.
All other features are good except woofer.",2
Sound quality poor .. Am not satisfied this product ..,1
"Bass and terrible controller is its default.
Sound is also not good.
It is best for those who wants more bass.",5
"One Speak poor quality, it has daunt...",1
"MY EXPERIENCE IS VERY BAD FOR AMAZON. I WANT TO EXCHANGE THIS PRODUCT BUT AMAZON'S EXECUTIVE SAYS THIS IS UNDER OF ELECTRONIC T&C WE ARE NOT EXCHANGE THIS PRODUCT
AND THIS PRODUCT VERY 4TH CLASS SOUND AND QUALITY",1
Great product sound quality is great everything is fine... and delivery was to earlier i was not expecting thisüòÖüòÖ,5
"I bought this on 2nd June, it worked fine till date. Now it has been started creating problem on bluetooth. I am not sure whether it is covered under warranty",1
I like so much,5
"Worst service don't buy this Philips device.
Honestly this product is amazing but I won't recommend this you to buy because Phillips worst service. It's been 3 months I purchased this product and worked very well and recently it stopped working thus it's not switching on. I contacted Philips customer service representative and they filed a complaint and they said that they will send a technician to solve this problem but I didn't get a call from them since I complained about the issue.
Now it's been 3 days but they didn't reach me regarding the issue.",1
Can say that the product is OK. But didn't meet my expectation. I was using the Creative sound system which bought in 2006 and it was working fine till last month. The fluctuation in electricity killed my sound system. Hence I thought to buy one to replace my old one. But the sound quality can't compare with my old Creative sound system. Philips made me disappointed.,4
"Sound quality aswam..
Bass quality jast wow..
Nice product i'm happy..",5
"Sound Quality, Bass is adequate for room upto12*12, anyways it's a budget mm speaker.
Experienced bt connectivity issues, It doesn't get connected even if device is alredy added to cellphone/ laptop. I had to search device everytime I turn it on and add it to the cellphone/ laptop.
Sometimes it gets disconnected if you pause music or video for just 5-10 seconds..
then you have to reconnect manually / re-pair n resume where u left, this was something I felt annoying..
If this is the issue with all units, Brand like Philips need to adress such issues since most of the people use bt connectivity nowadays than any other means.
Build quality is good for the price, except remote seems very poor quality and doesn't work sometime. Battery not provided * customer satisfaction is more than the cost of batteries I guess.
But Thanks to Amazon's best customer service / support solved my issue immediately.",3
Good product worth the price....,5
"Pros -
Great build quality
Sound is clear and crisp.
Good Sound Volume
Doesn't Distort at high volume
Treble is balanced

Cons-
Bluetooth range is terrible. Just 3-4m.
Doesn't have good base. And there's no tuning knob for it like older versions used to have.",4
"Noise like hissing sound is coming when there is no audio is present.
after using two months this Noise is unbearable and complained to Phillips Customer Care . Nothing has happened till date they are saying they will replace the unit but it almost one month is over.
switched over to my old Home theater system.
So please think twice before going for this product.",1
"The product is work investing.

Remote control has bass control
Blutooth connectivity is awesome.. even if you keep your phone in another room it catches
product design is very good
sound clarity is very good",5
The sound is very muddy. I was expecting better sound. The product was faulty when arrived so had to return it once. Not great value for money. It's a Made in China rebranded product. Instead of this buy B&H or Creative or something else. Philips is ripping money off just because of brand name,3
"First of thanks to AMAZON to deliver in lockdown situation n in such a good conditionüëçüëç

Philips surprised me with the punchy bass, loud n crystal clear sound
I like this system because of the all type of connectivity it provides.",5
"Sound quality is good with plenty of bass. However not as loud as I wanted for small parties at home or in open.

Update after 4 months of usage:
I was wrong to say speakers are not loud. I used it outdoors in a party of around 50 people and i never felt speakers are not loud.",5
"i bought for Rs 4039, it has good bass 6000 pmpo",4
"Design and looks deserve appreciation‚Ä¶ audio quality is fine, loud enough but lacks balance between bass and treble‚Ä¶ default settings has a clear vocal and bass but unfortunately you CANT ADJUST TREBLE‚Ä¶ and treble is suppressed a lot probably to highlight the vocals‚Ä¶ hence the songs lacks sweetness‚Ä¶hope users of these speakers also have experienced the same‚Ä¶the much popular ""V"" shaped custom equaliser profile gives a buzzing sound of bass. FM clarity is praiseworthy‚Ä¶ the grills of convertible speakers are delicate enough to catch dents easily‚Ä¶",4
"The Speakers only look impressive but perform very average.
Only good thing about these speakers is their Bass but it overpowers all other tones and end up sounding like any roadside boom-boom system!
Remote stopped performing after 2-3 months of usage.
Bluetooth: Felt like its generation 1 of blue-tooth connectivity feature, keeps disconnecting every now & then
I ended up using it as a FM player alone but it disappointed me here too... the FM station either changes on its own or simply disconnects itself!
In summary: Don't fall for the brand name Philips , it performs really bad!",3
"Philips is a very big company but local retailers are destroying company name.
I found today Philips MMS2220B 2.1 convertible multimedia soundbar/speaker's
But it is not starting. No power coming.
I have lodge a replacement order.",1
"Received the product before time without any damages. The sound quality is really great, the bass is super good at 6,199/-.

Edited on 16 March 21: The seller returned me 200 bucks as it got cheaper during the sale after my purchase, thanks to Aperio Retail. unfortunately, the USB port was faulty, upon complaining, Philips customer care resolved the issue by replacing the chipset with a new one within 2 days. Thanks for such a good service.

**Please stop blaming the brand or sellers if you all can't handle your stuff properly.",5
"Good product. Heavy bass.
You'll not notice Bluetooth connected.
USB will start from first song always
Humming noise from speaker when you just keep it on.. and not playing..",3
"The sound quality is crystal clear. The Philips 6080b sound system offers more than I paid for it. I was undecided among Panasonic SC HT30GW-K, Infinity Hardrock 210, and Philips 6080b. As I have already owned Phillips, Infinity (speakers), and Panasonic sound systems in the past, I knew that none of them will disappoint me. However the Infinity 210 got eliminated in my research as it offered the least features than the other two and had very inconsistent customer reviews. I preferred the Panasonic HT30GW as it offers a very unique simple design and more power (80watts), but unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt have the Bass control. One thing I observed in the customer reviews of the Philips 6089b that many customers mentioned the experience of ‚Äúcrystal clear‚Äù sound produced by it in this price range which turned out to be true. Of course it will be very unfair to compare it to the more expensive sound systems.

The design of this unit turned out to be really nice. It is very shiny but not in a cheap way. Its shine hides the physical controls on the system, making them stealth and cool.

It also remembers the sound volume and bass control setting number if you switch it off. The remote it comes with it is cheap and just okay, but I really don‚Äôt need it much. One more important thing, in the case you lose your remote or damage it, you can still turn the system on/off with the physical play button on the system itself by holding it for 2-3 seconds. Only thing I haven‚Äôt figured out is how to control the base setting if the remote gets damaged as there is no base knob on the system, perhaps a universal remote can work.

Tips - Read the user manual which comes with it for the proper placement of the 2.1 sound system. I also bought a small voltage stabilizer to use with it from my local shop because in my area voltage fluctuates a lot in summer. A voltage stabilizer can protect it from getting short circuited and also helps to maintain the sound volumes consistent. Make sure to adjust the volume of your phone/tablet/laptop if you listen the audio with the Bluetooth of your device otherwise you might think the Philips 6080b isn‚Äôt loud enough.",5
"This is a good 2.1 multi media speaker.
Pro:
1. Bass effect is very good.
2. It's very loud.
3. Vocal clarity is good.
4. Bluetooth works great.
5. Remot control works fine but philips could have given the treble control too. It irritates you a lot which I have mentioned in cons section.
Cons:
1. Wire length is very short. If you place the speakers close to woofer with wire length provided, you won't get the stereo effect.
2. Woofer effect is very high compared to speakers which degrades the listening quality . It gives you headache if you listen for a long time.
3. Treble is a headache here. It sometimes works excessively . This is the the main cons for me.

Over all this is for those persons who like loudness and high treble. It is a good product with good clarity. I gave it 3 star because of excessive woofer effect and treble effect which spoils my listening experience otherwise I would have rated it 5 .
I hope philips will fix these problems with upcoming models. Please Philips fix these problems . Still you have a lot of loyal customers in India.
I hope this helps .",4
"Did not expect such quality. Amazing. Very Recommended.

In Some reviews, People were saying Display was necessary to see if volume high or low etc. For me i this it is not required just because, whenever you pres any key on remote, the LED light on the woofer blinks if it is changing. In other words, if you keep on pressing volume button low, it will blink till the volume drops to the lowest level and after that it stops blinking. Same goes with Bass as well.

Quality is superb and voice is clean.",5
"This is an amazing speaker system. It has a lot of options, starting from USB, SD Card, AUX, CD and Bluetooth so that you can play music from your smartphone or laptop or connect it to your TV system while watching a movie.

Sound is so crisp, no jarring effect.",5
"PROS
- Good or worth Sound Quality which wont dissapoint you
- Good Bass with Bass controller and without much distortion at top levels
- Avg Sound Clarity which is worth this price
- Good Looking
- Subwoofer build quality is good with nice design

CONS
- A low humming sound just when idle even when nothing is playing
- Speaker build quality is not upto the expectations and stand provided is not much stable. Using as a sound bar is much more better.
- Though speakera have lengths and seems to have 2 drivers, it actually have single driver and rest is empty space. Just lengthy speakers for looks only

Overall product is good at this range and much better than some alternatives",4
"In this price, this is a beautiful deal. I bought it for Rs.6499 on 12th Jan 2021 and got it delivered today.

Forget all those speakers which claim to give you an output of more than 40RMS ... they all have distorted bass. My written words cannot describe the beauty of those speakers. Epic sound quality (high rich audio that your windows will crack), rich bass that is not for the faint hearted (controllable), crystal clear output, amazing source compatibility and awesome bluetooth range of 10 meters ... just a dream come true in this price.

I just love this system and you would too when it comes to you and you have to see it to believe it!!!",5
Average product.... poor quality package.... product has got damages on the way... bluetooth connectivity stopped working within 2 months.. Remote poor quality which is no more alive in 4 months,1
Excellent product this is so fantastic product.,5
"After my beloved philips fw-335 died due mains fluctuation, i wanted to buy a musical sounding system.After researching found out that todays speaker systems are not upto the mark or sound as balanced as older systems made during 1990s or early 2000.my predictions were that philips would still have maintained their signature sound to some extent.And i was not wrong,after listening to the system i felt as follows:(i am being very strict and comparing it to my reference system philips fw-335 which had a high end sound with high end price tag back then).
Pros:
-bass is really good/musical.i.e. you can divide bass into two section i.e low end and upper bass (100hz).This system manages both in a balanced manner i.e. in order to enjoy music your 100hz should be well boosted.bass notes are well defined i.e lower and upper bass are well separated.
-midrange and high frequencies are good.If you compare with competition its better.But if you compare it to my reference fw-335 system it lacks the soundstage,depth or 3d holographic effect potrayed by fw-335.
-i think no other manufacturer can tune sound the way philips has done even from chinese ics and passive components.chinese components cannot match brands like elna,rubycon,jrc,toshiba,matsushita,philips's own ics and passive components(carbon film resistors and mkt capacitors),wolfson,mitsubishi,sanyo,panasonic.
-after listening to the bass performance,i was instantly reminded of jrc 4558,guess what i opened the system out of curiosity and voila! i found two jrc 4558 in preamp.(the reason for good bass.)
cons:
cons are not in comparison to the competition,but in comparison to my reference fw-335.
mid intruments such as snare drums should have more space.mid bass should be improved(lack of mid bass is a common disadvantage of 3 inch full range drivers).
conclusion:
The conclusion para consists of my experience about today's bad phase in audio electronics.with ban on chinese electronics,and make in india initiative,its time philips starts manufacturing its speaker drivers from past i.e the legendary hi-q international full range drivers,balanced frequency responce woofer/mid bass drivers that they used in power house system,aw series and early fw series.I request philips to bring back their legendary signature sound from 1990's.i think with todays automation and lower labour cost its possible to bring back the old signature sound of philips even at 3x or 4x the cost of this system.we would still pay 3x ,4x more price than todays systems just for the balanced musical sound that the philips music systems had during 1990's.This is definitely achievable if philips takes our feedback seriously.If philips does this they can blow the competitors out of competition.",5
"Writing this review after usage of 10 months. Sound wise its good. The problem arose with the speaker ports for AUX i.e. to take input from other devices like Mobile, TV etc. In my case, it is LED TV and it was working Okay for 10 months but a huge disturbing noise started coming now which I tried resolving by replacing the AUX wire but no luck. Although the product comes under warranty but no idea how Philips post buying experience would be.",2
"The sound is good, so is the look and the performance. Was just curious to know who puts the subwoofer at the bottom of the speaker? I mean who is the designer? Also it has facility to hang the 2 tower speakers on the wall but the main speaker cannot be hanged.... I mean seriously..",4
"This is best in sound at this price. Only disappointment is, controlling bass option is only in remote. It should have also provided on woofer. What if remote is gone bad?
Apart from this, its a very good product. Dont go for other -ve reviews about sound etc., Just go for it.",4
"You pay only for the brand. The output is not upto the mark. I was using creative sbs. So i feel a bit let down on the quality of audio. It is also not loud enough. Bluetooth remembers only one connected device. You have to pair everytime you connect it to a diff device. After connecting to another device, you have to pair once again to connect to previous device. FM radio receiver is not good. Even with antenna there is noise in reception.",2
"Fake description about product in Amazon about size of sound box and power output of subwoofer. Sound is not up to the expectations from Philips, reliance reconnect sound system is much better stability at Max sound rather than philips at Same price segment. I purchased this item after seeing several reviews, so I must that a person giving their reviews must have some knowledge to identify real sounds and actual outputs of sound boxes. There is diffence in booming sound and loudness, this product is for loudness not for booming.sound is limited to room only not outside of room.",3
"1. It is a good product.
2. Heavy Bass.
3. It is not a premium product.
4. However for the cost, it is good.
5. Bluetoooth connectivity is nice.
6. The speakers need a grill to avoid physical damage.
7. Nice design.",4
"Sound is superb and crisp. Bass is terrible and adjustable. Was very happy, since i could easily connect my Smart TV with this MMS6080B, through bluetooth and was thrilling to watch English movies with great sound. Could connect and pair all the devices very fast. Can listen to FM, songs from the mobile, attach USB and so on. Very good for music lovers that too at a lower price.",5
"Negative: I have purchased and returned this product for not working one of the speakers, so I got replacement for it. After replacement also I got the defect product (plugin bent)
Positive: Sound and bass are good",2
"I have been using this system for around 2 weeks now.
Delivered in good condition and on time as promised, but unit seems to be old ..of July 2019.
Sound Quality is good, satisfactory performance in this price range. No Eqillizer options available in BT/ Aux mode. Not a big problem default settings works fine with songs/ Movies/ games etc..well we can control bass in any mode.
Build quality is also good, even satellites have wooden body with nice fit n finish, however I personally did not like glossy finish on the front panels. I would prefer matt black finish..well it's subjective matter anyways.
On other hand Remote seems to be of cheap quality and doesn't even work effectively.
Batteries are not provided in the box.by Philips*
Other disappointing thing I felt is.. wire length for satellite, too short to set up properly.
Bluetooth/ Aux connectivity is good no issues at all.
Overall it's good value for money product, you may certainly consider this.
Thanks !",4
"Not happy with the product. I returned it because there was a constant hum from the subwoofer when there is was no input sound. For instance if you are listening to a playlist and here is a moments silence between songs you can hear the hum. Or if you pause play, then too you will hear it. It disappears at 0 volume, but comes back at the first increment in volume. When I noticed it the first time, it thought it was a defective piece and got it replaced. But the replaced piece also had the same issue, so got a refund. Full marks to Amazon for doing it promptly. Other customers have commented on the same issue, but I didn‚Äôt really read all the reviews before deciding to buy it. If I had, I wouldn‚Äôt have bought it. Lesson learnt....always read customer reviews before deciding to buy. Philips should seriously look into this issue and fix it as it‚Äôs damaging to their good name. Now I will be hesitant to buy a Philips audio product in future unless I am sure I could get a full refund if not satisfied.",2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I ordered this for my friend's wedding. 9 people contributed and bought it and all were watching when my friend unboxed it, but it became a very embarrassing moment when the woofer did not power on. We tried to switch it in different plugs but the power on Led did not blink. I have 6080b model and 9120b tower speakers in my home buy this was extremely dissappointing and this did not happen with those. Khair....the customer care got it replaced and the second one worked just fine. The FM reception is very low for a speaker of this size and cost. But you would love it when connected to a Led tv or via bluetooth. I have given one star less due to Appario's carelessness.",4
Seems the retailer is fraud as he has given some refurbished product in which the remote does not work. All the stickers was removed and hand prints and dust on the woofers and speakers. Worst packing which can lead to product damage. Amazon should black list these kind of retailers which brings down Amazon brand value. One of the speakers also have some noise while playing song.,1
"Though it works well, The sound quality I am not fully ok. I bought for less boss and very milk sound but here every time you need to adjust the boss to have quality sound. Overall OK product.
it is not working properly now. spurious product. suddenly while listening music it is getting silenced. IN any mode, auxiliary, blue tooth, fm, or usb. Pl tell me what to do? is it replacement possible or what to do please answer. It is china made philips product which is spurious. if you happened to read this please tell me or call me 9940153667 wit solution if possible. But here afterwards please tell us if it is chinese product we will avoid buying it through amazon. I feel my money got wasted if I would have bought in show room I would have checked and bought where it is manufactured. PL HELP",1
"No Doubt, Philips product is really good. But if i have to say about the Packing of the product, its Pathetic. I received the Product with one leg broken for the sub woofer. I tried for replacement, but the seller does not have a stock currently. Thus, only option is to take a refund, as Amazon only replace the product if the same seller has the stock available. They cannot replace from a different seller. This is a catch and a learning for me as a loyal customer, to not trust the 10 days replacement policy.
Recommendations will be, buy the product form a offline store as the product is good and a good experience with 2.1 Channel speakers but do not trust the packaging of the online shopping websites.",4
Suddenly stop working after 1-2 hrs of playback..it happens 2 time.... I wish I can buy 1 more time bcoz of sound is awesome...bass is very hard...but I don't bcoz if the product fails 2 times in 1-2 hrs. Of playback than what should happen after return window close ..we need to rush on Phillips customer care...,1
Product is worthless. Sound quality is zero. It's loud than clear. Can only enjoy in case want volume up to 25 percent after that woffer start shaking and voice looks to be fake and suppressed. Waste of money,1
If you wann buy mini DJ for your house and is your hall is big . Just close your eye and buy this product I have used around 10 sound system till now but this one is one of best. I have ever used and that undar 6500 rs and please make sure this is best for house not for Open place like shop or something like that and also if you gonna use it like every day around 5 to 6 hours it might give you little bit low sound but your family guy and buying for morning artis and weekend movies and party's at house just go for it 100% this product is perfect for it I am using this product from last 1year and friend of mine who suggested me to buy this product he is using it from 3 years. And this is true from my side .,4
"Good product by philips , sound quality is also good, bass is really ground shaking..
But produces some humming sound if the bass is increased on Bluetooth connectivity..

But recommend you to not purchase from the seller Appario.. as it provides me damaged product 2 times after then I got the right product..

Overall best product by Philips.. worth price and design is also good.",5
"Superb in sound & built quality nice, but only problem with USB, its sudden getting stopped after 3-4 songs, v have to re-start for smooth play by doing power on off, Bluetooth working superbly, exterior body excellent. & Over all Amazon maintained excellent package quality n in time delivery.",3
"Writing it on my 2nd of purchasing it. Sound quality is awesome gives real feel,, I can't play it on full volume in my 2 bhk flat as neighbour can't hear their TV volume then.
I received the product with little damage, 1 long scratch on 1 sound bar and 1 minor dent on second sound bar. But I was expecting it because I had gone through the reviews so it was not a big disappointment for me. 1 brownie point for me is that fm was working awesome as most ppl said in review that fm doesn't work properly but it's awesome in my case .
I feel that the size of subwoofer and bar is unnecessary big. when I first time holded it in my hand it left paint mark on my hand and considering dent I would say that build quality is not that good. I bought it for 7k and am satisfied.",4
"Its a nice speaker system but do not have high expectation. At this price range you will get more options. I heard low end Philips multimedia speakers and the quality/loudness of the speaker was awesome. So that was the reason i was expecting much more at this price range. For 15x15 room its sufficient.

P.S. : Radio is worthless. No signal in-fact after setting proper antenna wire.",3
I bought this product on Jan 3rd. The sound was amazing. But last week suddenly it stopped working and smoke came from inside the sub woofer system and the whole board have been burned out. I registered it in Philips service centre and they called me within 6 hours and they told to bring it to the near by town which is situated nearly about 40 kms. They tested and told that whole board has been burned out it will take one week to service the system. We have the doubt that the product is original or not.,1
I bought this product a month ago from Amazon . while you continous listen music for one hour it won't works.only woofer works and speaker will not work.,2
"Sound quality is ok(No mains distortion),
Uses a 5bit gain control,
Bluetooth connectivity is better than other brands,
FM needs an antenna extension,
Sleep power is less,
If using Aux input, use better jack than provided.
There is no earthing lead for this system(would have appreciated more).
Inbuilt preconfigured equalizer is helpful when listening to lectures vs music vs movie(manual equalizer tuning would have been nice for advanced users).
No batteries are provided for the remote from factory.",5
"Great product, 1st received with one left speaker not working but got replaced in 2 days time with great Amazon service... 2nd received with bad package quality but product completely fine and as shown and mentioned!! Sound quality good once tuned as per the output source requirement and plays well... would had been better with HDMI connection ... but really a value for money product...",4
Love the product. Great sound. Quite loud. The bass effect is superb. Price quite reasonable.,5
"Only disappointing thing is no brace/net cover/ rat protection for bass. It is located below the woofer cabinet pointing ground. Phillips can add a small screen on woofer for some basic info.
Bass and music outcome is great. A very good music system for a room.",3
"Bad quality product
Amazon also a bad seller
They doesnt exchange this product which have no quality of sound..
They think we select there product through an image.. which is note possible",1
"Extremely poor built quality. Material used are extremely cheap. Down facing bass speakers are susceptible to damage as it is without any protective cover. satellite speaker is extremely small and does not have sufficient punch.
Philips would loose its reputation by selling cheap re branded Chinese products",1
"When I purchased them, I was quite confused that how will they perform when they'll meet my desires. Then the order arrived and as I opened them I just wonder to it's material quality that I'll become a fan of it. And after that when it comes to fulfill my desires, I swear it fulfills it and give me alot enjoyment whenever I play them. I feel wonder whenever I play them. Thanks to Phillips.",5
"Arrived on time with proper packaging and in a spic and span condition. All functions are working satisfactorily.

Good sound quality with good bass. However, music lovers would miss mids and treble control. Also, cables for satellite speakers are very short.

All in all its an excellent purchase at this price range. I would recommend this product to all those who need a branded but a budget 2.1 home theater system.",5
Great product but I got a defective piece. I started hearing s loud buzzing sound when I switched it on after 3-4 months. I took it to the svx CTR at himayatnagar and they said nothing was wrong. The sound stopped for 2 months and started again intermittently. Most recently I got a burning smell when using it and switched it off. It hasn't worked at all since. I would not suggest this product even though I like Philips.,3
Nice,5
"I have received the product on time but it makes me surprise after using it. I have connected through the Bluetooth and played songs, the out put the subwoofer really makes me feel lime some local quality. The subwoofer bas is constant and through the unbearable bass sound not on the smoother way. I think this product not belongs to Philips, Believing Amazon we order products but the seller sell the local made product by the name of brand. Please stop making fool to the customers.",1
"I have recived a damaged product.
it was already opened one.
the sound was not coming.
and I got a replacement for the same.
it is working good.
good build quality. good soundnight and bass.
FM also working good.
remote control is also good.
more options to connect.
just value for the money.
dont thinkforget, jst buy.!",5
"I have researched for more than 3 months while buying Philips MMS8085B. I purchased this in 6200 bucks and believe this is one of the best speakers in this range. I also checked the Boat soundbars which are in this range, but Philips has a edge over all those soundbars and speakers. At first it comes with classy look that attracts anybody attention towards it. Second the Sound quality is awesome. I have connected it with my TV using bluetooth and it performs awesome. Base quality is also very good. You can change the base as per your requirement. However the remote buildup quality is very poor.",5
Received damaged one sound baar very disappointed .. and box is also break,1
"Remote lacks feedback,
Speakers Bluetooth is fine but EQ is really bad,
Unnecessary base going out, barely any quality in sound, design is OK, as advertised its is completely opposite of it, didn't expected for a 60rms power speaker that too from Philips,
Sound is distorted not good after 15 volume out of 30, don't buy it, I am sending it for return.",2
"The sound quality of provided Satellite speakers is not good. Bass unit is decent.
I have old Panasonic bookshelf speakers which I hooked up instead of Philips satellite speakers.
Now the sound quality is simply Superb.
Philips needs to give better quality Satellite speakers.
Otherwise a pretty decent system.",4
"Excellent 1 day delivery via normal check out. The sound quality can only be ""listen it to believe it"". Awesome product for the price. Connects to bluetooth device in seconds, FM works like magic, USB mode is very good as you get to play around with the equalizer present in the remote. All in all a great product at such price.",5
Stopped working suddenly after 2-3 days moreover one of the speaker were damaged ( crack in the plastic body),1
"It became not operative After six days working.It might be into power ckt fault.it maybe due to defective piece or detail route cause analysis is required at manufacturing end for avoid the repeatiation at any customer.
By luck it was under return time limit.hence I go for replacement on the name of PHILIPS because for good quality.Unfortuantely my piece became defective after five days of working",5
Its just Ok. The remote is not having treble control and only Bass control. If the bass is increased the speaker flutters . The sharpness in sound is less and can not be increased.,4
"The system does more than justice for the price. Overall, a fantastic buy- Gr88 product from Philips. The sub woofer is extremely powerful even though rms is only 60W. Speakers provide crystal clear sound at all volume levels. When i tried to play in excess of 20 level of volume my entire PC table, sliding windows & even iron grills started to vibrate. Tremendous power in such a small system. Overall an excellent buy.",5
"Bass is completely waste. You will not hear the beats with this speaker. Just the bass guitar's sound alone will come from the amplifier. No drum beats or the thabala bass will be heared. Overall rating is 3. Go for some other brands in this price range. Even the intex 2.1 small speakers gives a great sound compared to this speaker. In addition to that, you will hear a constant buzzing sound.....",2
"Philips 6080b blue tooth home theatre system,a fantastic gadget to play music through mobile phone, USB, FM radio, memory card. Very nice sound with sufficient bass(controlled by remote) and I am using it with my LED TV. Beautiful sound quality, good remote control and a vfm product, highly recommend.I bought it in BBD with huge discount.",5
"Received a dead item. Doesn't turn on, no blinking lights or nothing. Besides the speakers look really cheap and there is no 3.5 Input for the convertible satellite speakers. Absolutely pathetic product and service. J would have returned anyway.",1
"I bought these with a hesitated mind about the quality of sound it would produce, but to my surprise the speakers didn't disappoint me. They have a great balance of sound even on higher / lower notes, doesn't vibrate and the crystal clear sound is heard. Very much suitable for in-house parties. Connects to Bluetooth efficiently and a very handy remote to control specially the base separately. Can be recommended.",5
"Packing of the product is very poor.
Don't buy this product. I m not happy with philips brand.

Waste of money.",1
Beautiful home thyater. Both bass and treble are good. Looking is also beautiful.Unbeatable sound quality.,5
"One side speaker was not worked, So i returned the product",2
"sound is superb , woofer satisfies the beats ,amazon delivered the product on time as Usual . I am so happy with this deal only u will miss the display it helps too much while listening means u don‚Äôt understand the volume level and bass level and also the right speaker bar got a little dent which is easily been see if u see it closely otherwise it worth Buying. My request to amazon please increase your package quality so that the product will delivere Safely",5
Superb performance,5
"Very good product under 3000 rupees. Bass is good. A bit problematic while connecting with bluetooth, else everything is fine. Early delivery by Amazon. Philips is always trustworthy for me. Received with no damage. Go for it if you need a sound system for your room in low budget.",5
"I love the sound quality and it's overall performance is better then I expected..but what I don't like that is.. First, I received the defective product with sound defect. There were no sound at all. Then I got the replaced one which has special design on the sound bar check the pic. Overall delivery process took approx 10 days. Which wasn't expected. I was planning to buy appliances here but drroped that idea. I don't know whose to be blaimed the Facility or the relailer or the courier. That sucks.",4
1st product came defected. Exchange was carried out by Amazon very fast. 2nd product gave up in 20 days..it's completely dead now. I guess Amazon is selling refurbished product in name of new product. Guys please be careful at discount rates offered by Amazon. They distribute defected product in sales and later on you face problem.,1
After purchasing this I thout better if I go with boat 120w system .. above of this is volume controller not cd case .. over all this product also ok ok,3
"I bought the speaker and return it next day my smart TV doesn't have old line in connectivity option.
The speaker has lack of connectivity option Phillips should consider to provide atleast optical out all the smart TV equipped with the hdmi and optical out.
The groove of the speaker dominate the quality of the sound if your bedroom and living room big in size then only you should consider else you won't enjoy the music.",3
"Sound quality , Build quality, and the connectivities are really good. But remote control won't work if I am trying to control in different direction. FM also little lacking (but that's the common issue for these type of speaker system)

Regarding the delivery - it was fast, but one side of the package got completely wet due to rain. So I must say packing is not up to the mark.",5
"the sound quality was average.
the product stopped working after a few days (3-4 days). it does not power up anymore. asked for replacement as it is still under replacement window.

Praying that the replaced system should not end up in the same state.",1
"Received a damaged product.
This model is perfect but unfortunately i received a defective item.",1
Sound quality is very good...but received in damaged condition...,4
"I don't know what to say about these speakers
I thought my tv speakers will give me better sound but this is the best pair of speakers. Use this for watching tv shows and movies. Amazing clarity with clear and detailed sound. Buy thing",5
"Sound quality is very good, you can increase decrease Bass. But the bluetooth keeps on disconnecting. One of the speaker also does not work at times, so I have to restart the speakers to connect bluetooth and make all speakers work. Not raising a complain because of Corona, but expected better quality from Phillips.",2
Bought in July 2018 and now in Sept 19 it has got issues. Initially its hard keys stopped responding properly. Now System has stopped working. It is just out of warrantee. Dont know what to do,1
sound quality is good and Bluetooth get connected fast. Writing review after 1 week. But can't control treble except volume and bass. Overall nice sound and in this budget very nice music system.,5
Actually I have already one Philips home theater in my house which I had purchased 3yrs back costing around 15000‚Çπ but recently purchased this pdt for gift to my Dad which is very nice pdt.good quality sound basically his bass which is Awesome .I am very much thanks to Amazon who kept this quality PDT for sale.thanks,5
Durability of product. I am using it from last 2 years and now started facing the problem as one of its speaker input socket is not working. I think its too early to have such problems from such a renowned brand. Sound quality is ok not superb. But in 5k we expect nore than this.,3
Main speaker box speaker was not safe position any damage was come some time no guard was provided. Not like this .,2
I was shocked when i heard them. They sound like roadside Chinese boombox with nothing but bass in them. If you are really low on budget then get F&D (fenda) but if your budget is anything above 5k then just do yourself a favor and get EDIFIER. Any edifier bookshelf speakers in your budget- (they have a huge range). thank me later!!,1
"The speaker is good but when it was delivered the product was some damaged . Then I call the boy who delivered the speaker then he told me No refund by cash. Only through bank account and. Amazon pay ! If any
one Don't have bank account or Amazon. Pay How they will get refund?............................................this is the question to Amazon",5
"Excellent and decent sound quality, especially for a home with NORMAL bass and sound, And not for Rock and heavy. Thank Philips and one more thank to the Amazon, Vendor.",4
"Woofer box is very large and shape is also odd, thia make it difficult to fit in a corner and lookas odd one out.
Soumd is ok not what you expect.
This is made in china to plastic quality is also not so good.",3
"Actually, product is really good, of course.. Philips is awesome brand. But the delivery was so Unexpectable. Remote control, warranty card bill was missing... I received unpacked box... I really disappointed... Pls Amazon make sure that the delivery service must be good.",3
Not even worth for single star also first I received a detective product after running for 10 mins it has stopped working again the replacement I have got is a damaged one the leg of subwoofer was broken and dents in the subwoofer,1
"Reviewing after almost 1 year of use it is very nice speaker for birthday parties, anniversary parties, new year's party at home or terrace. Very nice product must buy.",5
Bass control not given in remote. Treble is very high even if you put it at very lower level. Sound quality is good but kot up to the expectations. Go for Sony instead if you can spend 2000 more.,2
Received a damaged product. One of the lower edges is smashed slightly and I had not noticed it. Bass is not working. Unfortunately I had gifted the product and the defrcts were noticed aftef the return window was closed.,3
"Thanks to amazon for delivering within 24 hours..and coming to product it has reached my expectations in all aspects i would recommend to go for this one without second thought i got it at 5800 rs in offer.CONs are
No LED display to track song name ..and missing automated Bass and sound adjustments..",5
Bass is amazing . No issues with Bluetooth connectivity . It's so loud even in 20 percent volume . Great for parties and you would love to use it somewhere not surrounded by irritating neighbours.,5
"Great sound bluetooth and works perfectly with my home theater system the sound quality is good and output is also loud and with woofer you get one subwoofer at the bottom of the main tower that delivers great cinematic experience rich bass
Absolutely loved this product",5
Dissatisfied with sound output,1
"It's amazing speakers. Can use as a bar as well as towers like a monolithic dropped at your home.
But after 6 months, the sound is not that good, lot of not needed bass noise, no clue on warranty or if I can get it replaced since it's in warranty still.
Amazon please help if you reading this and if the customer reviews matter for you!
#hopingHelp",3
"I have used this in my Bedroom and it's been amazing. Excellent Bass and clear sound. You may find it difficult to adjust the bass and balance initially but as you keep using it you will find the right balance. Point to not is that it does not sync well with some of the players on your mobile when you connect through Bluetooth, I had issues with Poweramp and when I used another player it worked pretty well.",5
"Giving three star because woofer is very small , and wrong information shared by the seller about weight as actual weight is 5.1 Kg I stead on 8.9 kg , overall sound quality is good and you can buy this device.",3
"Bass quality is awesome but the sub speaker's clarity sucks at mid tone, it is not up to the mark, not so sharp and powerful sound.

This 2.1 is not for rock or metal music but you can enjoy melody or soft music very well.

Price is little bit high than performance.",3
"Its average. Not up to the mark like it's name.
Sometimes bluetooth and FM not working, I mean Bluetooth and FM is below average.
Sound is like, ppl of 80's would like it.
Not for youth.
In this budget any local brand would be better than this.",2
"I bought it from Amazon and it was delivered on time. The product is worth it's price. However, a clear and descriptive booklet for guding on how to save radio channels should have been provided with the product.",5
"Servicing and responseto the customers at philips service centers is tooworst. Don't purchase philips products. We have loggedthe complaint before warranty period and service centre kept with them without repairing two months and finally tellingthe warranty has expired. No proper response and respect to the customers fromtheirseniors also.

So don't purchase philips items",1
Sound clarity is very good. Awesome for music as well as movies. I am no audiophile but I feel that bass is just right in this system.,5
"I am very very happy
Sound quality super
Sheerness super
Value for money",5
"Product is good. It is Philips, that name itself satisfy us. Since 15 years I have a Philips Music system, 3VCD changer, bought before DVD invention, which is now giving problems, hence I purchased again Philips product.
Seller: I am very much impressed by seller Appario. Sent the product in good packing. Before said time delivery.",5
"productis ok , good sound performance, but sub speaker cabel is too short..Though using at distance for sub speaker is not possible . And one sub speaker is producing ssssss noise, F&D brand is good",2
I am disappointed because this is my first order from amazon & the left speaker is dead.Sound quality is okay.The replacement TAT is again 4 days which sounds miserable.I think flipcart is a better option since I haven't received any faulty products as of now.,3
"Overall its a good experience.

But the 3mm jack that was connected to our LED TV, creates background noise. Jack connectivity is of bad quality.

Other connectivity like Bluetooth and USB works as expected.",3

Good one for living room. Bass and other equaliser setting need to improve. Bluetooth works nicely. FM RADIO woks good even low signle intensity. Power cabel is too short. Auto search for FM radio button should be different on remote control.,3
"Good Bass Quality,
but the wires for speakers are small.. Product should have had volume control and bass control button on the woofer itself hence i gave 4 starts for this product.
Received it today only from Amazon...
Thanks for fast delievery prime amazon..Nice service from Amazon...üòä
Anyways product is nice.",4
"nothing special about voice, pretty much average sound quality, only thing is its bass deepness when put volume somewhere around 15 and bass adjusted at 10 or more, one think i am sure that sound of bass from woofer will not break on high note",4
Phillips must seriously consider updagrading its products with optical output & HDMI connectivity for clarity of sound. Remote control not upto the mark but acceptable as it is working fine. Bluetooth connectivity is excellent. Sound quality is soothing & lovly. Overall extremely happy with the product. Dont think twice coz it is a much better than Sony in the same range.,5
Its decent for the price. Bass is too high.,4
"SOUND - CLEAR AND LOUD
BUFFER IS NOT SHAKING ON FULL VALOUME ,,WHICH IS GOOD

Good quality of sound,5
Product is fine for the cost spent. But package and delivery is bad experience. Package has been covered with transparent and tape. Cart box is broken it reveals that delivery is not handled properly.,3
A quality product from Philips. Excellent sound and bass. The build quality is worth mentioning. It served my purpose.,5
"excellent sound for a mid size room.. also connectivity is easy, Bluetooth also worked flawlessly, 10 seconds to connect.

The product started malfunctioning after 1.5 years. And after 1 year 10 months the box gave up. The diaphragm is damaged now and I have no clue what to do with it now. Bad experience with Philips. üôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅüôÅ,2

I request you to return my money as soon as possible. Thank you.",3
"I have a received defective item, as it power on and after few seconds it gets automatically off.....and I have requested for a replacement of this product...Now I think it will be new and working condition..",1
Products sound quality is good but the length of the side speakers too short had to buy a extension cable.,5
Sound quality is good but Aux cable was damaged . As I needed it in that particular day I didn't returned it and as I used so it was not right to return. Overall very good sound quality but still I needed to purchase aux cable seperately.,4
It is not working and supplied used item which was rejected by someone. original packing and labels are tampered. replacement request raised. expecting at least this they will supply brand new product (not unpacked/rejected item).,1
"Speaker has a great low end bass which can make u sleep . Richer sound quality. Great package to buy . Overall good .
But once you start increasing the volume speaker and bass gets worse. Not good for big area.
I suggest take a close look at your area .
But one of the speaker is little bit bent.",5
The sound quality is amazing. And now after 3 months its is subwoofer stopped working. I used it daily for 1 hour at 10% volume. suddenly it turned off and now it is not turning on. According to me don't buy it. Go for something more branded.,1

No brainer .Go ahead and buy it",5
Had to change my review because full system stopped working after 3-4 uses. Sad and disappointed.,1
"Yes, This product is good and compitative in resonable price segment. Sound quality and build quality is good. Bass beyond 18 producing quite vibration. Overall it's a good product.",4
I am reviewing after 1 week.. Sound quality is super.. Bass is more high than i expected.. Remote control is awesome.. Totally this product is amazing.. They delivered in date.. Only one disadvantage there is no display thats why i gave 4 stars.. Except that i would like to give 5 stars,4
"Output is really amazing. It has option to control the amount of bass you want to listen to. Radio reception is also good. Bluetooth is fast to connect but range is normal 10-15 feet.
Only thing lacking is the display for volume. That would have made this product a complete 5 star.",4
"+ve
Sound quality, build and material quality, sturdy, looks good in the drawing room.

Remote control is way below grade in both, looks as well as operation. Bluetooth connectivity loss happens at times. For FM, there is no way to know which channel is playing, no display, could be improved.",4
Good speaker on this price..little big..but still its fine..remote looks very cheap quality..soudn quality is fine..Bass is so much..,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Awesome sound clarity n good Bluetooth connectivity",4
"It's awesome for this price range
It's loud enough but it lacks the bass and treble button so it's like automatic. They are according to your song selection.
U can't set them or increase them.
A setback for bass lovers",5
"Sound quality is nice. Bluetooth auto connectivity I like ok..
I think produst is nice in this price range . Good for music lover. Go for it",4
I'd suggest you go for something else. Price doesn't justify the features. I bought it thinking philips is a good company. One of the speakers distort at high pitch and there is no way to control the subwoofer. The eq presets are bad.,3
"Overall its good..bass is awesome..but there is a small dent in d woofer..may b it was returned earlier by someone else.. anyway, product is satisfactory..",4
"No Bass/Treble adjust button, sound quality is okay as per the price range.",2
"If u r thinking Philips is brand and it has no problem then its your blunder mistake .

remote response is slow even after changing the batteries,4
"Not worth of 7000, sound quality is like neutral but base was not as expected after paying this much amount, i have my last sounds system which is to far better then this in 4000.

Ya one plus pnt if you want to show off just go for this design n finishing is awesome.",3
Great product. Brilliant Bass. Speciality is seperate bass adjustment. Sound doesn't hurts at full volume. Crystal clear audio. Good bass and treble combination. Must buy.,5
Orsm..just orsm..nice clear sound..nice bass...over all orsm..just a small problem .that have no display... otherwise its orsm,5
"The sound output was ok but the unit started malfunctioning within 10 days of buying, the bass effect has completely gone off. Before going off, the bass was unstable for some moment.",3
"Am bought it me and friend also.good quality and design, material.but bass level average.",4
"""Good"" in every aspect. Some brands offers more sound and compactness but this built quality is too good. It's lack of looks but does its job.",4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Superb base and high quality sound...
I'm totally impressed....
It's an excellent product really...
If u want to buy it don't go back just order it....
Thank you...",5
Surely go for it it helps you give very clear and loud music with 100% volume and also enables a deep bass go for it if you want the best music feels from you setup,5
"Using for past 4 years no major issues.
Best Bass in 2.1 category. Build was good but the electronic buttons are not much reliable. Sometimes it changes itself to other mode like Bluetooth or any... very rarely...
Remote quality is not upto the mark.",4
the most third class sound i have ever heard .. don't buy this product.,1
"Everything is good on this product.
Remote control good but buttons not work properly some time if don't have remote you couldn't even start the speakers.
There no manual adjustment on sound only base and volume can increase or decrease.",4
"Bass is very low, and sub-woffer capacity is very low, you won't feel the bass in the songs or movie but sound is good.
Three stars for sound.
Zero stars for bass.
If you want bass, don't buy these.
Thanks.",3
"It ais very good product with decent bass and audio quality.
Fabulous look.üòò
Good for small hall.",4
I always used to purchase Philips audio system. This one is the most poor quality audio system. I wanted to purchase higher system in lieu of this one but the seller system did n't allow for upgrade. I have wasted my money.,1
"Good quality sound. Reasonable price. Connection with tv, bluetooth devices, mobile is very good.",5
"Poor Quality with Good Design, never going to buy a Philips product again. After few weeks of usage speaker started some noise. Remote stopped working . Within 4 months it become totally unusable.
Not sure about warranty. I have to run behind that now.",1
"This is a bass machine , mainly produce bass with any source. Treble is hidden or not audible when volume is high. There is option only to increse or decrease bass not for treble.",3
The product is very good .but the service of the Philips customer care and area manager is very bad and they are very irresponsible for doing their job and specifically the behavior of the area manager is very bad for the service.,5
"Good sound quality, good remote control and value for money. Bad is its woofer size, is too high given which I think unnecessary, taking too much space. Remain good.",4
Everything is too good except usb and sd card slot at back. you can enjoy the max sound by aux cable and pen drive. Bass is so high you will feel irritated if played at more than 50% in a closed room.,5
"Using this product since 5 months and found excellent. Sound quality is very good, Bass is amazing the only lag is it's remote. The remote has to be improved.",5
"It's been more than 5 years since I ordered it and it's still working like it's new ,superb bass ,superb connectivity ,just amazing product",5
Worst channel speaker. Bass was high but it blurred the music completely. Remote control is even cheaper than some cheap plastic toy. Just went by brand name and got cheated. Don't buy this product guys.,1
"Very poor Service from philips.will never buy philips again.
Bass is more than audio output because the two 4 inch speakers are very less in front of big towering bass.no display.hummming sound is always there.dont buy unless u only want bass.",2
Remote can be little bigger than provided. Excellent product from phillips. I connected to stb for better sound quality while watching tv,5
Good Sound quality,5
If you a bass lover then it is not for you. jbl go has enough bass than it.,1
This is a complete package at this price point. All connectivity including FM are working flawlessly,5
"On time delivery, thank you Amazon.
Packaging also very good, both speaker and woofer are in good condition. Easy to assemble.
Bluetooth connectivity very good, connect on single attempt.
Sounds quality crisp and clear with deep bass.
Value for money.",5
Product is awesome with very good sound quality but it has a defective remote set given with the set. Quality control team or technical team should check & pack before selling to customer. Any ways i was very disappointed.,4
Sound quality is very good the bass is very strong bluetooth connectivity is too good convenient to use the best part is that it massive 90 watt speaker ...Build is quality is so good,5
Remote control not working...what I have to do...shall I return only remote or complete system...pls advice...,4
"Dear sir/madam
My problem is one speaker is not working
I'm giving complaint but philips care not listening and my complaint is not rising still now I am using only one speaker please your side any help",5
"Great option for the price! Don't expect thumpy bass like f&d, bass is richer, and audio quality is much better. Satellite speaker wires are a bit short, might have to buy male-female Rca extension. Bluetooth functions and the remote are working perfectly for the time being.",5
Just mind blowing,5
"The left tower speaker only ticks when switched on/volume is changed. No music coming out of there. Good hardware build quality, great product design, however has failed to work. Have requested for a return and waiting for the same.",1
"Amazon plays major role in the cheating with this product , customer care will not support , product is worst it is not working but still Amazon people are not replacing the item üò°. Don't buy using Amazon, it useful only to buy product within 500.",1
Its been 3 months I have been using this awesome product and do not have any complaints. Being a music teacher i am totally satisfied by the indepth sound of bass and treble. Blutooth connectivity is an added advantage and stylish look is like an icing on the cake. Won't solve the purpose for outdoor parties or big rooms.,5
"Its really an awesome product and sonething you would get in reasonable price. Sound quality and the bass, both are just mindblowing and moreover, the product suits to even you compact personal space so smartly.
Overall, the product is worth it.",4
"Sound quality is good but the product we get is totally damaged ,even the product does not come in proper packing,both tower speaker is damaged",4
Value for money,5
One tower is crack,5
"The is too poor, dont buy this product beacuse you wont be able to refund it.
Philips is making fool out of us selling this cheap 2.0 speaker. Just because of the design dont buy it because the speaker music quality is too poor.üëéüèª",1
Best quality and worth purchasing it.,5
"The product we got was in damaged condition. Both the subwoofers were in damaged. Even the packaging wasn't proper. The sound quality is good but as we increase the volume it becomes worse.
Not satisfied with the product.
I will replace the product.",1
"DISSAPOINTMENT.
IT was a waste of money.

Fantastic bass crisp sound ...a must buy product in the range .go for it without bothering anything,5
The volume control does'nt worked for the product above the system. At first this was working very smoothly & it was fab then the volume key stopped working ie if the volume is high then its high u can't control it.,1
"Best under 3k . Bt connectivity is excellent
In full volume there is no distortion. Excellent budget alternative for expensive soundbars",4
Product is excellent for this price range.. Installation is a walk in the park. Best thing I liked in this is Bluetooth and Aux both are there. Drawback is that the wire lenth is too short so cannot place the speaker too far away from the woofer.. Overall this is an excellent product.. Can go for it,4
"The speaker hangs in between and is not playing in sequence.. only 2 days old.
Last one was exchanged and it was having sound problem..
Philips is not up to the mark any more.
It has lost its quality",2
"Due to the name of the Philips company, I bought it online from Amazon without seeing it and without listening to it, but it is very poor here, its voice is very slow and the quality is not too.",1
"Good sound and Bass. FM reception is decent, but some channels are not very clear. BT is easy to connect and clear BT range is average, more than 5 meters is sometimes an issue.",5
"Super sound , blutooth is very nice, FM radio also working nice all over super product",4
"100% satisfied with. I m writing this review after getting a 2nd time product as a replacement. Product is so good, like the bass, crystal sound quality etc. Worth of it.",5
"Speaker output is very clear and excellent.

Bass output is excellent.

Bass can be adjusted by using remote.

Cons:
Wire length is short.",5
Sound quality very poor.....item dimension differ as mentioned in specifications...,1
Looks are good but sound output is average. Go for JBL soundbar (investing 3-4K extra).,2
Design is very good and sound quality also. Speaker also good but cable is very short from speaker to woofer...woofer is also very good...,5

Sound quality is very good but some noise is coming from subwoofer cabinet. Like lose part hitting noise.,3
Product is very good. Bass is nice. Looking good. But amazon packing is very very poor. There is no amazon packing even no stiker only main unit packet i have got. It is very hopeless for me.,5

1. Remote batteries are not included in the package
2. Fit for the devices which are having audio stereo 3.5mm port (example: pc to headphone port)
3. Speakers are not wireless and it needs to connect with wire.",3
"Nice product from Philips.
Pro:
Has 2 aux inputs.
Sound Clarity
Good bluetooth range.
Excellent bass .. has a bass level setting 0... 30
Cons:
Remote feels cheap.Range is not great. There appears a lag between remote usage and its effect.
Speakers are not mesh protected. The speaker membrane is exposed. Not an issue if speakers are out of reach of children.
Complete antena set not provided. Only a wire comes with the package.",4
Good product for bass lovers. Good enough to rock your living room. For USB and FM the min bass level itself is loud enough. I have connected it to my LED tv AUX port and it delivers high quality sound for HD channels. The product specs says the subwoofer is 30W with 2 satellite speakers 15W X 2. It is actually 26WX1 + 17WX2. The only disadv I could point out is that the connection cables are too small and you need to keep the satellite speakers close to the woofer itself. You might need to order extension cables for atleast one of the speakers. RCA female to male cables are available. The packing was good and the product looked brand new.,4
"With 60W sound output and bluetooth connectivity, these speakers are perfect for playing music, games, movies and online videos on mobile phones and TV.One disadvantage is it catches signal from STB remote and the system defaults to 20 volume when we switch on.We can pair even Apple products with the bluetooth connectivity.FM reception is very good provided you properly place the antenna wires.",4
"OK as per price range. The remote is tiny and very fragile. The speaker mesh / grill on the right side of the Master Unit is covered with flimsy fabric, which won't last long. A sturdier mesh would have been preferable. BT pairing is seamless. Bass beyond +15 causes sound distortion.

Philips is a Dutch company, with subsidiaries all over the world, including Philips India. Was surprised to note that this is not a product of India, but imported from China. Hence, it is actually China made. Rest I leave to your imagination.",4
"1. Sound is OK. Bass is deep but not that tight. Mids are a bit hard to reproduce.
2. The controls are very bad. The Bass has a separate channel (VOLUME) alltogether. So, you have to adjust the bass everytime you increase or decrease the volume. Really Phillips????
(Even at 0 volume if you increase the bass level, the woofer units starts growling)
3. Radio reception is very nice. BUT you cannot save more than 5 FM channels in your presets. Very Bad!
4. Bluetooth connectivity is very nice.
5. WIRES!! very very short wires provided for the satellites.
6. Satellite speakers are not powerful enough as per the looks. In case of increased bass level during movie effects, they start distorting. I have asked for a replacement.

Overall its OK if you want an immovable bluetooth speaker system at a corner of your room. But dont expect high quality sound from it.",3
"Sound clarity,bass quality,ease of setup & use 10/10. Just stop searching here. Compliments your TV.Best bargain on this price",5
"First of All Great Thanks to Amazon for their prompt delivery as usualn Thanks for clear description of product on site. Same product i ordered from Flipkart.. But they delivered damaged product that too different.
Now about the product. Simply Awesome. Nice sound qyality.. Bass superb.. Elegant Look.. FM works properly.. Bluetooth functions well.. Connected with my Samsung LED TV. Only one cons is that no Bass control nob...u have to keep your remote very safe.... But overall Must Buy product for Bass Lover with Elegant Look. Thank u Amazon.",5
"I was initially skeptical about these speakers, because the last time my Philips headphones didn't deliver.

This time, I faced an issue where the left speaker did not deliver the volume correctly. I was unable to reach Philips Customer Support; I returned it immediately, Amazon replaced it, it works fine now. I would tell you to QA your unit immediately after it arrives. Connect only the left speaker, then only the right speaker. Now repeat this after swapping the ports. Ensure everything works as designed.

They do not ship a pair of batteries with the remote, and I think Philips/Sellers could potentially help with it.

I faced an issue where the left speaker did not deliver the volume correctly.

The FM wire shipped could have a loop/better finish. But even without connecting it, I have decent reception.

Now for the real review: These speakers have excellent bass, zero humming/buzzing at high volumes. I played my usual bass playlist to test it out. It delivers. The bluetooth works, the range is around 5-15m, depending on the obstructions. No complaints, because the real functionality is there. But Philips must work on the little things, and have a better QA process.",4
"I am really Glad to Have this Product from Amazon.
It stopped working after 5 days.
I am using with Asus x99-a MB, those are providing great output for music.
Even sony xperia sp is giving nice bass for bluetooth.
i recommend for a starter/first time buyer of speakers.
now i am buying 5.1 speakers for better surround",4
"As usaual amazon has delivered this product late as well. One day after promised delivery date.
Now lets come to the product.
Looks: Premium look in budget. Sound bar is a ice breaker, capable of being tower convertible as well.
Quality: No doubt in quality, build is amazing, sturdy and heavy.
Sound : Well this is the most important thing we buy speakers for. You hear everything in amazing details, bass, treble and almost every beat is crisp and clear. N maximum sound its equivalent to party speakers.
Loving its sound.Very close competitor to Sony in this range, infact surpasses it in matter of features.
Features: Bluetooth, FM, convertible sound bar, remote control.

Verdict: Best buy if u are not ready to shed more and can be happy with 2.1.",5
The bass speaker and the mid range speakers do not complement each other well.You need to keep the bass almost at minimum level to get acceptable match between speakers.Other wise the performance of the product and the options available to play music is good.,4
"Superb safe packing by amazon fast delivery before expecting date
Very very nice product
I am 100 % satisfied with this product at this price range Bluetooth connectivity is working fantasticly to my devices nice quality of sound
Thank you all",5
"No word for this product in this price range. Get USB, AUX , SD card , Bluetooth connectivity as well as FM radio and 6000W output sound with great clarity. I guess one can connect to any possible device with this speakers",5
"JUST BUY IT! 6000 PMPO! 60W OUTPUT! DO I NEED TO SAY MORE? AWESOME EXTRA DEEP BASS! DONT SAVE 500-1000 RUPEES ON LOWER MODELS!
COMPARED TO ALL LOWER AND SIMILAR MODELS (INCLUDING SONY D9) UNDERPERFORM COMPARED TO THIS MODEL!
JUST BUY IT! TRUST ME!",5
"Good for a normal speaker ,, but it didn't get connected to my Sony Bravia tv,, so ve just blue connectivity and fm to listen to,, it could ve been better
The extra wire as suggested by Amazon is not required as the manufacturer only includes it",2
"Good speakers with crisp vocals and thump bass. More than enough for a big room. What i liked about the product is the design, beautifully crafted and looks quite good when kept.
What i didnt liked is, that there is only 1 speaker in the towers making it an attempt of show only ! Could have been much value for money if atleast 2 speakers would be there in a single tower. Although the output is good and you would love the incredible bass ! A HDMI input could have made it a beast, but again it serves the purpose quite well.",3
Product is very good when it comes to bass. Only problem I feel that it has got a pre-setting for bass and one has to really struggle to keep the bass low everyone you ON it. But then you have got remote for it. Who the hell bothers to move there ass off when you have a remote in your hand. Very good sound and mind boggling bass. Proudly stands with Sony music systems.,5
"Bass lovers Wil simply love it
Superb bass
Bluetooth pairing and playing is flawless
The Equalizer work only in pendrive mode and FM mode
Would have been great if it had a treble switch on the remote
Clarity is a little bit on the lower side..however we can always adjust with the Equalizer of smartphone or laptop or the in built Equalizer depending on the source input.....I really love the product...under 4000 not much of complaints",4
"Good buy for the price.Performance is trouble free, Bluetooth connection is quick and sound quality is good for the price.Base is powerful.Channel separation could be better.Only Minus points- Wire with the speakers is too short- less than 3 feet ( ideal distance between left and right speakers should be as close as possible to 8 feet for a small room or 12 ft for a large one).The flashing LEDs while on standby can be disturbing especially at night.",4
It works like magic and is a perfect selection for indoor use. Here is the sound quality I recorded and published on youtube [...],5
Awesome product... Got this product from an offline store at rs6500... At this point of price awesome bass output... Crystal clear vocals.. just go for it.. better than sony d100.,5
"Amazon delivery: perfect
cons :
bass is little exaggerated
Cannot lower the volume to very low.
Pros :
for the price we get bluetooth,pendrive, fm, aux in
Satellite speakers very good
Philips brand, Nice looking, warranty
FM reception good but can be better",4
First of all awesome Amazon........ Super fast delivery....... and that even rural area.....and NYC package...now cum to the product...... awesome product ...bass is extreme and controllable ...fm is also awesome.......good product Philips.....good for music.....I gave 4 stars bcoz the satellite speakers wires are too short...can't fix it in the walll......other thn that its an awesum product..........if u want just for music and FM.......go for it.............,4
"The product has been delivered 3 days back to me . Been testing the sound now I can say 6600 rs a great deal comparison to others in this range . FM , bluetooth , sd card and usb works fine .

Best part of the speaker's is design . It can be use as bar speakers or can be use as tube speakers . The volume control is amazing guys .",5
Amazing product. Bluetooth connectivity is so simple with mobile device to play music. Hats off to PHILIPS for affordable system marketing and thanks to amazon for selling such products.,5
"The Speaker has a Constant low humming noise when its turned on, even if there is nothing plugged in.

And after 2 weeks of using the Speaker there are ""Phut Phut"" sounds while playing music.",1
The woofer is huge so packed box is pretty heavy. Philips packed new item was good. The woofer base is awesome. No batteries included. Drawback 1. The speaker connecting wires are small in length (less than a meter in length). 2. The system does not save previous settings. 3. No bass and treble settings on the device. Bass setting present on the remote.,4
"A great product from Philips. Everyone who loves pure bass should buy. Booming bass, thunderous bass. Objects in your home will start shaking. I really love the product. Use pen drive for best results.",5
"Nice item initially damaged product came, one sat speaker, blue tooth connection in phone, USB not worked. called customer care and booked replacement. Second one intact. If you want to see the bass effect in all sounds to kicking, minimum volume is 11, otherwise feels like laptop speakers , previous used several creative speakers, build quality is bad compared to them. Not even single screw in sat speaker, if they fell down they split open.",5
"The bass is amazing! Although if you dont like bass much then u might not like this because even at lowest possible bass its still high considering overall sound , otherwise it has great connectivity options, FM etc . Which are not found in this price range from any other brand.",5
"The speaker is damaged, got a replacement speaker, but still i got minor damages.

Speaker quality is good but for 7800 Rs i am still getting a damaged piece.

Even the outer box is damaged.",1
"It is an excellent music speakers. Bass is just too good. No hummmming soind at all. Fm receiver is bery very good. Remote have all d functions. was planning to buy MMS 4545 model but thn i listen to this model and sound quality was jz too good and diff is jz Rs 500.
In arnd 4k this is d best buy. For house party n all this is ideal. One thing misssing is meshh net to small speaket... have to buy cover for it.",5
"Yes after 2 days I am doing this review specially, for all and I just want to say about these speakers just one word, awesome. Don't think guys it's Philips, just place the speakers correctly at the right place at right distance and you will listen the fabulous surrounding sound in your room at only volume 1 and bass 1(in the night at the silence) pure bass and pure sound. I am just listing arijit singh songs through bluetooth and at the same time I am typing also. I am not bluffing I am posting a pic also while listing just see yourself I am listing music on just volume-1. Right now the time is 1:10 am. I am telling the time because I am telling about the volume. The 2nd speaker is on the right side can't cime in the pic. Any way so, just don't think it too much just buy it. Philips to have a service center in Kanpur. So just go for it. A big thumsup for this productüëç",5
"One of the best products, philips has made...excellent delivery by Amazon... All requirements of a home theater are satisfying.. Cost seems to be high when compared to other products. . But once u receive the product... U forget it....must buy product",5
Amazing product. Connecting via blue tooth. Very smart way of playing songs via blue tooth. Happy when I am able to play videos also via phone without connecting with wires. Thanks Philips for such a nice speaker. Could have been better while playing songs in high volume. Disturbing hmm sound when the volume is 29 & 30. Thanks Amazon too nice package.,5
"Product is worth,
Pro :
1 Mobile Bluetooth compatible so nice, Any time you can play without connecting your Mobile to this device physically
2 Bass is very good
3 Delivery pack is good
4 you can keep away this model from kids still you can connect via Bluetooth
5 Some songs vibration very good you will literally feel it

Con: volume can be increased little more from 30 to 50 max, because some of bad quality songs can't hear good with max volume",5
"Great sound system for the price I paid. Woofer is good enough for the hall, place is on a wooden plank, sounds even better. The jogger isn't that responsive, and the remote is very flimsy, could be better. Considering the low price you get usb, SD and radio along with Bluetooth connectivity, it looks amazing and sounds good too.",5
"Super quality product. Big bass. Clear voice. You can use out door and indoor use. Bluetooth range is awesome. I really love it. But speaker wire is not lengthy. We can extends without cutting the wire, i also used connector. And this is not a problem. Thank you philips and amazon....‚ò∫",5
"Remote is not powerfull. It is not sensing easially. Should change it immediately.

Anil Singj Biswas",4
"bass is good not best.. bass sounds good only till level about 80%... after that bass try to distort and dubb dubb sound comes out
speakers are average only.. bar is for show off only and also too long ...only one speaker present there inside the bar
bass control is by remote only
volume can be control by both remote and box
remote control is very nice from everywhere
bluetooth is easily to connect and play",4
"superb sound quality, superb bass with 30 bass level, 60 watts power, Bluetooth connectivity allowing wireless experience, all control with Remote control, PHILIPS",5
"Cheapest, good quality, branded, 2.1 setup Bluetooth speaker out there that you can get.
Somewhat content with the audio quality but cons for me personally are:
1. Often leaves this very irritating low frequency static noise especially when the speakers aren't in use. Putting it on 'Standby' doesn't help either leaving me with no alternative other than to physically put off the mains after I'm done using the speakers. (There are no interfering wires from other sources, or nearby devices. The satellites have been kept almost as far apart as possible on either side of the subwoofer) -- If anyone has a solution to this, I'd be happy to know.
2. Cables for the satellites connecting the subwoofer are short. Wish they were longer",4
"I am absolutely loving the system. I did not specifically choose the system to play loud music or high bass, but for music itself. The sound is crisp and clear. I liked the fact that there are 2 RCA inputs (pair), you can connect from 2 different systems. Bluetooth and FM work fine. Bluetooth connectivity is quick. It would have been nice to have a display panel, where you can see the FM channel details etc. You can control bass through the remote which is great. The packaging was good and delivered on time.",5
"Best Sound Quality like DJ Sound, but packing very poor quality boofer is breakage I have to request replace it",5
The product is value for money but one disappointment is that there is no folder changing option on the remote or the system which makes it very difficult to switch to folders of the pen drive or SD card .,4
"Very nice in connectivity with different types of gadgets like mobile,laptop... through blue tooth.But there is no way to adjust(increase/decrease) treble in Woofer or remote.

Remote also very small in size and equalizer function is available in USB mode only.",3
I love it. Great sound quality. Boom boom bas. Excellent bluetooth connectivity. Thanks to philips for a good product & thanks to amazon for timely delivery.,5
"Best product, superb bass,I ve converted tower into single bar n placed below TV
Great connectivity,rich FM output",4
"Speakers give quality sound with excellent bass, inbuilt bluetooth is an another add on attribute making it user freindly enabling u to attaching ur phones laptops etc without aux cable nd wid awesom sound quality. FM mode also works perfect.",5
"As soon as I started playing music via Bluetooth, after some time speaker started making noise and I saw flame coming out of it, I switch it off immediately and now it's not working at all
Fake product! .. Amazon please take this product back immediately",1
This product is very Nice one...no issues at all ....go for it...but the way in which it was delivered was pathetic...i will never b purchasing anything from amazon in future...believe that..,3
Nice sound quality with good bass. The default bass might sound too much. You need to adjust it with remote. Otherwise the sound clarity and quality is good. Nice speakers in this price range. I got it for 4000/-,5
"Had great hopes of this but as fate would have it I was disappointed. To begin with the bluetooth would not function, all else was fine. I decided to return it and got it replaced. Now this second one has a different kind of problem. From outside on can see evidence of severe impact in the bottom corner.. still hoped that it will work as expected. But it was not to be, even at mid volumes the bass makes an awful lot of noise spoiling the party. So am going to return it and may be go for some other brand.",2
Best speakers in so low cost. Must buy. I just loved it.,5
The sub woofer doesn't receive the remote control sensor. What can I do now???? I have bought it yesterday from Amazon,5
"Very disappointing service by seller,right side speaker is not working at all.now have to go with rigorous process of returning where hv to pack stuffs again.also fm antenna not in working condition,aux cable is waste as it Dnt work properly.",1
"It was a truly great surprise, small thing great working. The only disadvantage is that this system does not have controls on the subwoofer, only works through remote.",5
"When I connect this speakers BUZZING sound start coming form Subwoofer...then I restart the speakers but still that sound is coming and can't hear anything from playing songs. and after 30 minutes of usage Subwoofers back got OVERHEATED !!
really bad product or i've got defected one !!",1

"I have received this product yesterday. thanks to amazon for one day delivery for prime members.

"Not as expected..... its good for medium volume... in high volume its noisey... and the wire isnt long enough...
Jbl pulse was awesome... as i have both",3
"Some times bluetooth is getting disconnected,automatically bass is increasing.
It was around 1 year .not that much worth .not preferable.even speakers we cannot attach to wall",2
AWESOME PRODUCT AND MY OLD PHILIPS GOOD BUT THIS PHILIPS HOME THEATER R VERY GOOD AND BASS R SO GOOD.....,5
Amazing product from ohilips well packedand sent by amazon ...thank you Amazon .Awesome deep bass and treble .,5
"Product is just OK. No proper arrangement for FM antenna. Just 1 Mts wire given which is not sufficient to received good signal. Blue tooth signal also receive from only 2-3 mts distance.
Sound quality meet my expectation",3
"The sound quality is good & fills the room pretty well. The first product was not working, had to replace. The replaced product is working fine. Full stars for speaker, but due to faulty product delivery first time, reduced the rating.",3
I experienced the speaker in croma. It's really awesome. But I ordered in Amazon. Only one speaker is working. Worst service from Amazon.,1
"worst purchase ever.... stopped working after 20 days.... although philips sent engineer to solve issue but its not up to the mark... cheap quality aux cable... poor quality connections...

go for Creative speakers if you want quality and performance... ( I am using since last 10 years)",1
"Product is nice and well enough for moderate living room. Bass and voice are seperated clearly. A minure dent on speaker, apart from that.. good. Suggestion - go for it...",5
"Rice bass and awesome sound clarity...
All connectivity BT, FM, AUX, USB, SD ......Nice Product.....",4
Just Superb for Bass lovers,4
"Received the product without any damage. Good product worth the price. If you love Bass, you can buy this.",5
Sound of this spekaer is jentel. Everything is good...but the voice is not that much good...as i assume from it.,3
"I am sure what happened to Phillips, it‚Äôs sounds like any ordinary speaker and Dosent outstand to what I may refer to quality or pleasure to ears",3
Worth the price. Only mysterious thing the bass increases proportional to the volume increase which I personally feel not a good thing.,4
18 january buy this philps model but Bluetooth not working 9march very dissapoint,2
Tge product sounds great but lack few connectivity options such as arv and optical audio port. Other den dat everything is good.,5
Nice product high bass...Bass lover go for it bluetooth connect very fast bass control button is their get in time good conditaion packing was good worth of money..,5
"Worth for money in this price range, good sound quality,
Not up to my expectations.",3
"After one month using the sub woofer started producing sounds like radio signals. Because of this music cannot be heard clearly. Trying to locate service center, that too after just one month of purchase.",1
V good and balance sound quality.,5
"It's really good, for this price it's absolutely worth. Go for it...",4
The sound quality is good and the bass enhancer makes it even better,4
The best speakers good for small space n very nice woofers..... works for small party of 10 to 15 people at home or workplace. Not for large party or outside party,5
"product is good but when i play with mobile by bluetooth , its disconnect automatically.",4
i really happy to invest in this.every time when i get bored from study this is best to refresh my mood.sound quality is totally awesome.best for bachelor to enjoy with friend and masti in room.,5
The speakers are superb very good sound n base 30levels of sound looks good i can see my face in them too shiny,5
Product. Sound Quality is good as expected. Bluetooth Connectivity is good. I am using this product for 2 months.,4
Clarity is not that much good.,2
"Was apprehensive about this particular model as it has been discontinued but was absolutely blown away by the quality and sound output of this 2.1 Sound bar. The sub woofer though a tower woofer is exceptional and the best part is you can control the bass from the remote. The bass is not extremely loud and is more than sufficient for a large room (My room size is around 15x12 ft). The clarity of the speakers is amazing although if you increase the bass to the full then the speaker sound gets slightly low. All in all these speakers are a steal for 5000 (includes the Diwali discount and 10% cashback on SBI Card). I needed a good sound bar for my new VU 50"" TV (as VU TVs have horrible sound) and this product just fit the bill perfectly. I now have a mini home theatre in my room. Please don't be apprehensive about the lack of product info and reviews online as this is an exceptional product though I am also not sure why Philips discontinued it. Buy it if u want a good sound bar/speaker for a large hall. It has Bluetooth, USB and SD card connectivity. The only slight flaw which I could find was that there is no Optical input slot and only RF input is there. Other than that this is a flawless product. The build quality is good and looks are sleek. Go for it you will not regret it.",4
It's bass quality is very nice and Bluetooth device is very powerful.,4
Very poor sound quality. Raised for return but seems amezone not taking directly and routing thru service center.,1
Doesn't have good bass..... poor base quality and lack of 3D sound ..... doesn't satisfy by philips according his name??,2
Low sounds quality. I m no suggest for buying this.,1
I love it......best home theatre I ever had....go for it guyz,5
SUPERB QUALITY SOUND AND FUNCTIONS,5
Worth for Money,4
Great Sound Quality and Bass,5
Amazing Bass.. Amazing Sound.. Best buy for this price range... Go for it without a secind thought... A truly earth shaking experience...,5

Not bass controlled,2
wow filing like multiplex. best price 4079rs i am buy.,5
Very good speakers in this price range.,5
"excellent sound quality and performance, worthful, good looking and enough for medium size halls or rooms.",5
"Ordered on 15th at 12.30 pm and delivered on 17th 10.00 am, got it within 48 hours, it was well packed thanks to Amazon. I compared the price with other online sites and I found the price cheaper on Amazon. I purchased it for my 32 inch Led TV for my 12x12 bedroom. But the sound is good enough for bigger halls and can be used for small parties.
Pros: The sound quality is amazing, generating terrific bass and enhancing the music. We can connect wirelessly with Bluetooth to any Bluetooth compatible device. We can connect through Aux in to almost all the devices. We can play music via the USB and SD card slots. We can connect it to the PC as well. All the buttons are at front and convenient to control. FM reception is excellent. The remote is user friendly and can control everything from the remote itself.
Cons: The display should have been little bigger. We cannot switch on the speakers manually, though there is a power button at the back, we need to use remote, to switch on the speakers. The remote looks cheap, but does the job. Remote batteries are not included in the package. The satellite speakers are not wireless, need to connect with wire.
Overall, it is an excellent music system and must buy for music lovers and gamers.",4
Very poor sound quality. Remote buttons and Bluetooth are not working.,2
Good product very high sounds quality,5

"Very Nice product. Value for money.
Seller sent it by Speed post. Received it one day before expected Delivery. as the box was big, i had to go to the post office to collect it. packaging was poor. just a layer of plastic wrapped around the box.
Now talking about the Product,
Lovely Speakers for a Medium sized room.
Compatible with T.V., Laptop, Mobile, Bluetooth, Radio, USB, SD Card.
Sound is Better that I Expected. Bass is adjustable and of very good quality.
Enjoying it very much.",5
I received damage product,3
Good,4
"Good woofer sound production. (Little over-production, which you can anyway be controlled by Bass controller on remote control.)
Plays well on Bluetooth, connects to USB, mirco-sd card well. It has built-in equalizer. FM reception is superb.

It fills and rocks the 150 square feet room with solid sound easily.
It is absolutely value for money.

Speakers should have mesh cover to protect from damage, but nowadays no one provides the same.
Woofer have mesh in vaccum tunnel. Good.

Yet finding any other negative, but now feels I may not find any negative out of this Juke box further.",4
Really disappointed. Got a defective piece and I'm trying for the last three four days to return the item or even get a replacement done. I'm very disappointed with the service provided by Amazon. I'm not even getting any technical help from Philips. It shud be Amazon's responsibility to replace the item when it is defective. Externally there is no damage but the speakers are not working at all. I never expected this kind of service from Amazon. Please replace the item or else refund the money and take the speakers back. Atleast send a technician to have a look and replace the item. Very disappointed.,1
"Average sound quality...reviews and description are hyped...

Tried different sorts of songs for testing frequency response and clarity...
Clarity is not at par compared to cost..removing most of the sounds having > 4000Hz freq...
312Kbps song will be sound like 64 Kbps...

Bass it, ok, but it should not be the only criteria.

Returned it and buying SONY home theatre",2
"not at all,, the woofer speaker was broken from inside,i had to call service person to repair the new speaker , the quality of sound is not at par ,,the woofer does so much bass that it kills the sound ,if we minus the bass ,the effects fades away ,,,
please suggest if it can be taken back and replaced with a bigger model or another model.....",1
"Amazon did a great job delivering product much earlier than expected, however would like to share my experience about this product based upon couple of days of use....

Pros:
1)Speakers small in size, yet deliver powerful sound.
2)Multiple features like Bluetooth, USB, FM radio, Aux in, remote control, etc.
3)Previous Volume level is maintained upon next power on.
4)Good looks.
5)All these comes at comparatively cheaper price.

Cons:
1)Too much bass, irritation if you listen for a longer time. This may be due to bass reflex type of speakers.
2) Satellite speakers seems to be a bit smaller in comparison with the power generated by amplifiers.
3)No equilizer in Radio, Bluetooth, Aux mode. Only bass control available. Equilizer works only in USB and SD card mode.",3
Sound quality is crystal clear. Bass is amazing. Bluetooth connectivity is instantaneous and takes only few secs.,5
"Excellent speakers, I have attached it with my 42 inch Samsung Smart TV. The sound clarity is good and bass is terrific. Also has FM, blue tooth and hence worth investing in. I use in my drawing room which is rather big- 35 feet X 20 feet and the sound effect is very good. Only complaint is that it is a bit overpriced but since the product is not China made, it is ok.",4
"The speaker is not working and even after raising query, no one yet come to repair. Also Amazon did not respond. Bad service.",1
"Crisp and clear sound, for this price range this 2.1 is best. Great Bass punch, but treble control is missing anways it delivers good clear sound with apt bass effect",4
in the details of this product the speaker connectivity is shown as wireless but in actual its wired. Dont cheat with customers. in return section no option to return this product on the basis of wrong features/details.,1
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I searched a lot for a 2.1 channel multimedia speakers. Wanted something with decent bass and satellite speakers with clear voice. I came across many reviews stating bass is excellent and yes it is! The vocals can be heard clearly even with full bass. However, the volume of satellite speakers should have been a bit more loud. It has bass control to reduce it via remote. Searched for Boat Avaante's many versions but the ones which would fit in this budget had low sound quality. The Sony SA-D20 does not have bass control, else it was the best choice. I did not want to spend a lot, as we tend to buy new speakers atleast in 2-3 years. I got it for Rs. 6199. You can check the video for bass quality..",4
"Great product with the value of money.... And this one is really for bass lovers.clearity is dam too good, looks much preety but remember from inside it's a beast.i will recommend this product, go for it.",5
"this is not home teater it just multedia speaker ,not 5.1 only 2.1 and its not 6000 watts only 60 watts.",1
itna gatia product hai bhaiyo koi mat lena 2nd time bhi kharab home theater bhej diya simply wastage of money nd time koi mat lena chor hai Sab....,1
"Sound is very good under 4000 INR. In some reviews before I purchased I read that the bass is very loud & cannot be decreased but I found it very different. The bass is very big but you can decrease it. Say for example I am increasing the volume to 15 then the bass also get automatically increased so I had to reduced the bass again to 1 or 3 to get good clarity. I think there should have been a knob for controlling the volume & bass manually without the remote, then it would have been very good. One should take care of the remote because many of the functions can only be controlled from the remote only. One more thing I read it in earlier reviews before buying that the sound & bass default is 20 but it is not true you can set the default volume & bass as you wish so that when you put the power on you can have your own sound effect. The sound effect can shake a medium size room with good source of music.",5
"Wish it had bass control button & volume level displayed on TV screen when remote controlled. FM antenna is merely a wire.
Everything compensates to sound quality & awesome design to date. Amsome HD movies & DTS sound experience at home!!",5
"I brought it from a showroom nearby for 5300. The sound quality is super clear.. Good bass.

The stereo speakers are awesome and well built with quality. Sub woofer effect is breath taking.. Remote has bass control.

Over all worth music system for home and small offices.",5
"1. The product I received was faulty
2. The speakers which were working did not produce a good sound, which may have been because of the fact that the unit was fautly",1
Please do not buy this product. First I received a defected product. The replacement which I have received worked fine for 45 days after which again one of the speaker is making noise instead of playing the music. Worst ever experience. Please go for F&D or other better brands. Request for support from Amazon as how to claim warranty for my purchase.,1
"This product is waste of money, Output from the main unit for left side speaker stopped working after a week, already tried with service team but no resolution yet.",1
"Good product which is adequate for home use. Would have been nicer if it included an AM tuner. The Philips logo on the woofer was probably stuck by hand as it is tilted to the right. Obviously, poor QC even though it has no bearing on audio quality.",4
"It's not worth for that price, audio quality and sound is very poor, bass only coming sound is very poor",1
On showroom I listened the sound of this music which was very high. But on receiving it through Amazon I think the sound is slightly low as compared to that. May be I am wrong but I think there is some difference.,3
"I bought this offline for 12990/-. I had to replace it as it was defective.
As for the sound quality, it delivers beyond my expectations. Before buying this, I had a JBL BAR 3.1 which I sold online on ""___ pe bech de"" appüòú.
I had to sell the jbl one because the mids were not audible at all so we were not able to enjoy r.d. burman songs which have generous use of bass guitar.
The sound quality is amazing! The entire frequency spectrum can be heard clearly without the bass being offensive. This is a great system for such a low price tag. Plus my mother wanted fm which it has with great reception and quality.
Pros:
1. Great sound quality. Very soothing and relaxing with a punchy bass.
2. Low price
3. Able.to play via bluetooth, optical cable, auxiliary cable, fm, usb.
4. Can be used as tower speakers or as a 2.1 sound bar.

Cons:
1. Build quality could have been better. Not the materials used but the assembly. Even with the replaced piece, the woofer front cover is loose which vibrates when bass is increased.
2. Remote is fairly responsive.

Overall this piece is good. Just check it after unboxing for operational defects because the build quality is so-so. At such a low price you get fm, bt, usb, optical, aux! What more do you want...!",5
Super bass music system.,5
"before this i had F&D A180X the sound clarity of that product is awesome but bass was not that powerful.
bught this speaker from flipkart in big billion day sale cause of sbi card offer.
speaker is loud and really good with few cons:
1. sound clarity is little low in comparison with A180X.
2. bass changes itself with the increase n decrease in sound. so u may have to set basse everytime u change the volume.
3. Faced bluetooth auto disconnect issue 1 time.
4. be careful with the bass u can damage ur speaker cause bass has no limit. there are 30 levels or steps for both sound and bass volume separately. if u have set bass to the maximum level(30) at low volume level(suppose 1) and then u increase the volume the bass also starts to increase beyond its limit with the volume and subwoofer starts to crackle at volume level between 5 and 10. if u further increase the volume the subwoofer will get damage for sure.
5. remote design is really poor. it works but looks like a cheap chinese 3rd class product.

pros:
1. the bass is really awesome far better than A180X
2. loud with decent vocals and poor treble. There is a lack of crispness in sound.
3. FM with good reception.
4. bluetooth version 4.0 or 4.2(it is 4.0 in manual but 4.2 on official site).
5. overall sound signature is little bit warmer side.",2
Nice product,5
Very bad product. The woofer has so much of noise. FM does not catch channels. The remote doesnot work. One of the speaker base stand is missing.,1
Bluetooth option is does not work properly. Speaker connections are failure. Why does not satisfy this home theatre.,1
"Please do not buy this product.
It's the Pathetic one. Speakers are very small and bass quality is very poor in addition to that 1 speaker is not working. I have tried to return it on the same day when it was delivered, Amazon denied to take it back and said we have changed our return policies, now you have to contact Philips and ask them to repair the same.
1st time I have experienced such type of answer from Amazon.
Never ever recommend to anyone.",1
Worst product. It's bass is worst than by 1600rs speaker.Just power output doesn't mean better sound and bass. Better buy iball booster 5.1...,1
Got this one after returning F&D A 520 ... If u r looking for quality .. u r at wrong place..this piece offers a heavy bass (rather a woofing bass not punchy bass) and the mids ( what I think will make the speakers speak their class) are definitely not good...if u want to listen that mids like guitar /flute u cannot do it because the satellites play mids with that shrill..u cannot listen to them at high volume... So .. quantity u have a lots of it...quality...ney..I am surprised how company like Philips can offer this kind of product.. my 6th class BPL stereo handled mids better than this..even hardest of the bass lovers would not dare to increase bass to more that 2 or 3..that only adds to the wooph..vibrating ya window panes..So I suggest going for Sony 2.1 ..if u r that quality guy..if u wanna dance to the music have a home party lots of sound..go for it..,2
"its a super sound speaker by philips.. philips a well known brand for electronics and sound system..

mine was purchased 2 years ago. still working same as new and looks new..
u have to take a proper care for electronics items.

.
some people just dont care there product and then they broke it. and blame the company..

if u r getting low sound in bluetooth connection.. plz use some other phone or use mx player for music..
using cable is recommend for super high sound.",5
Bekar product hai 15 din Baad hi kharab ho Gaya...koi plss bataye meh kya Karu..plss help me,1
"Honest review!!
Sound quality is very goodd
Bass can be controlled and is ground shaking!!
After 2 months of purchase....I faced an issue that it suddenly stopped working while playing songs
But it was in warranty so I took it to service centre and they returned it back within 2 days and now it is working at it's best.
Overall It's a good system within this price range.",5
"I was circumspect to buy this.. I needed a speak system for my bedroom.. I already have a Sony 5.1 home Theater which I bought for 60K..

This product really surprised me.. excellent sound quality and great bass with bass control..

Worth the money you spend.. I got a better deal not from Amazon though and got it at 5399 at another e-commerce site during their big billion day sale..

Go for it guys.. great speakers..",5
"I bought this item with a great expectation. Even though it comes from a great brand, and looks good, I feel it could have been better.

Pros :
1. Good Looking
2. Remote Control, with all necessary options, and Equalizer
3. Woofer, and satellite's size and look
4. FM reception is good, also : sound quality is a bit voice focused.
5. Bluetooth
6. Bass quality is excellent for listening 80's style of music with Tabla sounds.

Cons :
1. Though the 'Bass' is extraordinary, it feels too much in most cases
2. No Volume and Bass Knobs, to control the volume while switching ON
3. Default volume is 20, which makes you uncomfortable (running for the remote to reduce volume)
4. Maximum low volume itself is little louder,
5. Maximum low Bass itself is little high,
6. In both above case of points 4 & 5 in cons, trying to reduce one step low, either makes volume to 'mute', and in case of 'Bass' it becomes no Bass
7. 'hmm' sound due to the heavy bass(i.e) not crystal clear audio

Not up to the looks, But it depends on your taste as well. If anyone has a solution for default volume issue, please suggest me. Thanks.",3
"Audio quality is good. The Bass has its own thump, signature clarity of Philips. Only two cons I have seen is that the Satellite speakers do not have holes to hang on and the folder change is not available on Remote.",4
"Superb sound quality. Minor internal vibrations are noted.

Remote signal angle is very less.

Music wont even start without remote.
If remote gets damaged because of battery leakage, systems dead beat. U cant buy this remote nor service center can provide you with one. Remote is very important!!!

Bluetooth is little shakky. Disconnects sometimes. Dont know where is fault.",4
"I'm over all satisfied with this sound monster. There is a perfect balance between bass and treble effect. Also, thanks to Amazon for faster delivery.",4
"I am using since past 3 years. A decent sound quality in this price range. It has a good bass, treble. It has bluetooth connection, aux connection available. It can be connected to computer, laptop, tv and can be played by mobile via bluetooth. it has wired antenna given at the back. Remote is provided with it. It really a good complete speaker. The major.. major drawback according to me is whenever you increase the volume the bass automatically goes up and vice versa. Every single time you will have to decrease or increase the bass as soon as you adjust the volume which is very very annoying atleast to me.",3
Not as expected & not worth according to the price you can choose better products & brands compared to Philips,1
"Philips, as the name says the product is good. The sound is good and there is a good balance of bass and treble with decent customization settings. Everything is fine except for the damages to the speakers and the packaging. There are dents on the speakers and the subwoofer casing is damaged.",3
"I bought this in 2019 from philips center and just few days back only... whenever I am connecting with Bluetooth and turning up volume,some kind of noise distortion occurred in left speaker. So I got it repaired from service center and again within 2days only the noise distortion started with the right speaker. I don't recommend this product nor brand.Infact invest more money and buy from Sony or JBL. These days, none of the products long last like earlier.",2
It is very very bad product. I am very disappointed after purchase it. After purchase I use only 14days and it is stop working. After register complain both side Amazon & Philips customer care but still today above passed 2 month my problem not solved yet. They still arranging part which is faulty but not get it yet. Worst product & services. I am not not getting repair product or replacement after many time request to customer care. I suggest every one please Don't purchase.,1
"I am writing this review after 2 months of extensive usage, I got this product from croma store, after doing research for quite some days I have finally decided go for this product, it did not disappoint me in any way, as far build quality is concerned it's very good, the design is clean and the sound quality is excellent, especially the bass is on spot. My room is 240 sq ft room and this speaker holds truly good for this sized room. I usually connect via bluetooth and AUX , connecting to buletooth is a piece of cake. it connects quickly, I did not use USB though till now, 1 or 2 times bluetooth connectivity got lost, but it never happened again from then, I'm not sure what could have caused this issue. However at times bass changes if I change(increase) the volume,i am not sure whether this is a expected functionality or a problem? . Apart from this I did not find any other glitches. Couple of general tips guys, make sure that u plug it to spike guard in case u r facing electricity fluctuations and also don't push the speaker beyond it's limits I mean long hours of listening with full bass and loud volume, that may heat up your subwoofer and may lead to other unwanted issues.",4
Base sound very low.. 1500 rs worthable only... Just speaker sound only .....,2
"I had Philips ms4040F model which was good, but it dont have bluetooth. So i went for this model.
Totally wasted my time and money. Normal TV sound is better than this speakers.
Never thought to buy this model. you can go for some other model in Philips.",1
wrong information within namenof product. the name provided hives false or misleading info about the product. it says 5.1 channel while actually it is 2.1 channel music system,1
"The thing I hate most is the customer care service. I had registered a complaint on 5th dec 2019, technician attended d problem on18th dec 2019 and concluded that d display card should be replacd. The technician again came on 18th dec but could not rectify saying that d audio card is faulty and would take the set to d workshop 4 repairs,normally d techicians take d part and repairs in the workshop they don't take d whole set but in my case as there was no option I had to give d set against my will, now I am keeping my fingers crossed and wishing that none of d original parts are taken out and d system is up as promised by the technician within 2 days.",3
"Awesome product...
Trust me..This is the best branded speaker you can get at reasonable price.
I bought it for 3,425/- while it has printed MRP of 5,290/-
These are real 6000w pmpo speakers
Shattering base, dynamic n powerful mids, crisp n sharp highs.
What else you need?",5
Extremely poor sound quality. A lot of buzz like noise is heard when its volume crosses 50 % of its max limit. Bass isnt smooth and heavy. Bass starts to vibrate at high volume. Playing loud music on it is for ruining the vibe of the song. Treble is no good. It is extra shrill. All in all neither the beat nor the song is at mercy. It slays both of them. Bluetooth connectivity is not bad but it is not good also. Remote control works fairly well. But no one would like to spend this much amount of money on a poor speaker with nice remote. On the positive side it looks more asthetic than many of the showpeices one has in his/her room.,1
I have been using this product since 1 year. Clear sound . More than enough base. Easy to use. Full satisfaction. No noise at full sound. It can shake your house at full sound. Bluetooth connectivity. Adjustment of base and volume from remote. And you can on the same time connect it with t.v. best product at this range. No complaint. Only one con.. that is. The buttons on the woofers is not so good. It looks great but you have to aplly more pressure to use the buttons. But i dont use it because i do it with the remote. Overall again 10 out of 10.. it can beat 5.1 speakers. Of samsung. In terms of quality and area coverage,5
This product got everything of best quality. Its very deep and soft bass give you nice experience & its elegant look have very rich feel. Product quality is also very good. If anyone looking for a music system which fills your living room with clear sound along with bass effect than surely go for it. One of the best speakers I brought till date ... The bass is good and the design gets most of the credit .. I can use them as speakers or a bar :),5
Replaced two time...bt again received broken and damage item,1
"Nice product
Only fm not working properly
Tuning section is eorst
Best audio system in this price range
Base is good",5
"I'm writing this review after using the speakers for one week. It must be noted that it's best used with TVs, not for general music listening purpose. First thing you can notice is it's shape - it's massive. It's really good in this price range. Next is the bass which is quite deep and consistent. The quality of the output is entirely dependent on the source. If you are playing from usb/aux you would get it's maximum output quality. It's really bad with mobile via Bluetooth, the quality is really bad with respect to other cheap devices in the market. The most worst thing in this speaker is it's treble, you can't believe - treble is horrible. Also you can't adjust it. Overall this is decent speaker and I would recommend MMS2160B instead.",3
"Can please send me remote link
I want to buy it
My remote was gone
Since 4 year I'm using this Home theater I'm very happy with this good experience and good performance

Anyone please send me remote link",4
"I had a worst experience with this product. I had never returned any product earlier, but this product made me to do so. The sound it produces will irritates you very quickly, makes lot of noise. The only good thing about this product is Bluetooth connectivity and all other features are disaster.",1
"Great product from Philips and the offers was available with some discounts.

Sound quality is awesome in terms of bass and treble balance.",4
I am writing the review after one month use. It is one of the best system to go for home use. Best part is we can set speakers as towers or as a bar. We need to set the base for best results. Bluetooth works well I'll always connect to tv with Bluetooth and I won't use the audio output wire.,4
"Philips Customer care is really pathetic, it seems Philips is only interested to sell and is not bothered about support....I have an audio system which needed Servicing and Philips Service Center person upfront told me they do not support old products, all efforts to reach Philips Customer care were futile....Philips India is taking its customers for a ride....There are better customer oriented companies....do not invest in a company which is unresponsive to customers...",1
"I purchased it from croma for 6800. It is too good for large halls. Im totally happy for this. For normal users I recommend this. If you want every sound/music to be crystal clear, then stay away from this.",5
Cheated by Amazon. This product was gifted to me by my son. The FM radio was not working. I wanted to return the product. But Amazon was postpoding the request with various excuses till the date of return expired. Now I am burdened with a non working product with no responsibility from Amazon side,1
Nothing much to complain about the product. Great bass and effect. Good for the TV if you have no intention of changing position often.,4
"Philips service is very bad,i have bought this product but unfortunately home theater internal circuit is burn and philips customer service executive told me that burn condition of circuit is not covered warranty that's why the service of Philips is very bad...

Connection are very simple",5
"Must buy product. But i didnt bought it from amazon but from a local store. It is been working well from past 8 months. And still works. Except it has 2 cons
1. Short wire for speakers.
2. Bass when kept high it sounds weird when kept above 15 or 20.
When u buy this product and start playing songs in it u will see that some smell is coming from the woofer. I think it is the smell of plastic. But it doesnt effect anything to the speaker.",5
"Bought this product off line 3 year back, its still in perfect condition. No problems at all. Sound quality is also impressive. Also bass can be adjusted as per need",5
Super sound effects. Value for money. Nice FM radio,5
Worst thing ever in this segment.... Too poor sound quality instead of Sony 80w home theater,1
Sound quality is good but we can't change bass because bass change option not available. Overall good product below three thousand range.,3
This product is amazing sounds like car music system amazing base 8000pmpo crystal clear speakers...

** there is auto bass control. when you increase the volume the base adjust automatically",4
"Great speaker value for money
Bass is little bit low but it doesn't matter for me as i am using it in my tv .

"For Bass lovers, 8085b is a good choice. Mid and high is not at all remarkable. You'l get a key for Bass in remote. Adjust bass in a moderate position and make high frequency odible.
Display is not present, even for volume controls, never mind, it is not a Chinese piece.",5
Excellent,5
it was physically damaged,2
"Really disappointed with the overall performance. The speaker has enough volume to fill a room size 15x15. Bass is ok and it can produce frequency at 25Hz! But its signal to noise ratio is only >60db (Shows in its user manual) and the clarity (vocal and high frequency) is not good. Even Creative's A255 can have a better sound quality. It ha bluetooth, sd card, FM .. ok. But I think Sony D9 is more better than this one. The speaker wires are too short and you cannot place the on floor; or you have to cut and extend the speaker wires. FM reception is good and remote control is nice.",3
Full value of your hard earned money..,5

Just purchased from offline store @ 6500 amazon asking much money for this product..well apart from price speakers are too good with clear sound and bass..just one thing it doesnt have more treble ...dats y given 4 stars,4
Excellent speakers due to bass bcz when i played them my room was shaking and vibrating...bass lovers go for it...but if u want a speaker with more crystal clear and sharp sound go for sony srs d9... so i would rather give 4 stars....otherwise no other complaint...all features works correctly... usb bluetooth fm aux and it also has cd player connectivity separately with source setting separately...!!,4

"These are best speakers I currently have at this price range.I first checked it's review on Amazon, on YouTube Everyone saying it's good or best but when I actually listen them, I feel so good to have these in this price range. These are beast if you connect them with Bluetooth.Not good with aux.",5
"Sound quality is ok. Bass/treble is balanced but not extraordinary.
My flip 2 sounds louder than these. Other features are also ok.
But loudness is very sub standard for a 4.1 setup. (I tried aux, bt, pendrive with multiple songs.)",2
"I brought for 2k,its worth more than that!",5
"Best woofer at these price range.got it for 2300 bucks.awesome bass, mind blowing sound.i would recommend to go for these ones.phillips Sony can never provide such quality at these price range......thank u zebronics :). The sound shakes my room that also with half volume.if I do full volume neighborhood will complain hahaha.works fine with my PC.....and I use Bluetooth to listen also",5
"I purchased it after looking at so many positive reviews. This product is a sheer disappointment due to the following reasons:
1>No Bass controll
2>At its 100% volume gives lesser sound than the amount produced at 40~50% by my LG TV.
3>Sound doesn‚Äôt feel like coming from a an external loud speaker(Poor quality sound).
Ultimately you would purchase external speakers because you need louder sound. This does not do justice in that department.

There are few good aspects as well:
1> Blue tooth pairing is not an issue. Connects well across vaious devices.",1
Defective piece received on great indian festival. I have purchase 2 speaker on this occasion and both product are defective. I think they are selling reused product on these type of featival offer. Very bad experience. I have purchase so many things with amazon but this time i m disappointed.,1
"I was really confused as to what to buy, then my father advised me to go for this as he is an engineer and knows in and out of electronics, I ordered it. When I switched it on, I paired it with my mobile and played some songs but the sound was really low, even from the knob available on the main woofer didn't increase much sound. After reading the manual I got to know about volume increase from remote and from the next button on the main woofer. Once you increase the volume from the remote or ""Next"" button on main woofer you'll be amazed with the sound and bass.
PS: Also there's one hidden setting, you have to attach the USB and change to USB mode and then you can even select the different settings from remote like ""Pop"",""Classic"" etc for different sound effects",5
"BT status doesn't give Bluetooth connectivity. Bluetooth not functional.

Make and body finish of the product is not up to the mark.

Woofer body was broken as added in the pics due to which it only kinda hangs out.

Sub sounding do necessarily require the speaker set else standalone woofer is useless.

Since am not at all satisfied with the product wanted to return but shows only replace. On calling Customer care they said to replace the product, if the quality is not up to the mark it will be considered for return. (Headache for the long process.. No value to the Advertising saying of no question asked returns)

Expecting the similar material and body make for the replaced product to be returned.",1

Quality is awsome for this price..
I got it for 2599...

The only drawback i felt is that there is no provision to adjust bass and treble seperately...

Otherwise mindblowing...",4

"I am an user of Onkyo systems for years. Was sceptical about buying zebronics, but the sound quality exceeded my expectations, superb sound quality to fill up the room, boomy bass, Sound is good for 75% of volume, beyond that it looses quality. Good for a small room for laptop, Bluetooth connectivity is very good.",5
Okay product but my honest review is to go for another one coz it makes a loud hiss sound when the equipment is plugged in and not in use .. The noise become un-bearable after few hours coz it gets amplified,3

 I would say this product is the best at this price, I am totally satisfied with everything related to this product.

"My favorite brand longingly to buy since 1997, when I first saw Zebratronic sytems in Mumbai exhibition stall at BKC. I have used other brand systems but didn't get satisfaction. With affordable price. Atlast I bought this system last week from Amazon at 2999 without any deal. Very powerful sound, every thing perfect. Only thing I wanted in this system was wireless speakers and 5.1 Dolby . For 10x15 room 60watt out is sufficient. I hope the manufacturer will upgrade the model to above mentioned suggestions with affordable price.",5
I'm giving 5 star because it's a beautiful product. Very nice sound quality. Awesome bass. Full rock sound. It's amazing. Zebronics gives fantastic products. Beautiful Design. Value of money. Every one should buy this. I recommend this product to everyone who needs a good sound system.,5
Bass is superb. Sound quality is very fine and this sound is pleasant to hear. In this rate it is the best brand. But wires provided to speakers are less length which is not useful for keeping all speakers around room edges,5
"I bought these on my birthday.
Delivered exactly on date.

Nice speakers.
Love them.
Good sound, loud enough for a jam session.
Breathing RGB LED.

Small chords for surround, so basically I cut the chords and tape normal wire to it.
Now there's one speaker at the end of the room in each corner, while the woofer sits beneath TV.
Cinema experience...üòâ",5
"I am writing this review after using the speakers for 2 years. It is one of the best buys in audio system.
Sound quality is good. Bass is preset but it is perfect so not to worry on same.Sound will not distort even when volume is full. Bluetooth connectivity is good and it auto connects when connected with device.remote access is still working perfect. Bestt buy in this range.",5
"If u are using it with smartphone , it won't get that loud or won't be very clear , but once connected to pc , this becomes a beast , volume goes very high as compared to smartphone as well as clarity and balance of the sound , u can increase the quality of output even further by tweaking some window's sound settings.",5
Great sound quality.. Bass is low but sound quality is awesome. Bluetooth connection is quick. Also looks great.. Smooth delivery by Amazon,5
"The speakers have very good sound quality. The remote works for a long time. The battery consumption is less. The Bluetooth connects without any problem to any phone/laptop.
I would like more controls but unfortunately, there are no controls for bass and treble. It has only one setting for these, but it is good.

The service:
The service was amazing as always, the item was delivered timely in perfect condition.",5
Fully satisfied...Nice bass and treble ..Just awwsome....somtimes feel missing the bass switch to control the bass ! The best home theater under rs.2600...Average brand with best deal ....,5
"Very nice sounds... Nonetheless, I got 1 damaged speaker at first... Replaced and got a perfect one finally! Thanks Amazon!",5
Product is nice.Sound quality is too good.. But sometimes it looses it's Bluetooth connection.Look is very brilliant.It will obviously give you a small threatre feelings.It doesn't tells you that your Bluetooth is connected as compared to other types.But overall review is good .And don't push the speaker dust Cap .keep away from kids,5
"Awesome Product By Zebronics and Amazon Sound Quality is Superb Loudness is Average But Bass is More Than i Expected. Overall its a Best and Value for Money Product under 3000 rupees. Go for it Blindly. I Brought it for 2,299 rupees in Amazon special price drop offer.",5
I just loved this product at 2K. It's an awesome buy at this price. Look wise very good... Loved the finish n highlight was changing colors. Very easy to connect n use. Manual given along doesn't give a detailed information though. The quality of sounds also gr8. Even at volume 8-10 gives a high sound. Easily plays music from my mobile phone via Bluetooth. Remote given is decedent.,4
"1) It was delivered before one day, than it was expected.

2) If Indian products are so nice and awesome why we should go with other products. It is really very nice. Sound is awesome. At this price range this is the best. Truely speaking just got for it.. Everything is perfect.
3) The sound is clear.
4) Quality is good and led is very attractive.
5) Bass is also good.
Infact, everything is better than expected.
6) There is a space for improvement in the wires, it would be a bit long.

Thanks Zebronics (Proud to use products made in India)",5
Best in this price range ...superb base quality ..i think this is the best home thetere in market in this price range ..sufficent sound for atlest 50 feets...good job Amazon..thnq so much .....delivered before 4 days before delivery date ...,5
Very good product at this price level and not complain. Good packing and delivered on time. Decent output for a big hall. Suitable for home and office. Well designed with all cables including a remote control.,5
"I bought this product in June 2020, but just after a month 2 of the audio output ports stopped working.
Now I am managing with the remaining 2 ports.
Although the sound quality, Bass , Woofers are really good. The only issue is with the quality of RCA ports, which are of very cheap quality.
Also, it shows 1 Year warranty but customer has to visit the service center, and sadly there is only 1 in entire Bangalore city, which is too far to travel.
To summarize, I wouldn't recommend, as buying this product is just a LUCK, as how long it will sustain has not guaranty.",1
Surround sound is working... but with AV cable.. not expect too much!,5
"I like this 4.1 channel speaker. Bass was superb quality . I LIKE ITü§™
BUT RGB light is not soo good.
Under this value the speaker was superb and good quality üíò

"I bought this product in Amazon great Indian festival @1999/- , awesome product in this price range, sound quality is good but No bass controller",5
Very good speakers at its price range. I bought it for 1200 rupees. Only problem I feel is no bass and treble adjustment.,5
I'm happy with this product and the sound quality..!! ‚ù§Ô∏è,5
We cant turn off the led light but it looks good. Sound Quality and bass is dope!,5

It is an average product. Cost less than what it delivers. Bought it when I was short of cash and got more than what I paid for. Everything part and component worked as specified.,5
Bass is good.bluetooth connectivity is so fast and sound quality super from mobilr. working great with my led tv with cable. Great product in this price range,5
Excellent,5
Very happy with the product. Value for money. Fulfills a basic poor man's home theatre. Have not found any issues. Except that a minor fine tune with how device works would have helped. Every time the product is switched on the volume plays at highest and you bring it back down every time. Which will be annoying,5
"I purchased to this just 10 ago.
Sound quality is very good.
Looks wise very smart.
Light weight eaasy to carry.",5
Good product.after one week of use 1aux(led TV output) 4/5.2 FM 4/5 3 bt 4/5. USB 4.5/5 good sound quality& bass for this price. Speakers build quality sturdy(wooden).remode is good.

I bought it in 2018. Still works very well. Sound quality is also very good. It is a good product in this price range. Remote controller is still working! That is a very good thing. Even remote controllers of big brands are not so long lasting. If you are a bass lover definitely it is worth buying. Remember one thing it is not an extra ordinary product. You will get a nice product in reasonable price.,4
Good product,5
This product has amazing 'sound Quality' nd the volume control is verry good.... And it connects... Very fast....,5

Awesome sound quality, bass is too good. I good this at 3k which is way too cheap for a product with such a nice quality. Budget friendly and quality product. Too satisfied!",5
Good music system sound quality is good volume control is good Bluetooth connectivity is good overall price is good thanks zebronice,5

Awsm sound quality n bass is also great . Go for it you will not regret for your spending,5
This is a very good product in this price range. I was looking for some less cost speakers but I got a home theater. I highly recommend the zebronics speakers.,5
If your budget is low as me. Go for this product and you will be amazed to hear the sound quality. Got it for 2200 and best using it from 2 years. Now planning to go for zebronics again for an expensive product.,5
Bass is not that good. But over all it‚Äôs a good product. Go for it,5
Descent product,5

Don't hesitate you can go for it. It's a.quality product from Zebronics. Thank you!! üòä",5
"Sound is great but bass is just gud. Product is ok. You can't change bass and treble from main deck. And also there is no equalizer settings for aux. Equalizer will work only in USB and MMC. Sound output is above average. Good product quality. Dancing LED on main deck is attractive.
Delivery from Amazon is on time. Took another 1 day for delivery after they promised. With bluetooth we can modify the audio with punchy bass and less vocal or instrumentals. The 4 inch bass box surprises you in 80% of volume but at higher volumes it can't reach the peps.",5
"Superb sound quality üî•üî•üëå .
I loved it very much.Thank u Amazon",5
Value for money üí∞,5
In this price i brought a small jbl Bluetooth speaker which is no where comparable to this bass monster..,5

"Best product. Awesome thumping and clear bass. Only con is that bass control is not there, but you can use your PC or mobile equiliser to control bass. Close your eyes and buy. Definitely value for money.",5
The best choice among 5.1 sound system within the Budget for Crispy sound and a great Bass. Love it.,5

It's ok for small size room. Sounds quality is OK in this price segment.,5
"Super awesome Speaker

Awesome product. The bass is coming like a killer. The sound quality is also very nice. Only one thing is missing that is the bass controller but the sound is very balanced with the bass limit. So i am not going to miss the thing.,5
Superb product in this price range.Seperate Bass and treble control is missing.Only volume control.Nice bulid quality and premium loook.,5
"As in user guide given not to use USB slot for charging any electronic devices,ignore that warning and tried to charge my phone,after few minutes the main unit starts heating up and gives burning smell.
But till now there is no problem!!",5
Almost 2 years n no complains yet.. Working smoothly.. Compact n beautiful.. Beautiful music.. Had a complain immediately after delivery.. N amazon replaced a new one.. Thank you for considering..,5
Everything is good but the wires.must be given a more.length,5
classy system.... 1st time received without remote but thanks 2 amazon replaced old into new,5
"Zebronics products are use and throw, they are VFM. Have decent performance, good till they last and reasonably priced.

But they last only for a few months post warranty expiry.
This is my second such experience, I bought this in July 2017and this one's gone in may1029.
Earlier I had zebronics Bluetooth handy speaker and that too died after 1.5yrs...

Enjoy till it lasts",2
Excellent product sound is okey bluetooth connectivity is good but bass is not up the mark,5
"Great product, noise is sufficient to home . Radio,aux , speaker are good .best bass are given",5
Happy with the purchase.Clear loud sound. Good Bluetooth connectivity. Looks also good. I recommend it.Thanks,5
Good sound for 10x12 room size.,5
"I liked the sound quality
But there is no any button for bass control
With BT connectivity the sound is more
The aux cable and satellite wires are small size
My aux cable is damaged",5
Good product,5
"As usual, I read all the reviews, both positive and negative before buying this. But thought of trying my luck as I believe in Zebronics products. quick delivery by Amazon. overall great performance at this price range. Bass and Treble are good. bluetooth is working even through abstacles and the phone is not in straight line with speakers (tested from other room). Volume is sufficient enough for 2 BHK flat. Remote is working well. They are providing remote without batteries, we need to buy them seperately. There is No Bass control, which is something negative I can say.",5
IT WAS AWESOME AND SOUNDS INCREDIBLE..,5
These speakers and really worth every penny spent. Sound quality is amazing and they connect literally in no time. Amazing product.,5
"I like this product sound quality and bass is ok because what you want in ‚Çπ3,000.Almost this product is best in this budget.",5

"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Good sound",5
"Very fast delivery
Sound quality is very best......over all everything is best....thanks amazon",5
"I am not really satisfied with the product, but it costed me only 2300 bucks I can't be too harsh on this. Actually it is quite good for listening music but of your re watching a video or a movie, vocals aren't very clear, words are just muffled and your are not able to understand the dailouges. Mostly it is due to the subwoofer, as the bass can't be turned off it just keeps beating even when bot needed and that destorys the vocals.
Bass is really good though, real treat for bass lovers. But wierd thing is, it just starts beating anywhere, sometimes in really sad scenes üòÇüòÇ.

There is also some problem with Bluetooth, it disconnects and reconnects automatically while playing (but this is just problem with my unit).

But you won't get a better speaker for this price, so if you have a tight budget go for it.

Reviews after 4 months of use ‚ò∫Ô∏è",3
"Superb Bass and Sound Quality

I have ordered this second time for my other residence after using over 3 months. Best product at this price. Sound quality is too good. Volume control and loudness is high enough to play for household parties and get-together.,5
It works like normal average music system with average base and sound quality. But it is great at this price. Works fine..,5
"If you are looking for good quality speakers and whooper, then just go with this one. The sound quality is super awesome, this set can turn your home into a dance floor very easily and very  Zebronics BT4440RUCF 4.1 Channel Bluetooth Speakers quickly too",5

Awsome speakers since 7months speakers working super. Blindly go for it this price range.,5
"I got this for 2300 and it's worth paying it. Best speakers under 2500. Just go for it. But their was little crack at the back side of my remote, but it's ok. The speaker was delivered in the company box only, Amazon didn't package it. Otherwise it was ok.",5
Too good in this price ...,5
"I buy it for 2k, its worth more than that!
Sound quality is good.

Phillips, Sony never provide such quality at these price range.",5
"Every features in this is awesome, Bluetooth connectivity is good and it is worth for my money.",5
"Sounds good.
Adequate bass.
Treble was good and not distorted.
Fm radio works just fine.
Overall value for money!",5
I have been using this for 2 days and the performance is just mind-blowing. This is perfect for a small room. The Bass is just quite a lovely throw. Bluetooth streaming is good too. If u need a System which can stream with 2.5K budget then u can go ahead without any hassles. Lot of pros but just to mention it doesn't have a Bass Controller but has EQ which can be controlled.,5
"Bought it on 4/10/2017. Writting this review after 3 years (i,e.17/10/2020) üòÅ. Just to appreciate the Zebronics product quality at an affordable price.
About the home theatre,
Good sound quality. I only use this to listen music through bluetooth. Bluetooth range is only around 15feet. Base is good.
Good for 10*15 room. ( I tried this with led t.v , it worked pretty good).
Overall worth the price.( I came across this product on Great Indian sale, I'm writing this review to help whoever planning to buy this)",4
Awesome bass and sound clarity is very nice and worthy for money,5
I liked the product it has wonderful sound quality. I liked especially it's Bluetooth support. The only problem is that it does not offer to change the bass according to requirements. But overall i loved the speakers,5
"DO NOT BUY THIS if looking for a home theatre.
THERE IS NO REFUND POLICY ON THIS PRODUCT. You can replacement BUT CANNOT RETURN.
NO BASS at all. Music volume is okay
It's a typical computer speakers, good for listening music if you are connecting through a PC or a laptop.",2
"Sound quality is great. There is no bass control so you cannot set bass to high or low. All you can set is the master volume.
Bluetooth connectivity is decent. You can play music from your phone using BT option.
Earlier the item delivered had issues and sound and bass was really bad. So if you get such a delivery please ask for replacement as it would be a defective piece. The item delivered as replacement was good and the sound is really nice and bass is also decent. Overall it's a good product in this price range and good for home usage.
Radio is also good has good antenna, just that setting and saving the channel is a task.
Can connect to computer but the cable provided with the box to connect the woofer to the CPU is really small.
Overall the product is great and the sound is very clear and you would love to listen to the songs on this system. Connect your phone and enjoy the songs.",4
It's awesome...I'm using if for 2 years and it's really awesome...not a single problem yet.. worth the price,5
"It's been 5 years and the speaker is still working fine. I was not sure to buy this one because I was not sure of the brand. However after using this product almost everyday, from the time it was delivered; I would definitely recommend it to everyone. The sound quality and base is also more than enough at this price range. The only issue is that they have a volume controler but no base controller...",5
"Zebronics 4.1 audio system is very good product in its class. Excellent sound quality. The major defect i found is with FM receiver. No clarity in FM.Very poor reception. I live in city area with more than 5 FM station reception. Another defect is lack Trible - Bass controller in base set and in remote. The FM reception problem was already i faced with another Zebronics product in another locality. So i think the zebronics authorities should should address the issue immediately for their products. Apart from that this product is excellent and worth for money you spent.
Also this time i got this product delivered by INDIA POST and not say a pathetic delivery experience with lack of packing, careless handling, packet opened and worst behavior.",4
I bought for 2567Rs when USB mode sound basse awesome for price aux and. Bluetooth sounds low,5
Tooo good product really I can't believe it really sounds good unbelievable product in this price we can easily buy this product with out any doubt,5
It looks sleek and it works good. sound clarity is good. using it at a commercial place and it serves the purpose. nice product. go for it.,5
"Superb purchased, Easy to connect to the Bluetooth,aux and led TV's , very good bass, and led colour lighting",5
just go for it..if your bauzet is low for music system or supporting TV sound theater ...really good...,5
"Good product
Sound is awesome
But bass adjuster is not available",5
Display not showing and also not working audio system. Bluetooth device not working.,5
"Over all I am happy with the sound quality, you only get what you pay for so that way it‚Äôs value for money. But the buttons on the woofer doesn‚Äôt work properly you have to try multiple times also batteries not included for the remote, not a deal breaker but it has become a common custom to include batteries as part of your purchase.",4
"Awesome product
I really like it ,
Good for one who is having limited budget",5
Sound clarity is damn good,5
Best product at this price. The subwoofer is very powerful. The sound quality is also good.,5
"Product is ok. You can't change bass and treble from main deck. And also there is no equalizer settings for aux. Equalizer will work only in USB and MMC. Sound output is above average. Good product quality. Dancing LED on main deck is attractive.
Delivery from Amazon is worst. Took another 2 days for delivery after they promised.",3
Very good produced,5
"The two accessories are missing. About the sound quality, center speaker's performance is not good as there is some external buzzing sound when the volume increases. The box is also broken, it maybe during the shipping. It's better to take some measures during the packing in order to avoid breaking during shipping.",1
"Remote broken condition otherwise over all good
Please check before packing",5
Supbb üëåüëå,5
"This is one of the best music system for home use.. boss is little much low and not controlled by us it's in constent position..over all the sound clarity is very good and this price range you will get everything like Bluetooth,USB, Memory card, Aux don't think too much just go for this.",4
"Still my product is not receive
I am replacement my order because
Before product not working",5
It is very good product. Sound quality is very good. Must buy speakers list ..,5
all are okay..but the most important thing is there are one speaker may be not working... i am not sure about that.....let's see ...,5
"Under 3k,it's nice product.sound quality it's so good and handy product.",5
Very good product at this price good for small room.,5
The connecting wires from the woofer to speakers must have been a little longer. 4m atleast,5
"This is really not a good product. There may be 2 reasons either the quality compromised or a fake product received.
First one was handled badly by courier partner. Sir there are too many dents. On woofer body also sleeker are dented in front.
Second which I have received after 4 days stopped working. There is no display only getting sound of switch on and switch off.
Really very baad experience with this shopping.
Thank you now will return today to courier partner.",1
"A great product for the price. Does it's job pretty well. Bass is isn't that loud and thumping but that's acceptable for the price. Got it for Rs2300! Loudness is great (60W RMS). VOCALS are great. Its easy to use, bit less durable but sound is amazing. The remote I received was cracked and the packaging by the seller wasn't good. I have already given a feedback regarding this to the seller. The system however managed to get delivered in working condition.
To sum up, it's a great system that would fulfill your most demands. Remember, it's a budget music system.",4
"Initially I got a product where the remote was not working then exchanged it. The exchange time is very quick and really appreciate Amazon for this.
About the product... Sound quality is good. Worth for money.",5
"I am writing this review after using it for 4 months. Based on my experience initially, I had returned this thinking this as defective but second unit was same again.

What is good?
1. Sound is really very loud for playing indoor.
2. A good product at this price range.

What can be improved?
1. Bluetooth connectivity and connection strength. Signal drops and it feels you are streaming something with slow internet.
2. When power cuts, it by default resets to maximum volume.
3. Sound has distortion while playing at maximum volume.
4. Aux cable is just 1 meter.
5. Sound quality is better on BT than aux cable though it should be same.
6. Remote doesn't work even at the distance of 4-5 meter. You need to go very close to the speaker.

Should I buy this?
Yes, if you have budget constraints and can't invest additional 2-3K. Buying this product at 3K is not a bad deal.

Bottom line:
Add 2K more in your budget and go for another product for better sound experience.",3
"Sound quality great, bluetooth connectivity is average but manageable if there is no obstacles in between.
I will say one thing for this price it is best. Vocal and bass are balanced. You will not feel any distortion even when volume is high. So if any one willing to purchase in this price range, simply go for it. You will not regret.",4
Good product and good quality of product and excellent quality???,5
"I wanted to give 4.5 *.
Excellent product in this price. Only remote control is not powerful. You have to use remote in specific direction. Except remot's power, it is extremely good product. Delivery was very fast.",5
"I am using it from 2 weeks and i felt that the item is worth buying from bass quality to the loudness all things arw excdllent. What i felt quite negative is its wires, the wires seems too thin to provide more flexibility but on the same it seems quite weak. So, anyways thumbs up for this item a very good purchase that i made so far",4
"Bhai aakh band kar ke le le is price me sabse mast home theater hai
Bhai full aawaj me v bajane se kuch nhi hota aur mai apne home theatre ko sam ke 6 baje se 9 baje tak full aawaj me daily bajata hu fir v mast work kar raha hai
Nice... Product
Thanx Amazon",5
Sound quality and Bluetooth speaker very good üëç,5
"Writing review after using for a month. I am fully satisfied with the performance at this price range. Sound quality is excellent, bluetooth connectivity is also good except on a few occasions, have to connect manually with TV else it connects automatically when TV is 0pp plugged on. Range is quite excellent, it works when sitting in different room.",4
"It's a good product for those just would like to have a speakers set 4.1 for listening to music through BT, Sd, usb AUX and FM.. bass is less.. but it's not my purpose.. just listen to favorite songs and FM",5
"Very low sound quality!
'BASS' & 'TREBLE' quality is very low standard!
Sound 'CLARTY' also not good!
There is no separate control for 'BASS' & 'TREBLE'.!
Only it's can play with loud volume but you won't feel like 'Home Theater' .!!
---------
Now within two months.. RL speaker connection from Woofer STOP working!!",1
I received my package on 7 January 2019 after ordering on 6 January 2019. I like the speaker and sound and everything is good. But when I looked at the remote it was broken. The photo is proof. I bought the item from Appario Retail Private Ltd. I don't have the time or energy for replacement so I have to live with it. Please be careful while buying this product.,3
"West quality & west sound, Hi-Fi Bluetooth connectivity, waste volume",5
"No bass control. Volume control is so messed up when connected through Bluetooth. Aux at high volume gives out a humming noise.
LR and RR speakers stopped working in 6 months. Even after service center repaired it, the same issue occasionally pops up.

I fitted the RL and RR speakers at the corners of my room using good quality RCA cable extenders. But the sound coming out is those two is very low. Also note that these are not surround speakers.

The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is due to its low price point.",3
The overall system is average.... Sounds and bass are also average.... Bt the delivery system are poor... The men who deliver this to me this morning are so careless.... The stored this system very carelessly.. As a result the remote broke up..... Bt not fully damaged its working after I install batteries in this.... One more drawback is that they don't provide battery for the remote... Other wise it's good under this range.... Better than expected.... I was very confused to buy music system.... After many research I found this one.. Hopping will fulfill the expectations... And it does...... If you are also willing to have a home theatre under 2.5k... You can go with it... Surely it will stand on your expectations.... Bt the delivery men should be careful....... Thnks,4
This is the best one comparing to money,5
Very good device at the price. I paid ‚Çπ2999 for it. Looks stylish with the design and lights. Bass output is quite good. The voice is not that clear. Will be very useful if you want to listen to hard music. Not so useful for watching daily soap on tv.,4
Sounds super,5
Very nice product with higher sound But without satellite speakers it sound is low and sound is not clear üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüî•üî•üî•,5
Impressed me....4.1 is powerful and all functions work perfect....bass is pretty amazing...and beautiful design and built quality...led is also okay... decent and best,5
"Surprisingly stopped working on 1st day only. Can't believe Amazon is selling all faulty products. Bellow avarage product, sound quality is acceptable but the volume control is a complete disaster. Quality of the plugs and wires are terrible. Bluetooth connectivity is old version but still works. My suggestion would be invest a little more and get atleast brands like Phillips or Sony.",1
"Got it for 2499 during Independence day sale.
Amazon took 8 days to dispatch it and delivered it the 10th day (worst delivery experience till date.)
The product came in the original Zebronics packaging.
The sound quality was OK.
I would say OK because it was not very good as a 4.1 channel speaker should be.

Pros:
RGB lights look beautiful.
Bluetooth connectivity is good.
The sound is loud enough.
The speaker's cable length is more than 1mtr each.

Cons.
The woofer doesn't have a bass controller.
There were no batteries for the remote.
The small speaker's sound is not loud enough hence the bass overtakes the trebles.

Now the problem begins
I was not satisfied by the quality so I decided to return it and optend for a refund.
The pickup date was 5 days late so I thought I can listen till the pickup date.
BUT the speaker stopped working the same day while listening to music.
Only the RGB lights were on, the display / indicator didn't even turn on again.
That was a DEFECTIVE ITEM.",3
Nice product for the price... Actually using it for a month. No problem so far. The sound quality is good not great and the look too... It's sad that there is no knob to control bass and treble... The sub woofer itself is not pumbing enough bass... The FnD 2.1 I had earlier was producing more thumbing bass than these ones... Another downside is the aux input... its terrible! Don't know whether its with the cable or the system... Bluetooth is working fine.. i would say the sound quality is better when connected via Bluetooth... The system could have included a memory function so that every time when we switch on the system It goes to the previously used input.... Unfortunately its going to aux input every time we switch on the system.... Remote included is pretty good... Usb/sd input is working fine but the Radio is not working for me... I have tried a lot of time but not getting any channels. Overall an avg speaker system producing a good sound with below avg bass....,3
"This is very small,not like what you in pic, like the ones you got earlier with your desktop PC. Sound quality, not good,looks wise cheap, speakers not proper working, in aux mode, only two rt speakers work.no on off from front. Highly overpriced, low in quality and performance. You cannot return it, you to bear with it and repent over it , thanks to Amazon.",2
"Best budget speaker, good packaging by Amazon. Timely delivery. Decent bass and sound clarity good.",5
Worthable product in zebronics just 2500 ... Sounds quality's very good ... Bass ultimate ...,5
Best Sound quality,5
"Previous speaker where faulty. Non of the port cable we're fitting properly. Thus asked for replacement. The replacement arrived in just 2 days. Thanks to Amazon for super fast delivery.
I am happy with my 2nd parcle. The speaker where in good condition.. working well..good sound and bass.. overall value to money.

Deducting 2 star for sending defauled speaker.. else would have given 5 stars.",3
"Wow.. Excellent Bass, Sound Quality Also Good.. This is 5star rating item Fr9m Zebronics..",5
Excellent,5
Bad,5
"The packaging and build quality is good. The colour lights seems like an aberration, since I am trying to watch movie in dark room. The sound quality is below par. The dialogue is not clear, even with good audio stream like from a fire stick. I verified the audio works well in other systems for the same video. The digital display is avg. It displays input mode and volume. All the 4 speakers have same length cord. I feel the back speakers should have longer cord.
Over all it is a very average product at affordable price.",3
"Medium range speaker with Bluetooth feature; for a good price. Loved it . Quick delivery too . Thanks AmaZon
I bought it a year back and it still works fine .",5
Worth it,5
"1. I am not a audio nerd by any standards. For me its sounds about right for what I expected.
2. I mainly use it while watching movies in home theater projector. Connected directly through the 3.5mm Jack.
3. Also used to hear FM station, which it had no trouble picking up.
4. Remote works well and the led light is also good.",4
Nice looking speaker and nice sounds and bass loud sound very powerful sound thanks to sellers and amazon,5

"At first I say delivery boy is very good.
Next come back to the main point
Zebronics BT4440RUCF 4.1 C is OK (not good) product on this mony.
When I collected this package and opened it and set up for music I noticed that one speaker doesn't work.",4
Speaker is awesome but started making humming/buzzing sound from all the four speakers. Customer Support is very bad. They don't have troubleshooting techniques and the service center is just want to make money. I would not recommend this product.,1
"Good product but, plz check them finally inspections.",5
"All good, like sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity is so quick.",5
SD card not supported 36 GB of video,5

Mind blowing product mind blowing sounds base everything loved it worth buying it smart look good Bluetooth connectivity loved it,5
"Poor quality product!!!
Don't buy it!!!
Total waste of money!!!
The woofer stopped working after 15 days of purchase,bluetooth doesn't work.
Just the woofer light turns on when plugged in.
There's no information anywhere about where to get it fixed from even though the product has one year warranty.
What is use of this warranty I wonder.
I don't think there's anyone to solve and look into this matter.

Highly disappointed.",1
"Good product . Bass control is automatic, not much feel the bass but you never expected the bass quality at this price. If you are a bass lover then this one is not met with your expectation.",4

Awesome product from zebronics......it's working amazingly...I have been using it since past 3 months it's working very good with no issues.....I suggest you to take this product it your budget is below 3000...!!,5
"The sound quality is ok, a minute after I plugged it has a very bad noise even in stand by mode then I thought it has some defect and replaced it with amazon the service from amazon is quite good and impressive a 2nd day I got the replace by another. But surprised me the 2nd one also the same problem IS IT NORMAL? or I got bad luck? twice.",1
Very good,5
Offers excellent sound quality for the price. The bass improves as you use the product. Good overall product.,5
Good,5
"Good speaker. Provides reasonable bass and treble. Only problem is the volume, when switched on. The volume automatically goes to full when you switch on. It does not save the volume that is set. If your volume controller from other device such as firestick is already high, then when switched on you will get a unbearable huge sound output all of a sudden which is pathetic.",4
"Very Good product,",5
This product is very good.,5

Best 4.1 home theater speaker sound quality is excellent but bass is average bluetooth connectivity is very good remote quality is below average everything is fine but not for hall purpose worth for money üëç,4
"When I press the input mode change buttons on speaker or the remote there are only three options
AUX, Bluetooth and FM.. but no option for USB and SD card selection. So even if there is ports for USB and SD cards no option to select it.
Is anyone there facing the same problem?",2

I'm enjoying it.
‚ò∫",4
Sure you won't get anything better than this in this price. I'm loving the sound.,5
"While this is a good value for money system. It has some shortcomings.

a) Expected at least a bass increase decrease knob. A good system has two knobs to change bass and treble.
b) Sounds bit low for such a 4 box system.",3
This product is awesome I like this product,5
God to buy,5
"Good sound quality, axe cable connection sound is normal, Bluetooth sound effect is good",4
I am writing this after 3 years of purchase. Overall performance is good the connectivity of bluetooth is a bit low it's around 5-6 meter.,4
"Not good for instrumental, different instrument sounds blend together and are not heard distinctly. sound distribution amoungst the speakers can be better, good base,EDM and rap sounds good besides disturbances at max volume (30) plays ok at 27-28. Can probably last 7 to 8 months if use with care(not sure just a prediction let's hope for the best(may later up to a year))
WORTH THE MONEY.
NOT FOR INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.",4
Ok for small room not for big party looks good i am using for movies and ps4 games,4

Value for money,5
very good,5
Superb speaker üîä,5
my buy price is 2k best product sound quality good at this price 4.1 with Bluetooth and remote control,5
The product is not satisfactory. It is a waste of money. The support team & SM team from Amazon does not even want to help..not even the leadership. They just read out the policies that the product will be replaced but it will not be refunded. What will anyone do with a replacement when they are not happy with the product..,1
It's an amazing product but the one thing lack is bass control its poor. At this price range it could have given better features . Atleast the bass should be powerful. But that the worst thing. Don't buy if you are bass lover. I love when everything near me vibrate it feels out of universe overall it's ok ok.,2
Very good sound quality glorry finished and the led light awesome,5
Vera level,5
"Sound quality is best bass are good but no bass control are available in remote. Build quality is best. Finally best subwoofer & satellite speakers .

Y you are not taking any responsibility and actions I want to be exchanged this product if you are not given me new pis then I'll be going to consumer court ok,5
I like this home theatre very much. But i dislike that the remote is manufactured as the can be rise upto 30. But in speaker there is volume option which you can rise ahigher level of sound,5
Nice one for a room. Good bass. Worth for money. Fully satisfied in this price range as a music and movie sounds lover,5
Good Sound quality and surrounding. But sometimes it gets automatically disconnected from Bluetooth and have to connect it again.,4
Looking beautiful but sound quality is not so strong just average but value for money. Overall good product.,4
"It's amazing good woofer effect and good connectivity for Bluetooth, aux,usb, FM I'm also referred my friends good bass sound best price, best effect best connectivity I like zebronic speaker system",5
Very good sound output and overall worth buy,5
Happy to get this sound system in this price. Looks and finish is brilliant. Sound quality is good although not massive sound is generated. Smooth operation. Only thing that is missing is the manual bass/treble equaliser. The delivery by Amazon was a bit delayed due to dussehra. Overall I'm happy with this. üòÑ,4
It looks good. Vibrating lights. Moderate Amplifier. A bit expensive. The only cons is less volume than what was expected from in this price range.,4
"Its awesome...but sometimes when we connect bluetooth with mobile, it's disturbing and got struck like ghar ghar sound.
Some times it is getting disconnect automatically when we pause the song.",4
These are the best bluetooth speakers in this price range excellent bass and good bluetooth range. Got these @2099!! Thank u amazon,5

Bass 9/10 (no bass control knob but it can still be controlled using equalizers in music player apps)
No need to think twice before buying .",5
Delivered all the features as promised. Good product.Sound quality is also good. May be would have been little louder.but overall its all ok. Bluetooth connectivity with remote.Best for domestic use.,4
Today I received this product.thank you Amazon for the lesser price and super fast delivery.i got it at 2099.best speaker under this range. satellite speakers cord must be a little long as it is too short.zebronics must carefull about this.over all product is awesome.,5

"Worked well for a few days but only after a month the display disappeared. No function is working. Its not more than a black box occupying a corner of my room. Waste of money. No column of replacement. What do I do of it now. Cant even be used as a paper weight. terribly disappointed on its choice, should have gone for a better brand.",1
Using it from last 4-5 months. They are loud and clear. Connects well with phone and plays seamlessly. Decent for open air listening or for a small party on roof top.,4

"This 40 watts 4.1 speakers is good. But the sound is not high enough in comparison to Zebronics 27 watts 2.1 sound system.There is no Bass control knob. Digital display became defective within 4 months. I have purchased both 2.1 and 4.1 speakers, but both have the same Digital display problems.Please don't buy it.",3
"at standby mode, it makes an isshing noise which is really annoying, and if you listen carefully the noise stays during the song progression.
maybe I received a defective product (showed after a month of usage), but would not recommend this at this price",3
sound quality is ok bass is not good and if you are buying it for Bluetooth dont buy the worst Bluetooth quality and range i had to buy portable Bluetooth device to make it wireless ok aux go for something els is you want wireless speaker,2
"Satisfied with the product.
Received fresh and new product.
Good sound quality and bass..
Enough for small house and middle class people.
Don't expect bass effect which beats your heart but bass is good enough.
Everything is good.
Cons:
No wallMount Option to. Satellite speakers",4
Amazing Super at lowest price,5
Sound and bass is good as per price .I bought it in 2k. But volume is not that much louder as I expected as 4.1 speakers should be... otherwise it's quite a descent deal.,4
"Worst product. I lost all of my money.
Speakers stopped working suddenly, service center people are saying it is internal wiring spark caused. Can't be replaced or repaired. Product is 4 months old and is under warranty. I have intex speakers running from past 8 years.",1
It's good but the bass not much as expected.,4
"Product is good in this price range.
Sound is best,design is also best. It is very compatible for small home.
Woofer also working good in this price range becoz woofer is not more powerful but compatible for small room if your budget is more and you want more powerful woofer then choose another one but at this range this is the best and class product.",4
"Writing this review after using it for around 5-6 months. The sound quality is really good at this price point, build quality is also good but sometimes it has USB connectivity issue the songs suddenly stops and no bass control everything else is fine, giving it 4 out of 5.",4
Review After 1 year. Paise wasool. Best sound quality . Only problem it doesn't remember last volume setting. Start always with full volume.,5
"Not rating 5 stars because battery cells not provided with remote.
There is no packing box of Amazon.com just wrapped in plastic foil.
Overall sound quality is good as far as price is concerned.
Main supply Wire should have quite long.",4

Its quite good. Bought it a year ago and functioning smoothly till now. However it does not catch radio signal in small cities. Overall the price you spend will worth it.,4
Bass is not up to the mark. Won't recommend anyone. I was planning to buy F&D or Philips but bought this after seeing good reviews. It is OK ok but not up to the mark. Zebronics has a long way to go. Sound clarity is good but bass and beats are terrible.,1
I would like to give it 5 star ... Superb sound n bass is good ... But satellite speakers cables are too short in length .. hardly 1 metre .. and the quality of aux cable is very cheap,3

"Build your own mini home theater. Well, I actually have one but who will hunt for DVDs or write to pen drive these days. I bought this only because of the bluetooth support. You can play songs directly from your smart phones. In VFM, I will give it 5*. Design, 4*. Sound quality, 4*. Some songs like Naina from Dangal sound superb on this. Dance floor songs should be best played at medium volume. High volume doesn't sound good.

"Exquisite Sound experience under 3K friends seriously...!
Awesome music with 4.1 sound production.
Following are supported-
Bluetooth, FM, USB, AUX, SD Card.

Rating:
Bass: 8.5/10
Treble: 9/10
Overall Music: 9/10

A must buy product...

Delivery and Packaging also very good by Amazon.",4
"For the Price this is a compact and clear audio device , there is not BASS adjustment , but its set just perfect, fit for small rooms , Bluetooth pair works well with iphone , one plus 3T , no complaints - have not tested the USB and SD , not sure if I will use it as BT works fine.
Delivered on time without damage - as always with Amazon.

For Small rooms and if not interested in manipulation via equaliser - its worth the money.
If you have small kids you should know that the speakers are all exposed partially , so if they push a pencil or pen on it , they will tear, so either keep it up on a shelf or avoid with Kids below 3-4 yrs",5
"Sound is good and base is more than I expected (not comparing with JBL or Creative though). Using it with my LED TV with HD STB and can experience a better feel than TV's inbuild audio system. it got a fair BT range, but sometimes it make some pairing issues (like device not showing or cannot pair) but rebooting solves it generally. Sound quality in better in BT, USB & SD card slot compared to FM or AUX i/p (that's obvious), initially sound didn't crack in the top volume which is quite high, but after almost 3months of use now i can feel bit cracking of sound in the higher range, that too negotiable. hope it wont increase it time. FM got an antenna that's a great feature but I am not getting a good FM reception may be due to the placement of the product. 1 problem I encountered was the defect in the 7segment display. A part of one of the 4 seven segment displays malfunctioned from the day 1 but I didn't want to change the entire product for this minor problem. Remote is a good option for these type of systems and its remote is good too even it got equalizer option for different genre. Another problem i feel that it does not remember its digital sound settings once its powered off and will start on the maximum possible sound output with respect to the analog sound knob's position. Overall if you are negotiable with these minor flaws and don't expect these 2000bucks speakers to be comparable with that of Bose then you can definitely enjoy action movies on HBO or Star Movies in HD or can enjoy your favorite music over BT/USB/SD. Overall value for money!",3
"So, i write this review after use of 6 days. In this days i use this maximum time to check its performance. I satisfied very much from this product. Little bit issue of radio. Others system performance is very good.",4
"Having used them for 2 years, I was fond of the Intex speakers till last month. But I was blown away with these Zebronics speakers. It's light weight and subtle in design, but the output is amazing. Imagine a bose drum speakers for car, now this gives the exact same effect. It's a steal at this price as it also has bluetooth. I am enjoying the songs on FM as I write this review.
If there is a new version, I would like them to add a better display panel with more information. Also, I miss the manual bass/treble adjustments.",5
"Pros:
- Absolutely awesome sound. Quite powerful bass. Set it up with my TV in the living room and it sounds almost like a Dolby surround theater.
- Aesthetically pleasing. LED lights on the subwoofer is not overdone and would blend in very well in almost all scenarios.

Cons:
- Buttons on the unit are very plastic. Clicks loud and wobbles giving you a reminder of what you payed for it.
- Remote is also low quality and you have to press hard to register.
- FM antenna is super lame (A wire sticking out from the back). Picks up a lot of interference. Cannot leave it alongside other wires on the back, have to tie it upwards somewhere or leave it hanging out from the front to make it useful.
- All the connection wires could have been a bit longer. Power cable being uncomfortably short.

BUT WAIT!
The cons may be more in number than the pros but the quality of sound blows it all off (Literally man the BASS!) . In the end speakers are for listening to your media and frankly this one out does many Sony or Phillips 5-10k systems. Just set it up properly and enjoy the music.
Give it a thumbs up if it helped.
Cheers mate.",4
Overall This product is awesome and has a great sound but if you want to buy it then dont buy under one day delivery in amazon prime. I did so and was delivered a defective piece. First experience with amazon was unforgetable.,1
"The zebronics 4.1 multimedia speaker is a wonderful choice. Iam using it for more than 3 months.If you are a normal user then it's a good deal. I bought this during the lighting deal during the sale and it's really worth for every penny paid.
The Bluetooth features also works very well. However the cable which connects to the CPU is a bit short. Have to adjust accordingly.
As I said if you are a normal user and wants a good sound quality it's an excellent choice. Else we have to go for 5.1 of a good brand.
The customer support by zebronic was also good.
Good delivery by Amazon too.",5
There is no bass and treble controller and bass is not up to the mark but in 2200 rupees the best thing i ever buy,3
"12 September, 2017 ; 15:21
Im happy with this speaker but also very disappointed with this. I was planning to buy sony d100 but due to money problem i can't afford right now.
My friends, this speaker is very good for normal rooms either used in 2bhk. You can feel the bass in another room also.
Im unhappy bcz this speaker doesn't have bass/treble option but you can feel strong bass. And sound is okay for small rooms.
Looks is also good. So purchased 2remote batteries before receiving this speaker. Let's create boom boom boom boom to disturb our neighbours üëäüëäüòÇ",4
"the speakers are good, no doubt.......

i checked 6 diff brands out there comparing - features, sound quality, watts n price. all their prices were way-off... and they didn't have all the features

the only speakers with -> Aux, BT, USB, SD card, FM, Sound quality, 60 Watts, Equalizer mood - for this price is great.!!!!!!...grab it quickly before they increase the price.....i got this for 2600/- on amazon..(very sad)

I would also mention - i am not quiet satisfied with the Bass (8 out 10)",5
"Got at 2299/- For the Price its a Steal! Gives a Good quality audio, Aux , Bluetooth works Flawlessly, Fm. Good Bass and Stellar Clarity expected from a 4.1 Speaker.

Remote works Flawlessly too ..although you have to get the 2 AAA battery by yourself. Dts easily available at a local store

Had an F&D speaker which stopped working after 2 years that too was great but wanted to try something new... So thought about switching to Zebronics.

Made a Small to Medium sized room shake with its sound with correct pacement. Lol

And i am Glad now that I am Fully Satisfied and Happy. I would recommend this to Everyone at this price range of 2- 2.5 k.",5
"Speaker is fabulous. Bluetooth works like charm 10_ 15 m range, usb n fm work fine

I wish option like different music mode can be used in modes other than usb

I heard lot of people complaining about Bass.. let me clearly state that Bass is wonderful and is adequate for large room.. people says that Bass control knob is not present.. this is done purposely so that speaker adjust Bass accordingly and we don't have to worry..

I wish the aux cable and speaker cable would have been longer but that is issue with all electronics..

Got the product @ 2000 /- in great Indian sale",5
"Excellent Product. Decent seller. The first piece I received had a malfunctioning blue-tooth module. But the seller with Amazon's support replaced it promptly. The product is awesome for the price. If you are a user who wants to hear quality music but also respects your neighbor's freedom, then this is your product. If you are looking for a 'blast' and shake all around then move on. This product is loud and very clear with an even tone and well built with blue-tooth, SD slot, USB slot and radio. Its an all in one product. Install viper4windows or viper4Android and you get top value. These speakers gives maximum output with this tweak. Certainly value for money. Value against price 10/10. Go for it home users.

PS: Check blue-tooth as and when you get it. Change the input mode from button on the main unit to 'bt' and then scan. If your device recognizes this unit then you have a winner. The bt range is unbelievably good. But one minor drawback is, while the total volume offered is 30, with mobile you can manipulate only till 15. Still loud enough though. Enjoy your music folks. Cheers from a happy user.",5
"Its completely made outta cheap shiny plastic, all the wires are like yhe lowest guage possible but the sound is decent enough. Did not find any issues with Bluetooth within the room. Its pretty loud while playing with VLC and other players with sound enhancements but while watching online streaming audibleness quite poor (I fixed the speakers to the corners of my room, may be if you are keeping it near by it might be loud enough). Biggest drawback is it doesn't have any options to adjust bass n treble level, the remote does have a button - eq but i think its just for decorative purpose! Nothing happens. The sub woofer has a multi colored light and the color changes randomly, its kinda cool but it can't be turned off if you like your room to be dark in the night! (I haven't figured out how to turn that off, if anyone knows, pls let me know). Alos i have tried it with my mobile too (bith aux and Bluetooth) sound is clear and loud enough with some decent bass effect. Overall its pretty decent for the price range!",4
Product is fine for the price. Do not expect a lot as there is vibration noticed when you increase the volume. Bluetooth connectivity was questionable as both my android and iOS fails to connect complaining about incorrect PIN or passkey. But I raised a request online and received a call almost immediately from Zebronics. The issue is fixed! Appreciate the support,4

1.st Design :
It's a peice of art , Hight quality metrial , well designed and looking Cool , Made by wood , Color light in woofer looks good and changing automatically after some time (Not based on music) üëçüëç
2.nd sound :
Sound is awesome without any disturbance , Amazing music clearity with loud sound , Lower and upper beets reaily well balanced , No dout its produce Great Sound without any equalizer
3.rd Bass :
In term of Bass this is not justifying its price..
Am Not saying Bass was not good but seriously You have No control Botton.
So you need to control Bass via your equalizer

"Display got defected just after completion of 16 days of purchase.
My return policy is revised to 15days.

Very poor customer service of zebronics. The product is with service center from past 10 days.",1
"Product is good having rang Rs.2470, first time I received damaged product and put request for replacement, I receive the product with in 2 days. Sound quality is excellent, but no option to reset Bass & tribal it is in build, but sound quality is OK. If u want high bass u will have to manage from your mobile, it has Bluetooth to connect with mobile, no proper display to see the song playing on display, I am happy to have this product",4
"After using the speakers for about 4-5 days i am writing this on my experience..
Sound quality is very good...
Bluetooth connectivity is good...
If you use the speaker for 2-3 hours speakers start making annoying sound even when the music is paused...
Don't got the exact reason why it happened..
Now then i let the speaker to switch off for 1 hr then restarted the problem solved for the movement.. But after 1 hr speakers start making annoying sound again...
In this speakers i find everything absolutely fine apart from this problem.....
Now i am not able to use this speaker more than 1 hour it start making annoying sound...
Please focus on this problem otherwise trusted customers will start switching to other brands...",1

Bass - 5/5
Treble - 4/5
Look - 5/5",5
"Sound 10/10
Bass. 10/10
Surround sound 10/10
Sufficient for hall area about 150
Bluetooth 10/10
Really monster sound
Thanks Amazon",5
"An awesome product for my 12x14 feet room. Although the speaker wire was too short and I had to install them in corner of my room, for that I recommend other buyers to buy RCA cables(female to male) to extend the wire.
Audio Quality: 9/10 (-1 for less bass)
Bluetooth Quality: 6/10 (coz it lags sometime and disturbs my wifi connection)
Radio: Do not work in my room(don't know why but since I don't need it so I don't give a damn)
USB Port: 10/10

Please note that once you're connected with your phone through Bluetooth you'll face issues while using wifi(can't say about data pack) like:
Slow Browsing
Buffering(Youtube)
Delay in whatsapp messages.

I bought this item for Rs.2000 and its totally worth it.",5
"Its 4.1 Speaker ...!
First Thing with in 2000 you cannot so much..

** THE BASS QUALITY IS NOT SOO MUCH GOOD...

if you are not high at bass...Then its Srtongly Recommened !

"Our neighbours relax when am not at home,,as I bought this sounds ,,superb bass and sound ,,,,I have my ears sunnnnn...Nnnnnn....When it plays bass booster check from you tube",5
Bought this product 3 months ago from amazon and still no issues with it. Really a good to have BT speakers at this price range.So far happy with it quality and performance.‚ò∫,4
"I did not expect this - I expected an average performer but this one exceeds all expectations. To put things into perspective, it matches my late 90's Sony system that was 90 watts RMS.

The sound quality is quite nice given the drivers have not broken in yet and would take at least 100 to 150 hours of play to start playing like it really should. I'm impressed.",5
"All positive reviews about the BASS are false. I'm keeping the product as it performs good enough for the price range. Bass is decent enough. My Onida TV has 10x better bass than these (Every glass in the room starts vibrating when i turn my TV bass ON)

Bluetooth, USB are all fine. Just a bit disappointed with the bass. Better go for Philips 2.1 in the same price range",3
"I got at 2100 and this is the best speaker you can get it has so many freaking features youll get tired counting.
Has a good wood frame on all speakers and woofer with a polished plastic looks great.
I use bluetooth volume is a bit low but for me it works fine not too loud .
I use it on tv and aux works fine.
With tv volume is fine again not too loud.
And finally this speaker has great bass.
Only problem as i said volume is a little less louder.",5
"Just bought this from Amazon. Packaging was fantastic. There was no chance that it could have damaged during the journey.
Now, coming to the speakers. The quality is fantastic. Sound is crisp and clear. Bass is very good and it turns on even the big rooms and halls into party places.
Connectivity
~USB (Pen Drive or SD Card via USB Card Reader), though there's a different slot for SD MMC.
~SD MMC
~Bluetooth
~And it comes with AUX cable with which you can connect it to anything that has 3.5 mm jack like TVs(that support 3.5 mm jack or if your TV doesn't have one you can buy wires that connect old TVs to 3.5 mm jacks)laptops, desktops, mobile phones, tabs etc.
Overall a must buy. I got it for 1999 during sale but I'd say that even for 3000 it's a fantastic buy as it connects to everything and sound is fantastic and bass is great...
Have a nice day..",5
Its really very nice sound system...at this cheapest price...i love it..but when I see it ..it is very small. I mean..its not middle size...it is small size sound system..but when I remember it's price...I get satisfied at this price...thank you!,4
"Awesome sounds, if the sub woofer speaker were placed at the bottom, sounds could be more vivid since due to vertical placement of the speaker, the diaphragm is vibrating up and down to some extend where for good quality sound it is supposed to vibrated strictly in the horizontal lining. Since it is practically tough to achieve it is always better to place the speaker in the bottom so that gravity can also help the sound to be produced more vividly.",4
"Brother...
u dont get better sound system in only 2099 than this one...
In last 1 month.. i searched for best sound system in 2K- 3k price range...
so after conclusion i go for this system... i ordered this on 12 aug and got today on 16 aug... and seriously in first impression i luved this piece of block buster sound..
some people in previous review said that bass and treble is not good... but in my opinion it has good bass and treble... and best in its price range...

BASS & TRBLE-
There is no any knob for bass and treble but u can adjust through playstore app and inbuilt mobile equaliser.. for me by default it has good bass and treble..

BLUTOOTH-
bluetooth range is limited to only one room... u cant operate from another room... but it has good range...
REMOTE: i dont use remote till now cz there is no cell given by the seller... lol...
FM: gud quality FM, if tower is in your locality..
Light in subwoofer is awesome... makes it very attractive..
So this is all that i analyses.... so go for it dosto...
[...] best of luck.",5
"It is an okay 4.1 system.
Cons:-
1. All speakers wires are of the same length. That means you have to place all the 4 speakers near the woofer. The wires length is approximately 2 feet.
2. Bass is not that deep. But OK for the price.
3. Remote has the equalizer button but it just does not work. I think they probably give a common remote with some of these kind of speakers and this specific model does not support the equalizer feature.
4. The supplied remote does not have the batteries. You'll have to buy them.

Pros:-
1. It has all the required features i. e. Aux, buetooth, memory card, pen drive and FM.
Also, the Aux cable can be found in the box.
2. The FM and the bluetooth features work fine.
3. The sound quality is acceptable. Total RMS is 60 W. Subwoofer is of 20 W and the satalite speakers are of 10 W each.

Sexy speakers for 2k on offer. Only drawbacks are length of the connecting wires of speakers and absence of bass control. Or else this will be the best in this price range. Audio quality and bluetooth connectivity both are working superb!!!,5
"The speakers have good sound and bass, but they cannot be placed separately in four corners. Doing so, distorts the sound. Otherwise, they sound really well. Using it with my TV. Bluetooth has good range. Purchased these in sale for 2000.",4
"Bass is awesome, but no bass control knob,so we have lower the volume , then the speaker wire is short u cannot hang the speakers , in four corners of the room, sound quality is nice!! Bluetooth range is just 5 mts from the device so it ll only suitable for small rooms , eg 10*10 ,12*12 rooms!! Note: speaker wire pin has to be pushed hard into the output socket , other wise u may think , this pin not suits the socket!! So insert it little hard ,till it enters the socket!!",4
"I purchase it 1799/- but sound is awesome, very clear and nice. you may connect with pendrive, cardreader,, bluetooth range super in my house I play and operate from top floor to 1st floor. I am really surprised its range near about 100 to 150 mtrs.. its fullfill my demand of sound on hd diveice or tv or hd movie sound, thanks, .....So don't worry, it s a best buy option, don't hesitate to purchase it not a single minute. Just wantch and buy.....best of luck..",5
I bought this speakers on 10-04-18 for Rs.2518. in this price segment it was ok in price and quality. Have pendrive and microsd slot. Not even i connect FM Still. Speakers Don't have any Nail slot to hang. You need to place it somewhere. Can't Hang in wall. Don't compare the product with Sony. It would be like BMW and Alto. Who need speakers for timepass musiq and not ready to spend more cost for Music System u can choose it.,4
"For a price under 2k, these speakers are pretty decent.

Pros:
1. Decent looking
2. Good quality sound
3. Plenty of features like bluetooth aux fm pendrive sd card slot.

Cons:
1. No, option to manually set a FM channel, you have to press scan and wait for it to automatically tune which is a lengthy process, and it ends up setting 30-35 channels while their are only 8 channels the rest are the frequencies in between.

I rated it 4 out of 5 as I received a damaged remote (It has a big crack on the back, though its still working)",4
"Good and clear sound without noise and distortion even at full volume. Woofer sound is also pleasing. Good finish. Good buy at the price offered at Amazon. Works with Blue tooth, computer, Pendrive, SD/MMC card, CD player, FM Radio ,volume enough for a 15x30 ft hall.",5
Fantastic product in this price good quality sound and high base .,5
"Speakers are good. nothing can be better in that price range.
Bluetooth is working perfectly when connected to my mobile.
I am using it with tv. And it is Good and clear.
Volume level is low just cover single room. So good for personal use. but has a good clarity. In that price range it is the best speaker.
Amazon service was also good. I got it on the same day of booking. That was a surprise for me.",4
"Nice packing .. design is good . Sound is pure and without any disturbance . Bluetooth connectivity is impressive. Bass is as gud as compared to these range speakers . Worth buy . Suitable to medium room . Only a bit of negative thing is ...Bass controller absent. With low volume , u can't expect bass as high and audible. High bass comes with high volume.
Otherwise it's gud to have such budget friendly speakers.",5
Ordered on 23rd Aug. Delivered on 27th Aug. Very happy to receive it so fast to a very remote location... the best product for this price... if u want all features at reasonable cost then go for it...,5
"The product is good and bluetooth functions well but the sound is very less and there is no bass and treble control,so you cant increase the bass and treble...Though I have got it yesterday, so its too quick for me to give a complete review.But the sound is not up to the mark as I thought and is very low compared to the same ranges intex or other music system",3
There is a noise coming from the speaker all the time. And the more time the speaker is turned on the noise is increased. It makes it very unpleasant. Unfortunately this started after three weeks. And my return window was closed by that time. So I am not able to return nor able to exchange. That noise causes headache too.,2
"Every Products sold by cloudtail retailer are truly authentic, fast and safe delivery.Amazon has become my shopping stop are very responsive.recently I bought this set of zebronics believe me it's awesome clarity and mindblowing bass at this price range. Extraordinary Bluetooth's range response work from other room also.nice display and lighting.It's at par with my expectations.",5
"1. Very Fast Shipping. Received the item in just one day at Bengaluru
2. Packing and Shipping is good everything was intact
3. The Product finish quality is excellent considering the Price of under 2K
4. Quality of Sound also pretty good again keeping in mind the price
5. Bluetooth connectivity was very easy

The only thing I found missing was the remote did not have a battery and had to rush to the local shop to get it. But then this is no big deal.

Overall worth every pai you paid for",5
"Sound Quality is good for this price range. worth buying.
Pros: lowest price better quality for the area of 700 to 800 sq. ft.
Bluetooth mode works well which comes very handy connecting phone.

Cons: Remote is utterly useless. Every time you press any button it gets struck inside. And it does not work most of the time.
But since I connect through Bluetooth or ipod it is only time press so I do not mind using the speaker buttons itself.",4
"Excellent speaker
Pros:
Good sound
Good bass
Build quality is good
LED lights in the speaker is awesome
BT range is good
Cons:
Short cable for speakers
No Aux cable
Remote doesnt come with a battery",5
"Very good product.. The only thing is there is no control on bass!! Except that everything is excellent.. happy with the product.
EDIT:
Purchased this awesome piece 8 months before. Now 2 speakers stopped working. Have to search for service centre.!!!",4
"Update:
Stopped working suddenly without any reason. It has been not even a year.

This has been one of my best purchases on Amazon. I am just in love with this product. Now, don't get me wrong, it might not compete with the likes of Sony in terms of sound quality, but for the money that you pay, you get a very balanced sound output. The bass is not great but decent, not overpowering. The overall sound signature is decent and it is great for normal day-to-day usage. If you are want something which is value for money, this is the one for you. I have been using it for over 5 months and it has never left me unimpressed.

Now, the best part of it - the Bluetooth connectivity. I have used Philips Bluetooth speakers before and it was a pain connecting it as the connectivity always kept losing. With this product, the range is extremely good. I have never faced any lag or connectivity issue even a single time yet. Not only this, even if you are out of the line of sight, it works without any issue until you are within 15m range. I have played songs while being inside my bathroom ;) in my room and the speaker being in the hall of a one bhk flat and it worked flawlessly every single time.

Amazon delivery was also great and the product was delivered in a good condition.

Conclusion - If you want a good wireless speaker with a balanced sound output on a tight budget, go for it. It has all the basics correct, Bluetooth connectivity being an important one.",2

 Superbly Bess awesome really enjoyed music I'm buying this product date 27 Feb. I'm received March 1... Express delivered.. I'm so happy good products by amazon.. I love it Amazon staff.. Thanks for amazon.. And good good best best best best product my second product",5
"Awesome music system....
Cons
1. no easy provision for placing speakers around the room (length of wires very short)....

2.It actually has only 2 channels ie 2 speakers for left and 2 speakers for right.

Pros.
Other than what I have mentioned above everything is perfect.
1 great sound quality with superb bass.
2 good remote and Bluetooth sensitivity
3 it has 4 10w speakers which gives louder sound than many 5.1 systems.
4 I got it for 2.6 K @ this price I feel wonderful
5 quality of sound is comparable with f&d",5
"One of the best choice of speaker i have made!
Using this product since last 1 year amazing quality sound is great in terms of bass , treble & overall sound quality is excellent. I've purchased this for home use like for tv & computer it have all the features which you need. & In this Price segment it is the best choice! It coat me around 2.2k but you will get it around 2k as of now on lighting deal just wait for it.",5
"Awesome speakers. Bought in 1999 Rs. Totally worth it. Best bass in this range. I tried 5.1 set of same company in 2290, but bass was not up to the mark. So I returned that one. Highly recommended.

Although remote of the speaker was broken. Still it was in working condition.",5
It's the worst experience. Amp is not working at all from day 1. This is just a show piece. Really this is very pathetic quality product. Sending it back is now double work. One star is also waste for this. Finally got it repaired for 500 Rs. Transformer was of low quality which didn't work at all.,1
"Good timing delivery.
Small damage in the main unit, due to poor packing.
* Good sound for a 15*15 room. Bass & treble is tuned fine, don't get a negative thought for missing bass control knob.
* Bluetooth / sd card / USB / aux connectivity works fine. FM connectivity is slightly poor.
* Remote works fine. Equalizer works only for Sd card / USB only. But it is not a problem can adjust the sound in mobile music player when connected to Bluetooth.
* Wire lengths are small , both power & speakers.
## For the price it will satisfy the buyers.
A star less for damage in the main unit, see the attached photo.",4
"Giving it 3 stars, delivery was late by amazon this time

Speakers are good and loud, though the bass is not as much as expected, but still its enough for 1 room,
Bluetooth works fine and connectivity is not more than 20 feet as observed,

The bass woofer creates some distinct kind of noice, which is not in the song played..

The biggest issue i found out is that the speakers doesnt have bass control knob, it has only one knob for volume control, and second issue i saw here is that the EQ mode doesnt work on bluetooth and AUX mode...

But still it is good at the budget of 2k.

I still advice you to go for philips or sony if you can increase your budget to 4k...",3
"The product is truly osam. Tried playing videos with Dolby sound on YouTube and I was amazed to hear what I didn't expect, there is no distortion at all whatever music or sound you play. You can try any music on it, my hall is around 300 sq ft, no disappointment , rather even u can't hear what other says if the volume is full. The blue tooth connectivity is good ..... The look is good.... But I don't expect more from a 2000 rs product..... Buy it you would not be dissapointed....... Enjoy",5
"Pleasant sound from small speakers.
Base is good and you need to adjust the equalizer in your phone if you're connecting via (BT)Bluetooth.
FM working.
Works great in a 10/10 small room or hall.
Pendrive working.
Card reader working.
Not much effect via AUX cable
Overall good product under 3k and works great in a small room or hall.",4
Lenth of the wires is too small. Boss is not upto the mark and there is no individual sound control for each speaker,1
"It is an average product even though I wan't expecting much from it anyways at this price. Out of the box, the biggest annoyance is the extremely short wires for the satellite speakers. And every time you turn it off, the volume that you've set with the remote resets to max. There's no fabric or net covering for the diaphragms, so you'll have to ensure that they're kept clean. There's no equalizer of any sort - the remote is just for volume, changing input source, and On/Standby.
And like other users warned, after just a few weeks of use, the woofer has started hissing and popping even when it is on standby. As long as it gets electricity, it happens, and it rapidly becomes annoying. I can't return mine because I've already cut and spliced longer speaker wires.
On the plus side, it is decently loud for a small apartment and even gives some sort of a surround sound vibe. I haven't used any other input methods other than PC, but others should appreciate the Bluetooth and USB/SD Card inputs",2
"Drawbacks - Remote, 2.1 channel.
Pros - Easy to setup
Good Bass and Treble (Balanced sound quality)
Bluetooth is Good.
Radio is nice but remote sucks.
overall 4 out of 5.
Good one.",4
"I bought it 6 months ago. Overall, its a good system however, there are a few issues. One, like some earlier reviews said, bass is really not good in this. Two, sometimes when I'm trying to control the input (fm/aux/BT) the volume instead, increases and decreases, from the remote. So the remote control is not helpful at these times. Three, every time you switch the system on, after switching off, the volume starts from the highest so it starts blasting music.",3
"Very Nice product..Nice sound quality, Nice look..perfect for home..go for this if you don't need very high bass.
Only con is ..button or facility to change bass and trouble is missing.",4
Cheap quality of the product. I didnt expect that. Subwoofer gave burning smell and right channel speakers weren't working at all.. Really shocked by the QC of this product. Never buying again!,1
"Very Good Speaker !
Very Very HAPPY to buy this Zebronics Bluetooth Speaker at great price in Amazon Deal.
I am very happy to Use the Zebronics Bluetooth Speaker !
I have no idea about the warranty of the product and that is one thing Amazon has to inform the customers at the time of purchase.",5
"This is a very good speaker at this prize range.
But think before you buy... I received a damaged product and replaced it and got this one...",4
"Review after 5 months optimum usage.

Speakers humming continuously. And sometime FM Channels not found.

Nice sound in this price range.

But some issues are facing by me

1. FM channels are not saved.
2. I have connected settop box to Smart TV and aux cable plugged in Smart TV's 3.5 mm jack but when I am watching from Set Top Box sound not coming. Only humming comes. and when I played from USB of Smart TV only two speakers sounds are coming.
3. No instruction manual comes with package. How would I know for correct setup of speakers.
4. Aux Cable and speakers Cable length are very short. If you are unable to given lengthy cable why you are not make a provision for jack system so that customer extend the cable as per requirement. Otherwise we have to cut the Pin and joint the wire and make the whole system as JUGAD. At least cable of two speakers should be 15-20 feet so that we can arrange the system as Left/Right Front and Left/Right Rear.
5. No hanging or wall mounting option is given in speakers.
6. No Power on off button given in Remote. Every time when I start huge humming sound coming.

All above are not a big things or we want some more in this price but I think its quite good some manageable options.

Pl guide / solve the above problems.",3
Very.... Good superb bass volume is also good thanks zebronics and and very cheap price sound also good in full volume,5
"i liked the product. but th reason i didnt give 5 star is it has no bass control. also the maximum sound output is less than i expected. but having this bluetooth device at this rate, its the best. go for it.",4
This product is good.. but the reason I gave only one star is that.the day I received it..the main woofer was non functional. The packing was fine but speakers were damaged from inside. I have asked for a replacement and my request is under process but I suggest buyers to go for Phillips or F&D which are more reliable,1
"Delivery is in time.
Cost of the product is Reasonable
Best Product.
Sound system is Super
Bluetooth connection excellent
FM connection very simple.
Beautiful Style and Modal.
Excellent Excellent.",5
"Those people who are rating this product comparing with Philips, Sony or other renowned brand, they are actually fool!

If you see this one as a Zebronic Product and if you compare it with its features and price then it is just awesome..
It's great bass, loud, 4 speakers, looks,woofer,bluetooth function,aux cable,remote,fm,usb,meromy card adapter, even very interesting led lights are available in just around 2k.. really which was unbelievable for.. but now I'm using it with a great experience!

So if You are finding many functions and good quality product in cheaper rate.. then just blindly go for it..",5
"It is a product worth buying !
Once i opened the package , i was truly happy looking at all the accessories they gave me with it .
Just connect via bluetooth or Aux or Even Pendrives!!!
Everything works just fine..
Audio quality is Awesome....",5
"Initial impression :
The speaker is stylish and has good features. I connected it with my LED tv and it works good as my tv has equalizer function as this speaker has no bass knob.
Overall the sound output and bass is good for its price(I got it for ‚Çπ2000)",4
It was beyond my expectations.for this price I couldn't find any product in the market. Bass is good nd all the aspect.I would personally recommend this product.the only thing I feel bad is that wire length to the speaker are little short .for that I took one star except that everything is perfect,4
"Best price
Good quality.
Best woofer..
Very nice.
Sound effects good
Really very happy..",5
Speaker sounds good worth for the money. But which one i have received blue tooth connectivity problem. So return request submitted. Returned and replacement got. Now Bluetooth is workinv well..!,4
"Cool Product at this range...
Product was good but found little damaged from a corner but nothing to worry.
Delivery was on time but delivery guys generally asking to come out from my working place.
Package was weighted | big and should deliver at doorstep .
Thank you for good deal.",4
"After using a month now i can give my full opinion,
First of all the quality of the sound is good and at that price its worth.The bluetooth feature is amazing but maximum range is 8metres.
There is no bass control but the bass is good at optimal volume as we all use some sort of equalizer so it can be adjusted that way.
Overall if you are planning to buy it i'm sure it will be worth.",4
"Everything okay in this home theater. But I expected many things from this. There's small small disadvantages
1. can't reduce the bass levels there is no bass adjustable
2. Can't hangout in wall there is no wall mount holes in speakers
3. Speakers wires r not lengthy it's just 1.5meter wires.",4
I was very excited with these new speakers it worked really well with my laptop & phone but the real dissapointment was when i connected it to the tv. It gives a continous humming sound likes hissssssss & u just cant ignore it. I started to have a headache because of that. Apart from that its a good product.,3
These are only wired speakers. Can't fina any bluetooth connectivity!,1

"It's a good piece with satisfactory bass and sound. All is good. What's lacking are two things what I feel.... surround sound and mesh in front speakers. It has four satellite speakers but I don't feel the surrounding sound. And without mesh, dust is always ready to seep in. Otherwise a good buy for that price.",4
"I have recieved a good product everything working fine but packing is not good and safe...

*Bluetooth,SD card,usb everything working fine...good product from Amazon...they delivered within two days....I bought it for deal RS.1700...try to pay via Amazon pay they are giving me RS.300 cashback ...",4
I got it in 2000/- so nice in price band... Material used is good... Nice finishing .... Sound quality Little worst.... But in this price range it's OK.... After some times woofer effect goes down .. sound clearance 3.5 star..... If you look for pure sound effects In all way .... Get ready to spend more than 6000 in Philips,5
"One of the best product to own with the smart features and the price Tag is one of the best to buy .
everyone must go for it .
i would give 110 % mark for the Product.
since I was having a Birthday Party this Product has supported me well for myKids Birthday Bash.
Thank You Amazon Thank You Zebronics for the Product",5
"The sound is very good and the bass is good in low budget Bluetooth range is good this is best hometheatre for you ,Thank you zebronics",4
Mind blowing! Very satisfied with this price range we can't get these features in any other sound system. Wonderful purchase! ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜThanks Amazon....,5
Speakers have very good sound equiling system and preety loud voice.Bt range is also very very good.Guys Buy it without any question.,5
"Better product. Rank 4 is given because of good sound quality. Actually I should have given 3 because

1) No Bass and Treble controls for LED / TV / PC inputs.
2) Length of wires is too short
3) Blinking LED ( Multicolour ) lights looks cheap its not required.
4) Woofer should have been front firing for more better results.

Just I noticed a better sound amplification and given rank 4",4
"Great Speakers with Good Bass and Nice sound, This is the best you can get in so low price of 2.5k ,Nothing is better than this trust me . Don't compare with 10k + Price speakers as you are not paying even 1/4 of their price , Deep bass, Nice sound , Go for it",5
"Bestest deal you can get in this price
They are damn clear and loud enough
6of my friends bought the same product after seeing this nice keep it up guys ....",5
"Writing this Review after being use of 30 days.
The quality of the Speakers is very good! But wires is very small, you can‚Äôt even put the speakers in every corner of a small room. and the connector I got had some problem, I purchased it from outside again!
You might get different volume while using with Laptops and Mobile! In Laptop volume will be higher and in Mobile it‚Äôs much low volume.
I would say with this much of money you can‚Äôt get better than this.",3
"Sound output is very loud. Very Good basss. Bluetooth works as expected. But it is of shorter range. You should be in the same room as the speaker. Wires are also very small, you can extend with extra wires. There is no separate controller for changing bass output. Remote controller is good.",5
"Received the product with proper packing and on time delivery from amazon.
The sound clarity and bass quality are excellent.
I compared it with philips speakers and found it's sound quality best due to wooden speakers.
Bluetooth feature is very useful and works well.
Perfect for home use and small parties.
I would give it 5 star due to perfect sound and best price.
A value for money product.
..Thanks amazon",5
Hi guys ..I booked this multimedia speaker system after going through the review.I booked it on the 17 the and received the product on the 21 st..Amazon has delivered it prety fast.The blue tooth and sound quality of this unit is good at this point..The bass could have been better..The only drawback is the FMs signal ...Nevertheless a good product at this price..Cheers to Amazon and Zebronics...,4
"VEry nice product in this price range, sound is clear and enough for indoor use. If you are looking for a system for loud and quality music inside home its perfect for you. bluetooth feature is added advantage. Bass adjustment is missing a bit but its ok for me.",5
"Initially i was a bit choosy about it whether i shud buy this or f&d but my budget was tight hence opted for this... Got it for 1599/- in lightning deal (1999/- offer & 400 amazon cashback) in such a low price its damn awesome... When i played it on max volume it was like hell damn, its small but quite loud... Considering its price point... Infact i bought it without hearing it even so i was a bit worried... But M really happy with it no flaws till now... Dont go for negative reviews if your budget is tight go for it...
Hopefully it will last long... :)
p.s. Dont think u ll get heart thumping bass for such low price thus increase ur budget if u want more bass... For this price its a deal cracker...",5
"Worth for my 2000rs...Bluetooth connected easily...FM super...connected with laptop, my pc, and also my TV...no problem at all",5
"Hello, guys this a good speaker in this category.It has medium bass.Extra bass lovers install viper4windows or other equalizer apps for more enjoyment.",5
Extremely happy with this Speaker as good as expected,5
"Sound is of good quality, Good design and built.
There are however two shortcomings,
1. It lacks a base adjuster. This is I persume a basic requirement.
2. The connector wires are of 3ft length. They should have been more to place it around.

System is worth buying but not if you want a base adjuster",4
"Dear team,
I have recd the order with good condition. Excellent product, to this price.
I could not connect my phone as Usb device.
Also, the equializer option available while connecting Usb only. Not with BT or auxillary.

Other than this i really liked this product",4
"I have been using the speakers for more than one week and I can say that the speakers are awesome, very nice sound. If you want to buy just go for it without giving a second thought.",5
A good buy not great.. Volume levels are bit low but for a small room will suffice...While connected as auxiliary we here a hiss which at lower volumes remains hidden. The blue tooth and usb are perfect so is the remote function. FM can improve. A good choice in the 2000 range,3
"hi! sound is crisp clean but BASS is not good enough want to return it and get it exchanged for something which provides more bass and has an equalizer setting which works on Bluetooth connectivity too.

Just opened yesterday as my daughters room was under renovation , not very happy with the bass , please advise",3
"Good product, good sound clarity, only one draw back, bass & tribble does not have seperate controller, only volume controller is there & all satellite speakers connection wires equal size, little bit shorter, any way over all good experiance",4
Delivered product difective..didn't turn on anyway..lets see what about the replaced product..It will reach me within three days they say...,1
Superb speakers and with bt connectivity @1700 it is a steal!!!. Thank u amazon. Crystal clear sound and bass is reasonably good at this price.Good enough to connect to my led TV.,4

"I got this speaker in amazon deal at 2,299 Rs sound is amazing i played this in my Basement hall which is very big in size but the sound delivered by speakers were amazing.
according to me these speakers give best sound when connected via laptop or computer, i connected via mobile and bluetooth the sound comes lil bit slow and bass is also not that much effective.
All four speakers working fine
Woofer working amazing
Bluetooth, USB, FM working good
Remote i din't checked yet.",5
"In this price range ,this is best player üëçgood bass but there is no bass and terible control but there are various equaliser presets mods ..light effect in subwoofer is too good in dark
Fm, pendrive, card , and bluetooth and 3.5 mm support",4
"Awesome sound, what a worth of taking this item in music category...guys go for it...

Nice Bluetooth connectivity range, great bass worth money

As usual got early by Amazon service

Thank you",5
At This Price Range the product is really good and if you want to get the best sound of it use a usb drive with 320 bit song and use it's built in equalizer.But One Thing That Totally Disappointed me That From The 1st Day FM radio is not working the signal quality is worst i have another sudip player i use them at same position with same fm station but the Zebronic not getting any signal like my other one,2
"1 ) Little buzzing sound comes from the the two satellite speakers ,
2 ) base controler is absent
3 ) good look and glossy
4 ) your product will be in waranty (as given in discription ""1 year"") only of your pack is opened by the authorised zebronic employee
if you want a standard speakers for home , they are very good one, if you get it safely received , you are one of the lucky person , at this price , the speakers are too good",4
"product looks different and quality is very cheap. they deceive your mind with pictures but it wont be as when you get the product. sound quality of this one was okay but not excellent, Bluetooth connectivity is good and aux response is bad, you wont get proper sound effect as from Bluetooth. so, for this price range , its okay for few days usage.",2
Nice sound quality.bluetooth working very fast and range is also too good.bass and Trimble combination is fantastic.packing is also too good .it is very nice product produce by amazon.,5
"Speakers are really fantastic in this price range. Bass treble is very nice. But there is no treble and bass button but you will control it through your phone. Glossy finish, clear sound.",5
Just Received It Today ! Superb Quality of Sound and Bass !! delivery is too fast just 5days! At Price 2199. Looks are Just Fabulous!! I'm listening it Right now ! THANKS A LOTS AMAZON ALSO THANKS TO SELLER !!,5
speaker is very good it is good sound and very high quality sound this product is very good to purchase music home theater with Bluetooth,5
"It's a very good product in this price range. The sound quality is great. No distortions at all at high volumes. Bass and treble are balanced, with bias towards bass. I'm a basshead and I'm very happy with it's output. It can easily be used in a large bedroom or hall. Although Bluetooth can be used for playback, I recommend using the AUX cable, as there is no transmission loss.

You might have to use an equalizer, so that you can set the bass/treble according to your liking, if you prefer. It feels premium and well built.The only issue i felt is that the satellite speaker cables could have been longer.",4
"After restart of the system, its sound volume automatically goes to top side. Very irritating. Sound is not upto the mark. It has not surround sound. No any cable to connect with led tv. Remaining is ok.",3
"Guys believe me it has zero bass... U can expect only treble and treble only üò≠.. Clarity is pretty good concerning price tag but again it has no bass at all.. So at the end its just useless. Wires of 4 speakers are in equal size and too shot. Look is stylish and shiny. Fm doesn't work properly, i tried hard... Subwoofer cracks bass. I bought it for 1999 and now returning..

Oredered for replacement since there is no option for returning of this product. I hope i will get better one. I will post once again after i get the replacement.
I got the replacement within 1 day. As expected the speakers are very good in this price range.",4
Sound is ok bass is vary low if you're bass lover please don't bay this product waste of money ‚ùå,1
"I won't say its best in its class, but it has decent sound. Bass does not have enough punchy sound, but its not bad too be ignored. Build quality is very poor, need to handle with care.",4
Sound quality is good. But there is no way to adjust bass/treble which is a biggest drawback,4
"there is no bass in this music system, i want to return this but amazon stupid policy of replacement sucks. I wanted to buy a better system with good bass, i am ready to pay extra too but i have no idea how to contact seller. Bad experience buying electronics item from amazon, wont ever buy electronics again from amazon",1
Awsome Speaker good quality.......,4
"1)Sound : soft, not so high, its average or normal
2)Bass and terrible : Not available
3) Bluetooth, Aux, usb , sd card slot, fm : good
Remarks : i cut 1 star for ""Sound not high"" & 1 star for ""bass not available"".
Recommend :(a) for low budget : this is best
(b) for high budget : purchase only branded product",3
Guys it is really awesome and the sound quality is very nice,5
"I like it. Good for a room. Bass is okay but no bass control option. Manual buttons have delay action as well as remote.
Overall product is okay for this price range.better then intex.",4
good but FM is not working and there is no proper protection layer/cover on the top of speakers,3
"Good product as per the price range. Some issues are: a. Next/prev button not working, acting as soft volume up/down. b. Equaliser only have 5 presets which is not working in FM Mode.c.speaker connecting wire is little less in length",3
"I bought this a month back and now some kind of sound is coming from the music system..I bought it in advance to fit it in the shop...But now when the fittings are done,sound is coming from the music system which is really bad and disappointing,After the fittings only,it started came,There is no option to contact with the seller so I am posting this review..
Thankyou",1
"I got this speakers @ 2200 /- Fully satisfied with prime 1 day delivery.
Who are looking for speakers under 3000 range this is the best deal out there for you. Go with it without having a second thought.
Quality is good, Sound is clear with good bass. I'm heart fully satisfied with this 4.1 channel home theatre.",4
ordered it for a friend and she seems satisfied with it for now. everything attached is in working condition for now. issues with bluetooth connectivity though,4
"Value for money.. excellent delivery
Sound quality is better... It might have more bass effect.. but still good..
Suggestion : Go for it",5
"As usual arrived early. Thanks to Amazon. I attached it with my Sony tv. Great sound quality. Bass is awesome. BT is working fine, I play music from my mobile using BT. No problem in connecting devices. Only one problem no manual bass setting.",4
"I have replaced the product as the first product was defected. But now after replacing the product, it is working fine and I am in love with it. Purchased in price 2341 with additional 300 cash back over Amazon pay balance made the product more value for money. If some one want to purchase, don't get much confusion, just go for it.",4
"This is the best home theater for this prize, good bass, good volume everything is balance no need of adjusting bass and trable it automatically balance sound quality...very good product.",5
After using ten month its become useless not even turn on really its just wasting of money really now I feel bad about my previous review,1
The speakers are good...the bass is good only if we raise the volume...the main plus point is Bluetooth enabled...the plug is little short..best speakers under 3000,4
"Very good speaker at Rs.2300/- with Bluetooth connectivity. But don't expect too much bass.
No bass control and treble control. Little bit 'hrrrrr' noise at full volume. Satellite speakers wire length is only 3 feet, so you need extension wire if you are placing the speakers at a particular distance.
I have connected this speaker with my led TV. I was watching a ODI cricket, initially the sound was very good, but at the end of the match (after 8 hours) the sound became very low (volume became less than the TV speakers). So you can use this speaker 5 to 6 hours continuously.",4
"Don't be fooled these are computer speakers...and no return is allowed, feeling cheated",1
Third class product didn't working after one year of use remote is also not working properly.,1
"At given price of 2000 in deal, it is a very good deal. Base isn't that great as some people claim here. Its just ok. Few 2.1 systems have better sound output.",4
It should get zero üåü but there is no option. The sound is even less than my TV and the name of woofer and bass is a cheating really. Really heart breaking for music lovers. Initiated the return process. Time to see Amazon services.,1
"Pros:
Nice product for home use.
Good sound quality.
Can be used for small home party.

Cons:
Very small connecting wire.
No Battery with remote.
Bluetooth range to very impressive.",4
Excellent product at this price range. The only issues are less bass and bass control is not present. Speaker cables are small also. The Bluetooth connectivity is great.for small rooms it is an excellent product.,4
"Everything is good but wires are small. My Buying price 2300rs, i m not happy to buy this.",2
"i got this speaker for rs 2150 on 5 of nov ....when i got i play a song its sound is good but after two days i am facing a sound problem ...i think for return but i go to servicr centre they exchange the speaker with new one. ....
thanz for zerbonics service centre",4
its doesnt have buttons or dial so uh cant adjust it manually theater automatically set bass nd treble if not a bass lover uh can go for this but if uh want bass nd set it manually you can go for zebronics samba or zebronics mambo if uh want expensive than this otherwise this product have good sound and bass,3
Nice product in this price if you want to buy a good speaker in lower price than it is a good choice. Sound quality is also very good.,5
"At this price, 2.3k worth features. Bluetooth feature is a bonus.",5

Best speakers for the price no doubt! Good Bass and treble! Must buy for anyone with budget under 3000 Rs.,5
"Excellent speakers for connecting to devices where equaliser is accessible. Brilliant base at this price range. But for the AUX connectivity to the devices which don't have option to customise sound, not that good. (Like connecting to a TV doesn't give a good sound)",4
"This product is very gud. It's sound is superb. It works very well. But something is wrong. It has not bass controller. It has not heavy sound. When usb card inserted & give full volume, it is switched off & again plucked out the usb & inserted again then it's work. It's FM doesn't work properly. But it looks very nice. I give it 3 üåü",3
It has good sound quality and i m happy with this zebronic 4.1 speaker.,5
I got defective product. USB & sd card is not working.. when i am inserting pen drive no music is playing.. used 2 pieces..same issue,1
"Good product, value for money. Good sound good, good bass.only problem is No bass and treble control, it is greater problem.",4
Very nice product. Working excellent with my desktop computer and my mobile. Bluetooth working excellent from any corner of my house. Woofer is also amazing.,5
I have purchased it 15days back. First unit received was faulty making lots of hissing noise and had to replace it. Got replacement however I am facing hissing noise issue again. Now I can't return it but to repair it. No reliable system may be because of low cost. Recommend to go for good branded speakers system as it's reliable. Don't purchase it.,2

"Quality product from Zebronics. Never expect a boom sound, but it is ok for a normal hall. It works well with my Sony bravia LED Tv.",4
"Product is excellent and as advertised. Value for money speakers if you aren't looking for them to last decades.
One flaw is that all the 4 speaker have the same cable length(which is pretty short) so in order to actually place the rear speakers at a bit of a distance, you will need and extending cable, which may sometime cause some signal loss.
And part of the casing on the woofer vibrates sometimes on low frequency bass.
But otherwise, no other complaints so far.",4
THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT.. YOU CAN TRY FOR IT......,5
"Well got this today on 04-01-2018. As many person has written that the bass n vooume has some issue. Yes it has bt only with fm. Since the person buying this definitely not going toh play fm songs. Didn't tried it with tv. Bt with BLUETOOTH AUX AND SD/USB eorking perfect.
N the bass n volume also depends upon the deice or quality of songs.",5
I bough it this diwali in lightening sale.. Really a nice speaker with great woofer and sound. I am happy.. But I do not know how to set FM.. Does anyone know??,5

"Yesterday I recieved the Zebronics 2.1 Bluetooth Speaker, Today I,m Writing the review
Pros-
1. Nice Looks and Design is Pretty Good and attractive for its 3colour LED inside the subwoofer
2. Sound Quality is As good as the price tag say, in a normal room it,s sound quality is pretty decent.
3. Bluetooth facility is totally hassle free, Just Press Input Button and the bluetooth mode turns on.
4. Extremely affordable, You Can,t get an 2.1 branded speaker at 1.7K (Great Indian Sale) with AUX IN, BLUETOOTH, SD-USB and Digital Display
5. Multi Purpose Remote is provided.
Cons-
I have Found a single issue, that is VERY SHORT POWER CABLE AND SATELLITE SPEAKER CABLE that doesn't allows you to spread the speakers all over the room.(It decreases One Star)

Overall Verdict-
If you in the market for a 2.1 speaker with various connectivity input options then this Zeb. Product is very much recommended for you.
Zeb has also promised for 1 yr overall warranty.

Amazon verdict- Packaging very good
delivery in 3 day( They Refunded the Extra payment for guaranteed 2 day delivery as it comes late)
Very Good Customer Support",4
On lower sound bass is good. But big sound bass is not good. Unable to connect it to my TV,3

ii) One speaker is creating a burrrr sound.",3
Very nice looking and good performance...,5
"Using since last four months and fully satisfied with it. I have also used Intex IT-301 N FMU but I have found Zebronics more justifying when compared with sound quality, features and price. However, I have observed a very irritating humming sound from woofer when used for long hours.",4
"2 Speaker not working
Product is defective , bass quality is very poor, don't buy this product, TOTAL WASTE OF YOUR MONEY",1

"These are best speakers I currently have at this price range.I first checked it's review on Amazon, on YouTube Everyone saying it's good or best but when I actually listen them, I feel so good to have these in this price range. These are beast if you connect them with Bluetooth.Not good with aux.",5
"Sound quality is ok. Bass/treble is balanced but not extraordinary.
My flip 2 sounds louder than these. Other features are also ok.
But loudness is very sub standard for a 4.1 setup. (I tried aux, bt, pendrive with multiple songs.)",2
"I brought for 2k,its worth more than that!",5
"Best woofer at these price range.got it for 2300 bucks.awesome bass, mind blowing sound.i would recommend to go for these ones.phillips Sony can never provide such quality at these price range......thank u zebronics :). The sound shakes my room that also with half volume.if I do full volume neighborhood will complain hahaha.works fine with my PC.....and I use Bluetooth to listen also",5
"I purchased it after looking at so many positive reviews. This product is a sheer disappointment due to the following reasons:
1>No Bass controll
2>At its 100% volume gives lesser sound than the amount produced at 40~50% by my LG TV.
3>Sound doesn‚Äôt feel like coming from a an external loud speaker(Poor quality sound).
Ultimately you would purchase external speakers because you need louder sound. This does not do justice in that department.

There are few good aspects as well:
1> Blue tooth pairing is not an issue. Connects well across vaious devices.",1
Defective piece received on great indian festival. I have purchase 2 speaker on this occasion and both product are defective. I think they are selling reused product on these type of featival offer. Very bad experience. I have purchase so many things with amazon but this time i m disappointed.,1
"I was really confused as to what to buy, then my father advised me to go for this as he is an engineer and knows in and out of electronics, I ordered it. When I switched it on, I paired it with my mobile and played some songs but the sound was really low, even from the knob available on the main woofer didn't increase much sound. After reading the manual I got to know about volume increase from remote and from the next button on the main woofer. Once you increase the volume from the remote or ""Next"" button on main woofer you'll be amazed with the sound and bass.
PS: Also there's one hidden setting, you have to attach the USB and change to USB mode and then you can even select the different settings from remote like ""Pop"",""Classic"" etc for different sound effects",5
"BT status doesn't give Bluetooth connectivity. Bluetooth not functional.

Make and body finish of the product is not up to the mark.

Woofer body was broken as added in the pics due to which it only kinda hangs out.

Sub sounding do necessarily require the speaker set else standalone woofer is useless.

Since am not at all satisfied with the product wanted to return but shows only replace. On calling Customer care they said to replace the product, if the quality is not up to the mark it will be considered for return. (Headache for the long process.. No value to the Advertising saying of no question asked returns)

Expecting the similar material and body make for the replaced product to be returned.",1
"I have brought. This speaker a month back but now it's completely not working if on I can able hear loud beeb noise that's it ,,,, amozon cheating cheating is to giving such a products ,,,,",1
"It's much better than I expected...
Bass is good...
Quality is awsome for this price..
I got it for 2599...

The only drawback i felt is that there is no provision to adjust bass and treble seperately...

Otherwise mindblowing...",4
"Awesome product !
Mind blowing performence...
Everythin working fine ...
Bass is awesome

Looks very cool ....
BT working very well ..
Thank you amezon for fastest delivery and thank you to zebronic company .

"I am an user of Onkyo systems for years. Was sceptical about buying zebronics, but the sound quality exceeded my expectations, superb sound quality to fill up the room, boomy bass, Sound is good for 75% of volume, beyond that it looses quality. Good for a small room for laptop, Bluetooth connectivity is very good.",5
Okay product but my honest review is to go for another one coz it makes a loud hiss sound when the equipment is plugged in and not in use .. The noise become un-bearable after few hours coz it gets amplified,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I would say this product is the best at this price, I am totally satisfied with everything related to this product. I would recommend everyone to buy this one who are looking for a best quality home theater. Sound quality is really awesome!! And the quality of speakers and woofer box is amazing!! Well designed!! Well packed !!
No Cons are found so far in this product. Completely loved it. Thank you so much Zebronics for best quality and assurance and special thanks to Amazon for lovely service.üòç",5
"My favorite brand longingly to buy since 1997, when I first saw Zebratronic sytems in Mumbai exhibition stall at BKC. I have used other brand systems but didn't get satisfaction. With affordable price. Atlast I bought this system last week from Amazon at 2999 without any deal. Very powerful sound, every thing perfect. Only thing I wanted in this system was wireless speakers and 5.1 Dolby . For 10x15 room 60watt out is sufficient. I hope the manufacturer will upgrade the model to above mentioned suggestions with affordable price.",5
I'm giving 5 star because it's a beautiful product. Very nice sound quality. Awesome bass. Full rock sound. It's amazing. Zebronics gives fantastic products. Beautiful Design. Value of money. Every one should buy this. I recommend this product to everyone who needs a good sound system.,5
Bass is superb. Sound quality is very fine and this sound is pleasant to hear. In this rate it is the best brand. But wires provided to speakers are less length which is not useful for keeping all speakers around room edges,5
"I bought these on my birthday.
Delivered exactly on date.

Nice speakers.
Love them.
Good sound, loud enough for a jam session.
Breathing RGB LED.

Small chords for surround, so basically I cut the chords and tape normal wire to it.
Now there's one speaker at the end of the room in each corner, while the woofer sits beneath TV.
Cinema experience...üòâ",5
"I am writing this review after using the speakers for 2 years. It is one of the best buys in audio system.
Sound quality is good. Bass is preset but it is perfect so not to worry on same.Sound will not distort even when volume is full. Bluetooth connectivity is good and it auto connects when connected with device.remote access is still working perfect. Bestt buy in this range.",5
"If u are using it with smartphone , it won't get that loud or won't be very clear , but once connected to pc , this becomes a beast , volume goes very high as compared to smartphone as well as clarity and balance of the sound , u can increase the quality of output even further by tweaking some window's sound settings.",5
Great sound quality.. Bass is low but sound quality is awesome. Bluetooth connection is quick. Also looks great.. Smooth delivery by Amazon,5
"The speakers have very good sound quality. The remote works for a long time. The battery consumption is less. The Bluetooth connects without any problem to any phone/laptop.
I would like more controls but unfortunately, there are no controls for bass and treble. It has only one setting for these, but it is good.

The service:
The service was amazing as always, the item was delivered timely in perfect condition.",5
Fully satisfied...Nice bass and treble ..Just awwsome....somtimes feel missing the bass switch to control the bass ! The best home theater under rs.2600...Average brand with best deal ....,5
"Very nice sounds... Nonetheless, I got 1 damaged speaker at first... Replaced and got a perfect one finally! Thanks Amazon!",5
Product is nice.Sound quality is too good.. But sometimes it looses it's Bluetooth connection.Look is very brilliant.It will obviously give you a small threatre feelings.It doesn't tells you that your Bluetooth is connected as compared to other types.But overall review is good .And don't push the speaker dust Cap .keep away from kids,5
"Awesome Product By Zebronics and Amazon Sound Quality is Superb Loudness is Average But Bass is More Than i Expected. Overall its a Best and Value for Money Product under 3000 rupees. Go for it Blindly. I Brought it for 2,299 rupees in Amazon special price drop offer.",5
I just loved this product at 2K. It's an awesome buy at this price. Look wise very good... Loved the finish n highlight was changing colors. Very easy to connect n use. Manual given along doesn't give a detailed information though. The quality of sounds also gr8. Even at volume 8-10 gives a high sound. Easily plays music from my mobile phone via Bluetooth. Remote given is decedent.,4
"1) It was delivered before one day, than it was expected.

2) If Indian products are so nice and awesome why we should go with other products. It is really very nice. Sound is awesome. At this price range this is the best. Truely speaking just got for it.. Everything is perfect.
3) The sound is clear.
4) Quality is good and led is very attractive.
5) Bass is also good.
Infact, everything is better than expected.
6) There is a space for improvement in the wires, it would be a bit long.

Thanks Zebronics (Proud to use products made in India)",5
Best in this price range ...superb base quality ..i think this is the best home thetere in market in this price range ..sufficent sound for atlest 50 feets...good job Amazon..thnq so much .....delivered before 4 days before delivery date ...,5
Very good product at this price level and not complain. Good packing and delivered on time. Decent output for a big hall. Suitable for home and office. Well designed with all cables including a remote control.,5
"I bought this product in June 2020, but just after a month 2 of the audio output ports stopped working.
Now I am managing with the remaining 2 ports.
Although the sound quality, Bass , Woofers are really good. The only issue is with the quality of RCA ports, which are of very cheap quality.
Also, it shows 1 Year warranty but customer has to visit the service center, and sadly there is only 1 in entire Bangalore city, which is too far to travel.
To summarize, I wouldn't recommend, as buying this product is just a LUCK, as how long it will sustain has not guaranty.",1
Surround sound is working... but with AV cable.. not expect too much!,5

Bass is good.bluetooth connectivity is so fast and sound quality super from mobilr. working great with my led tv with cable. Great product in this price range,5
Excellent,5
Very happy with the product. Value for money. Fulfills a basic poor man's home theatre. Have not found any issues. Except that a minor fine tune with how device works would have helped. Every time the product is switched on the volume plays at highest and you bring it back down every time. Which will be annoying,5
"I purchased to this just 10 ago.

"Wow that's amazing in this price üòç , we are loving it .",5
I bought it in 2018. Still works very well. Sound quality is also very good. It is a good product in this price range. Remote controller is still working! That is a very good thing. Even remote controllers of big brands are not so long lasting. If you are a bass lover definitely it is worth buying. Remember one thing it is not an extra ordinary product. You will get a nice product in reasonable price.,4
Good product,5
This product has amazing 'sound Quality' nd the volume control is verry good.... And it connects... Very fast....,5
"First I have some doubts about bass and sound quality .cos it's cheap in price.

Everything working perfect .bt, aux,FM, pendrive,card reader.and remote.
Perfect for low budget music lovers.",5
Paisa vasool music system.kids enjoying the sound quality and easy to use with remote option.Loved it.,5

Go with it without any doubt. Best speaker in this category,5
"We got these set of speaker in the month of october last year. I wanted to check how long and how well it maintains it's quality and then post a review. I must say it's one of the best buys so far. Awesome sound quality, bass is too good. I good this at 3k which is way too cheap for a product with such a nice quality. Budget friendly and quality product. Too satisfied!",5
Good music system sound quality is good volume control is good Bluetooth connectivity is good overall price is good thanks zebronice,5
Very nice product bass is too good according to price working well,5
Sound quality is best bass is good not best and the product quality is best I liked it but one thing I want to say that it does not have bass control button then also product is good,5
"Great perchase of first time.Sound is great .it has classic look.i am so glad.üòäüòä ..But there is something missing,it has not bass controller... overall good.. mostly recommending to buy this one!!",5
Awsm sound quality n bass is also great . Go for it you will not regret for your spending,5
This is a very good product in this price range. I was looking for some less cost speakers but I got a home theater. I highly recommend the zebronics speakers.,5
If your budget is low as me. Go for this product and you will be amazed to hear the sound quality. Got it for 2200 and best using it from 2 years. Now planning to go for zebronics again for an expensive product.,5
Bass is not that good. But over all it‚Äôs a good product. Go for it,5
Descent product,5
"I did lots of research to purchase a good home theater ar reasonable price and this product is the BEST. Even at high volume sound is very clear.
Don't hesitate you can go for it. It's a.quality product from Zebronics. Thank you!! üòä",5
"Sound is great but bass is just gud. Product is ok. You can't change bass and treble from main deck. And also there is no equalizer settings for aux. Equalizer will work only in USB and MMC. Sound output is above average. Good product quality. Dancing LED on main deck is attractive.
Delivery from Amazon is on time. Took another 1 day for delivery after they promised. With bluetooth we can modify the audio with punchy bass and less vocal or instrumentals. The 4 inch bass box surprises you in 80% of volume but at higher volumes it can't reach the peps.",5
"Superb sound quality üî•üî•üëå .
I loved it very much.Thank u Amazon",5
Value for money üí∞,5
In this price i brought a small jbl Bluetooth speaker which is no where comparable to this bass monster..,5
"Very nice bass
Very nice sound quality
Very nice connectivity
Overall best home theaters under 3000
üòçüôÇüôÇ
I love it",5
"Excellent, I bought one each for my boys and they are loving it. The volume is great and our hall fills up when it plays. Bass and treble perfect for listening and occasional party mood. Bluetooth connectivity is perfect and I can carry my mobile around home while it plays.",5
Very nice,5
Best buy in this price and trustworthy in terms of durability as I am writing this review after 4 years of purchase.,5
"This is a amazing product but sounds is little bit low when I play song using bluetooth. But after using external Sound Booster, this speaker became beast... Definately, this is a value for money product...",5
"Best product. Awesome thumping and clear bass. Only con is that bass control is not there, but you can use your PC or mobile equiliser to control bass. Close your eyes and buy. Definitely value for money.",5
The best choice among 5.1 sound system within the Budget for Crispy sound and a great Bass. Love it.,5
Within few month remote stopped working worst brand don't buy,2
It's ok for small size room. Sounds quality is OK in this price segment.,5
"Super awesome Speaker
Bass is ok
treble is ok
usb supporting finely
clear sound
Stylish design light in sub woofer
Thanx zebronics",5
Awesome product. The bass is coming like a killer. The sound quality is also very nice. Only one thing is missing that is the bass controller but the sound is very balanced with the bass limit. So i am not going to miss the thing.,5
Superb product in this price range.Seperate Bass and treble control is missing.Only volume control.Nice bulid quality and premium loook.,5
"As in user guide given not to use USB slot for charging any electronic devices,ignore that warning and tried to charge my phone,after few minutes the main unit starts heating up and gives burning smell.
But till now there is no problem!!",5
Almost 2 years n no complains yet.. Working smoothly.. Compact n beautiful.. Beautiful music.. Had a complain immediately after delivery.. N amazon replaced a new one.. Thank you for considering..,5
Everything is good but the wires.must be given a more.length,5
classy system.... 1st time received without remote but thanks 2 amazon replaced old into new,5
"Zebronics products are use and throw, they are VFM. Have decent performance, good till they last and reasonably priced.

But they last only for a few months post warranty expiry.
This is my second such experience, I bought this in July 2017and this one's gone in may1029.
Earlier I had zebronics Bluetooth handy speaker and that too died after 1.5yrs...

Enjoy till it lasts",2
Excellent product sound is okey bluetooth connectivity is good but bass is not up the mark,5
"Great product, noise is sufficient to home . Radio,aux , speaker are good .best bass are given",5
Happy with the purchase.Clear loud sound. Good Bluetooth connectivity. Looks also good. I recommend it.Thanks,5
Good sound for 10x12 room size.,5
"I liked the sound quality
But there is no any button for bass control
With BT connectivity the sound is more
The aux cable and satellite wires are small size
My aux cable is damaged",5
Good product,5
"As usual, I read all the reviews, both positive and negative before buying this. But thought of trying my luck as I believe in Zebronics products. quick delivery by Amazon. overall great performance at this price range. Bass and Treble are good. bluetooth is working even through abstacles and the phone is not in straight line with speakers (tested from other room). Volume is sufficient enough for 2 BHK flat. Remote is working well. They are providing remote without batteries, we need to buy them seperately. There is No Bass control, which is something negative I can say.",5
IT WAS AWESOME AND SOUNDS INCREDIBLE..,5
These speakers and really worth every penny spent. Sound quality is amazing and they connect literally in no time. Amazing product.,5
"I like this product sound quality and bass is ok because what you want in ‚Çπ3,000.Almost this product is best in this budget.",5
"Nice home theater, cheapest price rate.Good sound quality. Fast delivery. Thank you seller & Amazon.",5
"Sound qualities was so good but they missed to add the Equalizer control (jazz, bass, rock)",5
Super sound quality,5
Worth buying,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Thak you Amazon this product is very nice",5
bluetooth connectivity not good but product is superb...sound quality is very good,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Good sound",5
"Very fast delivery
Sound quality is very best......over all everything is best....thanks amazon",5
"I am not really satisfied with the product, but it costed me only 2300 bucks I can't be too harsh on this. Actually it is quite good for listening music but of your re watching a video or a movie, vocals aren't very clear, words are just muffled and your are not able to understand the dailouges. Mostly it is due to the subwoofer, as the bass can't be turned off it just keeps beating even when bot needed and that destorys the vocals.
Bass is really good though, real treat for bass lovers. But wierd thing is, it just starts beating anywhere, sometimes in really sad scenes üòÇüòÇ.

There is also some problem with Bluetooth, it disconnects and reconnects automatically while playing (but this is just problem with my unit).

But you won't get a better speaker for this price, so if you have a tight budget go for it.

Reviews after 4 months of use ‚ò∫Ô∏è",3
"Superb Bass and Sound Quality
I love it üòçüòç",5
"Best product under budget great volume nice design but only one thing which disappointed me is it's cable, ox and satellites cable build quality it is some poor but ignore it best product under budget everyone should buy this",5

"I did purchase it in 2018 , The seller already delivered me defective product first time , The product was all broken from outside and inside , Now talking about the audio quality of this product,
Sound :- 2/5
Bass - 2/5
Build Quality - 3/5
Overall You'll not be satisfied on this speaker if you're yourself an audio lover like me , I bought it for 1.8K and next day I sent the product back to amazon and luckily I got the refund .",1
"VOICE QUALITY IS GREAT, THEY LOOK AWESOMELY BEAUTIFUL. HOWEVER THEY HAVE NOT A VERY GREAT BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY (THAT IS BIT UNDERSTANDABLE AT THIS PRICE.)",5

Great product reached on time and wonderful service üëç",5

"Awesome product in lowest cost

"Perfect Bluetooth 2.1 speaker, must buy product from zebronics. Good bass and terable preset, no option to reset. But that doesn't matter, we can set from player. I can play my cell phone songs from any part of my flat with ease. Thanks Amazon for dispatching before time with complete safety.",5
I have ordered this second time for my other residence after using over 3 months. Best product at this price. Sound quality is too good. Volume control and loudness is high enough to play for household parties and get-together.,5
It works like normal average music system with average base and sound quality. But it is great at this price. Works fine..,5
"If you are looking for good quality speakers and whooper, then just go with this one. The sound quality is super awesome, this set can turn your home into a dance floor very easily and very  Zebronics BT4440RUCF 4.1 Channel Bluetooth Speakers quickly too",5
"I'm buying this one so nice sounds quality üëåüëç but this product value was rs-2699
Now showing-2490 but I'm Happy nice home theater thanks Amazon üòäüòò",5
Awsome speakers since 7months speakers working super. Blindly go for it this price range.,5
"I got this for 2300 and it's worth paying it. Best speakers under 2500. Just go for it. But their was little crack at the back side of my remote, but it's ok. The speaker was delivered in the company box only, Amazon didn't package it. Otherwise it was ok.",5
Too good in this price ...,5
"I buy it for 2k, its worth more than that!
Sound quality is good.
best speakers I currently have at this price range.
Phillips, Sony never provide such quality at these price range.",5
"Every features in this is awesome, Bluetooth connectivity is good and it is worth for my money.",5
"Sounds good.
Adequate bass.
Treble was good and not distorted.
Fm radio works just fine.
Overall value for money!",5
I have been using this for 2 days and the performance is just mind-blowing. This is perfect for a small room. The Bass is just quite a lovely throw. Bluetooth streaming is good too. If u need a System which can stream with 2.5K budget then u can go ahead without any hassles. Lot of pros but just to mention it doesn't have a Bass Controller but has EQ which can be controlled.,5
"Bought it on 4/10/2017. Writting this review after 3 years (i,e.17/10/2020) üòÅ. Just to appreciate the Zebronics product quality at an affordable price.
About the home theatre,
Good sound quality. I only use this to listen music through bluetooth. Bluetooth range is only around 15feet. Base is good.
Good for 10*15 room. ( I tried this with led t.v , it worked pretty good).
Overall worth the price.( I came across this product on Great Indian sale, I'm writing this review to help whoever planning to buy this)",4
Awesome bass and sound clarity is very nice and worthy for money,5
I liked the product it has wonderful sound quality. I liked especially it's Bluetooth support. The only problem is that it does not offer to change the bass according to requirements. But overall i loved the speakers,5
"DO NOT BUY THIS if looking for a home theatre.
THERE IS NO REFUND POLICY ON THIS PRODUCT. You can replacement BUT CANNOT RETURN.
NO BASS at all. Music volume is okay
It's a typical computer speakers, good for listening music if you are connecting through a PC or a laptop.",2
"Sound quality is great. There is no bass control so you cannot set bass to high or low. All you can set is the master volume.
Bluetooth connectivity is decent. You can play music from your phone using BT option.
Earlier the item delivered had issues and sound and bass was really bad. So if you get such a delivery please ask for replacement as it would be a defective piece. The item delivered as replacement was good and the sound is really nice and bass is also decent. Overall it's a good product in this price range and good for home usage.
Radio is also good has good antenna, just that setting and saving the channel is a task.
Can connect to computer but the cable provided with the box to connect the woofer to the CPU is really small.
Overall the product is great and the sound is very clear and you would love to listen to the songs on this system. Connect your phone and enjoy the songs.",4
It's awesome...I'm using if for 2 years and it's really awesome...not a single problem yet.. worth the price,5
"It's been 5 years and the speaker is still working fine. I was not sure to buy this one because I was not sure of the brand. However after using this product almost everyday, from the time it was delivered; I would definitely recommend it to everyone. The sound quality and base is also more than enough at this price range. The only issue is that they have a volume controler but no base controller...",5
"Zebronics 4.1 audio system is very good product in its class. Excellent sound quality. The major defect i found is with FM receiver. No clarity in FM.Very poor reception. I live in city area with more than 5 FM station reception. Another defect is lack Trible - Bass controller in base set and in remote. The FM reception problem was already i faced with another Zebronics product in another locality. So i think the zebronics authorities should should address the issue immediately for their products. Apart from that this product is excellent and worth for money you spent.
Also this time i got this product delivered by INDIA POST and not say a pathetic delivery experience with lack of packing, careless handling, packet opened and worst behavior.",4
I bought for 2567Rs when USB mode sound basse awesome for price aux and. Bluetooth sounds low,5
Tooo good product really I can't believe it really sounds good unbelievable product in this price we can easily buy this product with out any doubt,5
It looks sleek and it works good. sound clarity is good. using it at a commercial place and it serves the purpose. nice product. go for it.,5
"Superb purchased, Easy to connect to the Bluetooth,aux and led TV's , very good bass, and led colour lighting",5
just go for it..if your bauzet is low for music system or supporting TV sound theater ...really good...,5
"Good product
Sound is awesome
But bass adjuster is not available",5
Display not showing and also not working audio system. Bluetooth device not working.,5
"Over all I am happy with the sound quality, you only get what you pay for so that way it‚Äôs value for money. But the buttons on the woofer doesn‚Äôt work properly you have to try multiple times also batteries not included for the remote, not a deal breaker but it has become a common custom to include batteries as part of your purchase.",4
"Awesome product
I really like it ,
Good for one who is having limited budget",5
Sound clarity is damn good,5
Best product at this price. The subwoofer is very powerful. The sound quality is also good.,5
"Product is ok. You can't change bass and treble from main deck. And also there is no equalizer settings for aux. Equalizer will work only in USB and MMC. Sound output is above average. Good product quality. Dancing LED on main deck is attractive.
Delivery from Amazon is worst. Took another 2 days for delivery after they promised.",3
Very good produced,5
"The two accessories are missing. About the sound quality, center speaker's performance is not good as there is some external buzzing sound when the volume increases. The box is also broken, it maybe during the shipping. It's better to take some measures during the packing in order to avoid breaking during shipping.",1
"Remote broken condition otherwise over all good
Please check before packing",5
Supbb üëåüëå,5
"This is one of the best music system for home use.. boss is little much low and not controlled by us it's in constent position..over all the sound clarity is very good and this price range you will get everything like Bluetooth,USB, Memory card, Aux don't think too much just go for this.",4
"Still my product is not receive
I am replacement my order because
Before product not working",5
It is very good product. Sound quality is very good. Must buy speakers list ..,5
all are okay..but the most important thing is there are one speaker may be not working... i am not sure about that.....let's see ...,5
"Under 3k,it's nice product.sound quality it's so good and handy product.",5
Very good product at this price good for small room.,5
The connecting wires from the woofer to speakers must have been a little longer. 4m atleast,5
"This is really not a good product. There may be 2 reasons either the quality compromised or a fake product received.
First one was handled badly by courier partner. Sir there are too many dents. On woofer body also sleeker are dented in front.
Second which I have received after 4 days stopped working. There is no display only getting sound of switch on and switch off.
Really very baad experience with this shopping.
Thank you now will return today to courier partner.",1
"A great product for the price. Does it's job pretty well. Bass is isn't that loud and thumping but that's acceptable for the price. Got it for Rs2300! Loudness is great (60W RMS). VOCALS are great. Its easy to use, bit less durable but sound is amazing. The remote I received was cracked and the packaging by the seller wasn't good. I have already given a feedback regarding this to the seller. The system however managed to get delivered in working condition.
To sum up, it's a great system that would fulfill your most demands. Remember, it's a budget music system.",4
"Initially I got a product where the remote was not working then exchanged it. The exchange time is very quick and really appreciate Amazon for this.
About the product... Sound quality is good. Worth for money.",5
"I am writing this review after using it for 4 months. Based on my experience initially, I had returned this thinking this as defective but second unit was same again.

What is good?
1. Sound is really very loud for playing indoor.
2. A good product at this price range.

What can be improved?
1. Bluetooth connectivity and connection strength. Signal drops and it feels you are streaming something with slow internet.
2. When power cuts, it by default resets to maximum volume.
3. Sound has distortion while playing at maximum volume.
4. Aux cable is just 1 meter.
5. Sound quality is better on BT than aux cable though it should be same.
6. Remote doesn't work even at the distance of 4-5 meter. You need to go very close to the speaker.

Should I buy this?
Yes, if you have budget constraints and can't invest additional 2-3K. Buying this product at 3K is not a bad deal.

Bottom line:
Add 2K more in your budget and go for another product for better sound experience.",3
"Sound quality great, bluetooth connectivity is average but manageable if there is no obstacles in between.
I will say one thing for this price it is best. Vocal and bass are balanced. You will not feel any distortion even when volume is high. So if any one willing to purchase in this price range, simply go for it. You will not regret.",4
Good product and good quality of product and excellent quality???,5
"I wanted to give 4.5 *.
Excellent product in this price. Only remote control is not powerful. You have to use remote in specific direction. Except remot's power, it is extremely good product. Delivery was very fast.",5
"I am using it from 2 weeks and i felt that the item is worth buying from bass quality to the loudness all things arw excdllent. What i felt quite negative is its wires, the wires seems too thin to provide more flexibility but on the same it seems quite weak. So, anyways thumbs up for this item a very good purchase that i made so far",4
"Bhai aakh band kar ke le le is price me sabse mast home theater hai
Bhai full aawaj me v bajane se kuch nhi hota aur mai apne home theatre ko sam ke 6 baje se 9 baje tak full aawaj me daily bajata hu fir v mast work kar raha hai
Nice... Product
Thanx Amazon",5
Sound quality and Bluetooth speaker very good üëç,5
"Writing review after using for a month. I am fully satisfied with the performance at this price range. Sound quality is excellent, bluetooth connectivity is also good except on a few occasions, have to connect manually with TV else it connects automatically when TV is 0pp plugged on. Range is quite excellent, it works when sitting in different room.",4
"It's a good product for those just would like to have a speakers set 4.1 for listening to music through BT, Sd, usb AUX and FM.. bass is less.. but it's not my purpose.. just listen to favorite songs and FM",5
"Very low sound quality!
'BASS' & 'TREBLE' quality is very low standard!
Sound 'CLARTY' also not good!
There is no separate control for 'BASS' & 'TREBLE'.!
Only it's can play with loud volume but you won't feel like 'Home Theater' .!!
---------
Now within two months.. RL speaker connection from Woofer STOP working!!",1
I received my package on 7 January 2019 after ordering on 6 January 2019. I like the speaker and sound and everything is good. But when I looked at the remote it was broken. The photo is proof. I bought the item from Appario Retail Private Ltd. I don't have the time or energy for replacement so I have to live with it. Please be careful while buying this product.,3
"West quality & west sound, Hi-Fi Bluetooth connectivity, waste volume",5
"No bass control. Volume control is so messed up when connected through Bluetooth. Aux at high volume gives out a humming noise.
LR and RR speakers stopped working in 6 months. Even after service center repaired it, the same issue occasionally pops up.

I fitted the RL and RR speakers at the corners of my room using good quality RCA cable extenders. But the sound coming out is those two is very low. Also note that these are not surround speakers.

The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is due to its low price point.",3
The overall system is average.... Sounds and bass are also average.... Bt the delivery system are poor... The men who deliver this to me this morning are so careless.... The stored this system very carelessly.. As a result the remote broke up..... Bt not fully damaged its working after I install batteries in this.... One more drawback is that they don't provide battery for the remote... Other wise it's good under this range.... Better than expected.... I was very confused to buy music system.... After many research I found this one.. Hopping will fulfill the expectations... And it does...... If you are also willing to have a home theatre under 2.5k... You can go with it... Surely it will stand on your expectations.... Bt the delivery men should be careful....... Thnks,4
This is the best one comparing to money,5
Very good device at the price. I paid ‚Çπ2999 for it. Looks stylish with the design and lights. Bass output is quite good. The voice is not that clear. Will be very useful if you want to listen to hard music. Not so useful for watching daily soap on tv.,4
Sounds super,5
Very nice product with higher sound But without satellite speakers it sound is low and sound is not clear üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüî•üî•üî•,5
Impressed me....4.1 is powerful and all functions work perfect....bass is pretty amazing...and beautiful design and built quality...led is also okay... decent and best,5
"Surprisingly stopped working on 1st day only. Can't believe Amazon is selling all faulty products. Bellow avarage product, sound quality is acceptable but the volume control is a complete disaster. Quality of the plugs and wires are terrible. Bluetooth connectivity is old version but still works. My suggestion would be invest a little more and get atleast brands like Phillips or Sony.",1
"Got it for 2499 during Independence day sale.
Amazon took 8 days to dispatch it and delivered it the 10th day (worst delivery experience till date.)
The product came in the original Zebronics packaging.
The sound quality was OK.
I would say OK because it was not very good as a 4.1 channel speaker should be.

Pros:
RGB lights look beautiful.
Bluetooth connectivity is good.
The sound is loud enough.
The speaker's cable length is more than 1mtr each.

Cons.
The woofer doesn't have a bass controller.
There were no batteries for the remote.
The small speaker's sound is not loud enough hence the bass overtakes the trebles.

Now the problem begins
I was not satisfied by the quality so I decided to return it and optend for a refund.
The pickup date was 5 days late so I thought I can listen till the pickup date.
BUT the speaker stopped working the same day while listening to music.
Only the RGB lights were on, the display / indicator didn't even turn on again.
That was a DEFECTIVE ITEM.",3
Nice product for the price... Actually using it for a month. No problem so far. The sound quality is good not great and the look too... It's sad that there is no knob to control bass and treble... The sub woofer itself is not pumbing enough bass... The FnD 2.1 I had earlier was producing more thumbing bass than these ones... Another downside is the aux input... its terrible! Don't know whether its with the cable or the system... Bluetooth is working fine.. i would say the sound quality is better when connected via Bluetooth... The system could have included a memory function so that every time when we switch on the system It goes to the previously used input.... Unfortunately its going to aux input every time we switch on the system.... Remote included is pretty good... Usb/sd input is working fine but the Radio is not working for me... I have tried a lot of time but not getting any channels. Overall an avg speaker system producing a good sound with below avg bass....,3
"This is very small,not like what you in pic, like the ones you got earlier with your desktop PC. Sound quality, not good,looks wise cheap, speakers not proper working, in aux mode, only two rt speakers work.no on off from front. Highly overpriced, low in quality and performance. You cannot return it, you to bear with it and repent over it , thanks to Amazon.",2
"Best budget speaker, good packaging by Amazon. Timely delivery. Decent bass and sound clarity good.",5
Worthable product in zebronics just 2500 ... Sounds quality's very good ... Bass ultimate ...,5
Best Sound quality,5
"Previous speaker where faulty. Non of the port cable we're fitting properly. Thus asked for replacement. The replacement arrived in just 2 days. Thanks to Amazon for super fast delivery.
I am happy with my 2nd parcle. The speaker where in good condition.. working well..good sound and bass.. overall value to money.

Deducting 2 star for sending defauled speaker.. else would have given 5 stars.",3
"Wow.. Excellent Bass, Sound Quality Also Good.. This is 5star rating item Fr9m Zebronics..",5
Excellent,5
Bad,5
"The packaging and build quality is good. The colour lights seems like an aberration, since I am trying to watch movie in dark room. The sound quality is below par. The dialogue is not clear, even with good audio stream like from a fire stick. I verified the audio works well in other systems for the same video. The digital display is avg. It displays input mode and volume. All the 4 speakers have same length cord. I feel the back speakers should have longer cord.
Over all it is a very average product at affordable price.",3
"Medium range speaker with Bluetooth feature; for a good price. Loved it . Quick delivery too . Thanks AmaZon
I bought it a year back and it still works fine .",5
Worth it,5
"1. I am not a audio nerd by any standards. For me its sounds about right for what I expected.
2. I mainly use it while watching movies in home theater projector. Connected directly through the 3.5mm Jack.
3. Also used to hear FM station, which it had no trouble picking up.
4. Remote works well and the led light is also good.",4
Nice looking speaker and nice sounds and bass loud sound very powerful sound thanks to sellers and amazon,5
One of the best in class product worth for money in this segment. Sound quality is awesome and looking good.,5
Remote on off facility not avelable bluetooth same time more not connect sound quality is good,5

Zebronics BT4440RUCF 4.1 C is OK (not good) product on this mony.
When I collected this package and opened it and set up for music I noticed that one speaker doesn't work.",4
Speaker is awesome but started making humming/buzzing sound from all the four speakers. Customer Support is very bad. They don't have troubleshooting techniques and the service center is just want to make money. I would not recommend this product.,1
"Good product but, plz check them finally inspections.",5
"All good, like sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity is so quick.",5
SD card not supported 36 GB of video,5
it has superb sound quality and nice punchy bass,5
Mind blowing product mind blowing sounds base everything loved it worth buying it smart look good Bluetooth connectivity loved it,5
"Poor quality product!!!
Don't buy it!!!
Total waste of money!!!
The woofer stopped working after 15 days of purchase,bluetooth doesn't work.
Just the woofer light turns on when plugged in.
There's no information anywhere about where to get it fixed from even though the product has one year warranty.
What is use of this warranty I wonder.
I don't think there's anyone to solve and look into this matter.

Highly disappointed.",1
"Good product . Bass control is automatic, not much feel the bass but you never expected the bass quality at this price. If you are a bass lover then this one is not met with your expectation.",4

"The sound quality is ok, a minute after I plugged it has a very bad noise even in stand by mode then I thought it has some defect and replaced it with amazon the service from amazon is quite good and impressive a 2nd day I got the replace by another. But surprised me the 2nd one also the same problem IS IT NORMAL? or I got bad luck? twice.",1
Very good,5
Offers excellent sound quality for the price. The bass improves as you use the product. Good overall product.,5
Good,5
"Good speaker. Provides reasonable bass and treble. Only problem is the volume, when switched on. The volume automatically goes to full when you switch on. It does not save the volume that is set. If your volume controller from other device such as firestick is already high, then when switched on you will get a unbearable huge sound output all of a sudden which is pathetic.",4
"Very Good product,",5
This product is very good.,5
Good product...!! Awesome sounds... Perfect bass sound with high volume..!!! thanks to zebronics.... ‚ú®,5

I got a same day delivery. Thanks to amazon. But it was a defective product. Input button in the subwoofer was not functioning. I got a replacement by Amazon within 3 days.

Best 4.1 home theater speaker sound quality is excellent but bass is average bluetooth connectivity is very good remote quality is below average everything is fine but not for hall purpose worth for money üëç,4
"When I press the input mode change buttons on speaker or the remote there are only three options
AUX, Bluetooth and FM.. but no option for USB and SD card selection. So even if there is ports for USB and SD cards no option to select it.
Is anyone there facing the same problem?",2

‚ò∫",4
Sure you won't get anything better than this in this price. I'm loving the sound.,5
"While this is a good value for money system. It has some shortcomings.

a) Expected at least a bass increase decrease knob. A good system has two knobs to change bass and treble.
b) Sounds bit low for such a 4 box system.",3
This product is awesome I like this product,5
God to buy,5
"Good sound quality, axe cable connection sound is normal, Bluetooth sound effect is good",4
I am writing this after 3 years of purchase. Overall performance is good the connectivity of bluetooth is a bit low it's around 5-6 meter.,4
"Not good for instrumental, different instrument sounds blend together and are not heard distinctly. sound distribution amoungst the speakers can be better, good base,EDM and rap sounds good besides disturbances at max volume (30) plays ok at 27-28. Can probably last 7 to 8 months if use with care(not sure just a prediction let's hope for the best(may later up to a year))
WORTH THE MONEY.
NOT FOR INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.",4
Ok for small room not for big party looks good i am using for movies and ps4 games,4

Superb speaker üîä,5
my buy price is 2k best product sound quality good at this price 4.1 with Bluetooth and remote control,5
The product is not satisfactory. It is a waste of money. The support team & SM team from Amazon does not even want to help..not even the leadership. They just read out the policies that the product will be replaced but it will not be refunded. What will anyone do with a replacement when they are not happy with the product..,1
It's an amazing product but the one thing lack is bass control its poor. At this price range it could have given better features . Atleast the bass should be powerful. But that the worst thing. Don't buy if you are bass lover. I love when everything near me vibrate it feels out of universe overall it's ok ok.,2
Very good sound quality glorry finished and the led light awesome,5

I like this home theatre very much. But i dislike that the remote is manufactured as the can be rise upto 30. But in speaker there is volume option which you can rise ahigher level of sound,5
Nice one for a room. Good bass. Worth for money. Fully satisfied in this price range as a music and movie sounds lover,5
Good Sound quality and surrounding. But sometimes it gets automatically disconnected from Bluetooth and have to connect it again.,4
Looking beautiful but sound quality is not so strong just average but value for money. Overall good product.,4
"It's amazing good woofer effect and good connectivity for Bluetooth, aux,usb, FM I'm also referred my friends good bass sound best price, best effect best connectivity I like zebronic speaker system",5
Very good sound output and overall worth buy,5
Happy to get this sound system in this price. Looks and finish is brilliant. Sound quality is good although not massive sound is generated. Smooth operation. Only thing that is missing is the manual bass/treble equaliser. The delivery by Amazon was a bit delayed due to dussehra. Overall I'm happy with this. üòÑ,4
It looks good. Vibrating lights. Moderate Amplifier. A bit expensive. The only cons is less volume than what was expected from in this price range.,4
"Its awesome...but sometimes when we connect bluetooth with mobile, it's disturbing and got struck like ghar ghar sound.
Some times it is getting disconnect automatically when we pause the song.",4
These are the best bluetooth speakers in this price range excellent bass and good bluetooth range. Got these @2099!! Thank u amazon,5

No need to think twice before buying .",5
Delivered all the features as promised. Good product.Sound quality is also good. May be would have been little louder.but overall its all ok. Bluetooth connectivity with remote.Best for domestic use.,4
Today I received this product.thank you Amazon for the lesser price and super fast delivery.i got it at 2099.best speaker under this range. satellite speakers cord must be a little long as it is too short.zebronics must carefull about this.over all product is awesome.,5

"worked well for 2 years now suddenly has stopped working. Bluetooth is not connection ,neither is the auxiliary system working. A big letdown",1
"Worked well for a few days but only after a month the display disappeared. No function is working. Its not more than a black box occupying a corner of my room. Waste of money. No column of replacement. What do I do of it now. Cant even be used as a paper weight. terribly disappointed on its choice, should have gone for a better brand.",1
Using it from last 4-5 months. They are loud and clear. Connects well with phone and plays seamlessly. Decent for open air listening or for a small party on roof top.,4

"Worth for price range around 2.5 k to 3k but It‚Äôs an average product is what I feel. Sound quality is very poor. Seems durable but doesn‚Äôt suit for big rooms. If you are a person who likes Base and more sound quality, don‚Äôt go for this.",3

"The speakers are really good enough for a normal home. Sound is high. No adjustment for equalizer settings. Only volume up/down. FM is ok. Bluetooth connectivity works fine with mobile phone.

Bass is not up to the mark. Won't recommend anyone. I was planning to buy F&D or Philips but bought this after seeing good reviews. It is OK ok but not up to the mark. Zebronics has a long way to go. Sound clarity is good but bass and beats are terrible.,1
I would like to give it 5 star ... Superb sound n bass is good ... But satellite speakers cables are too short in length .. hardly 1 metre .. and the quality of aux cable is very cheap,3

You can play songs directly from your smart phones. In VFM, I will give it 5*. Design, 4*. Sound quality, 4*. Some songs like Naina from Dangal sound superb on this. Dance floor songs should be best played at medium volume. High volume doesn't sound good.

Zebronics should have provided long extension cables for the 4 satellite speakers. The default ones are really small.",4

"Exquisite Sound experience under 3K friends seriously...!
Awesome music with 4.1 sound production.
Following are supported-
Bluetooth, FM, USB, AUX, SD Card.

Rating:
Bass: 8.5/10
Treble: 9/10
Overall Music: 9/10

A must buy product...

Delivery and Packaging also very good by Amazon.",4
"For the Price this is a compact and clear audio device , there is not BASS adjustment , but its set just perfect, fit for small rooms , Bluetooth pair works well with iphone , one plus 3T , no complaints - have not tested the USB and SD , not sure if I will use it as BT works fine.
Delivered on time without damage - as always with Amazon.

For Small rooms and if not interested in manipulation via equaliser - its worth the money.
If you have small kids you should know that the speakers are all exposed partially , so if they push a pencil or pen on it , they will tear, so either keep it up on a shelf or avoid with Kids below 3-4 yrs",5
"Sound is good and base is more than I expected (not comparing with JBL or Creative though). Using it with my LED TV with HD STB and can experience a better feel than TV's inbuild audio system. it got a fair BT range, but sometimes it make some pairing issues (like device not showing or cannot pair) but rebooting solves it generally. Sound quality in better in BT, USB & SD card slot compared to FM or AUX i/p (that's obvious), initially sound didn't crack in the top volume which is quite high, but after almost 3months of use now i can feel bit cracking of sound in the higher range, that too negotiable. hope it wont increase it time. FM got an antenna that's a great feature but I am not getting a good FM reception may be due to the placement of the product. 1 problem I encountered was the defect in the 7segment display. A part of one of the 4 seven segment displays malfunctioned from the day 1 but I didn't want to change the entire product for this minor problem. Remote is a good option for these type of systems and its remote is good too even it got equalizer option for different genre. Another problem i feel that it does not remember its digital sound settings once its powered off and will start on the maximum possible sound output with respect to the analog sound knob's position. Overall if you are negotiable with these minor flaws and don't expect these 2000bucks speakers to be comparable with that of Bose then you can definitely enjoy action movies on HBO or Star Movies in HD or can enjoy your favorite music over BT/USB/SD. Overall value for money!",3
"So, i write this review after use of 6 days. In this days i use this maximum time to check its performance. I satisfied very much from this product. Little bit issue of radio. Others system performance is very good.",4
"Having used them for 2 years, I was fond of the Intex speakers till last month. But I was blown away with these Zebronics speakers. It's light weight and subtle in design, but the output is amazing. Imagine a bose drum speakers for car, now this gives the exact same effect. It's a steal at this price as it also has bluetooth. I am enjoying the songs on FM as I write this review.
If there is a new version, I would like them to add a better display panel with more information. Also, I miss the manual bass/treble adjustments.",5
"Pros:
- Absolutely awesome sound. Quite powerful bass. Set it up with my TV in the living room and it sounds almost like a Dolby surround theater.
- Aesthetically pleasing. LED lights on the subwoofer is not overdone and would blend in very well in almost all scenarios.

Cons:
- Buttons on the unit are very plastic. Clicks loud and wobbles giving you a reminder of what you payed for it.
- Remote is also low quality and you have to press hard to register.
- FM antenna is super lame (A wire sticking out from the back). Picks up a lot of interference. Cannot leave it alongside other wires on the back, have to tie it upwards somewhere or leave it hanging out from the front to make it useful.
- All the connection wires could have been a bit longer. Power cable being uncomfortably short.

BUT WAIT!
The cons may be more in number than the pros but the quality of sound blows it all off (Literally man the BASS!) . In the end speakers are for listening to your media and frankly this one out does many Sony or Phillips 5-10k systems. Just set it up properly and enjoy the music.
Give it a thumbs up if it helped.
Cheers mate.",4
Overall This product is awesome and has a great sound but if you want to buy it then dont buy under one day delivery in amazon prime. I did so and was delivered a defective piece. First experience with amazon was unforgetable.,1
"The zebronics 4.1 multimedia speaker is a wonderful choice. Iam using it for more than 3 months.If you are a normal user then it's a good deal. I bought this during the lighting deal during the sale and it's really worth for every penny paid.
The Bluetooth features also works very well. However the cable which connects to the CPU is a bit short. Have to adjust accordingly.
As I said if you are a normal user and wants a good sound quality it's an excellent choice. Else we have to go for 5.1 of a good brand.
The customer support by zebronic was also good.
Good delivery by Amazon too.",5
There is no bass and treble controller and bass is not up to the mark but in 2200 rupees the best thing i ever buy,3
"12 September, 2017 ; 15:21
Im happy with this speaker but also very disappointed with this. I was planning to buy sony d100 but due to money problem i can't afford right now.
My friends, this speaker is very good for normal rooms either used in 2bhk. You can feel the bass in another room also.
Im unhappy bcz this speaker doesn't have bass/treble option but you can feel strong bass. And sound is okay for small rooms.
Looks is also good. So purchased 2remote batteries before receiving this speaker. Let's create boom boom boom boom to disturb our neighbours üëäüëäüòÇ",4
"the speakers are good, no doubt.......

i checked 6 diff brands out there comparing - features, sound quality, watts n price. all their prices were way-off... and they didn't have all the features

the only speakers with -> Aux, BT, USB, SD card, FM, Sound quality, 60 Watts, Equalizer mood - for this price is great.!!!!!!...grab it quickly before they increase the price.....i got this for 2600/- on amazon..(very sad)

I would also mention - i am not quiet satisfied with the Bass (8 out 10)",5
"Got at 2299/- For the Price its a Steal! Gives a Good quality audio, Aux , Bluetooth works Flawlessly, Fm. Good Bass and Stellar Clarity expected from a 4.1 Speaker.

Remote works Flawlessly too ..although you have to get the 2 AAA battery by yourself. Dts easily available at a local store

Had an F&D speaker which stopped working after 2 years that too was great but wanted to try something new... So thought about switching to Zebronics.

Made a Small to Medium sized room shake with its sound with correct pacement. Lol

And i am Glad now that I am Fully Satisfied and Happy. I would recommend this to Everyone at this price range of 2- 2.5 k.",5
"Speaker is fabulous. Bluetooth works like charm 10_ 15 m range, usb n fm work fine

I wish option like different music mode can be used in modes other than usb

I heard lot of people complaining about Bass.. let me clearly state that Bass is wonderful and is adequate for large room.. people says that Bass control knob is not present.. this is done purposely so that speaker adjust Bass accordingly and we don't have to worry..

I wish the aux cable and speaker cable would have been longer but that is issue with all electronics..

Got the product @ 2000 /- in great Indian sale",5
"Excellent Product. Decent seller. The first piece I received had a malfunctioning blue-tooth module. But the seller with Amazon's support replaced it promptly. The product is awesome for the price. If you are a user who wants to hear quality music but also respects your neighbor's freedom, then this is your product. If you are looking for a 'blast' and shake all around then move on. This product is loud and very clear with an even tone and well built with blue-tooth, SD slot, USB slot and radio. Its an all in one product. Install viper4windows or viper4Android and you get top value. These speakers gives maximum output with this tweak. Certainly value for money. Value against price 10/10. Go for it home users.

PS: Check blue-tooth as and when you get it. Change the input mode from button on the main unit to 'bt' and then scan. If your device recognizes this unit then you have a winner. The bt range is unbelievably good. But one minor drawback is, while the total volume offered is 30, with mobile you can manipulate only till 15. Still loud enough though. Enjoy your music folks. Cheers from a happy user.",5
"Its completely made outta cheap shiny plastic, all the wires are like yhe lowest guage possible but the sound is decent enough. Did not find any issues with Bluetooth within the room. Its pretty loud while playing with VLC and other players with sound enhancements but while watching online streaming audibleness quite poor (I fixed the speakers to the corners of my room, may be if you are keeping it near by it might be loud enough). Biggest drawback is it doesn't have any options to adjust bass n treble level, the remote does have a button - eq but i think its just for decorative purpose! Nothing happens. The sub woofer has a multi colored light and the color changes randomly, its kinda cool but it can't be turned off if you like your room to be dark in the night! (I haven't figured out how to turn that off, if anyone knows, pls let me know). Alos i have tried it with my mobile too (bith aux and Bluetooth) sound is clear and loud enough with some decent bass effect. Overall its pretty decent for the price range!",4
Product is fine for the price. Do not expect a lot as there is vibration noticed when you increase the volume. Bluetooth connectivity was questionable as both my android and iOS fails to connect complaining about incorrect PIN or passkey. But I raised a request online and received a call almost immediately from Zebronics. The issue is fixed! Appreciate the support,4

1.st Design :
It's a peice of art , Hight quality metrial , well designed and looking Cool , Made by wood , Color light in woofer looks good and changing automatically after some time (Not based on music) üëçüëç
2.nd sound :
Sound is awesome without any disturbance , Amazing music clearity with loud sound , Lower and upper beets reaily well balanced , No dout its produce Great Sound without any equalizer
3.rd Bass :
In term of Bass this is not justifying its price..
Am Not saying Bass was not good but seriously You have No control Botton.
So you need to control Bass via your equalizer

"Display got defected just after completion of 16 days of purchase.
My return policy is revised to 15days.

Very poor customer service of zebronics. The product is with service center from past 10 days.",1
"Product is good having rang Rs.2470, first time I received damaged product and put request for replacement, I receive the product with in 2 days. Sound quality is excellent, but no option to reset Bass & tribal it is in build, but sound quality is OK. If u want high bass u will have to manage from your mobile, it has Bluetooth to connect with mobile, no proper display to see the song playing on display, I am happy to have this product",4
"After using the speakers for about 4-5 days i am writing this on my experience..
Sound quality is very good...
Bluetooth connectivity is good...
If you use the speaker for 2-3 hours speakers start making annoying sound even when the music is paused...
Don't got the exact reason why it happened..
Now then i let the speaker to switch off for 1 hr then restarted the problem solved for the movement.. But after 1 hr speakers start making annoying sound again...
In this speakers i find everything absolutely fine apart from this problem.....
Now i am not able to use this speaker more than 1 hour it start making annoying sound...
Please focus on this problem otherwise trusted customers will start switching to other brands...",1
Very nice .. but 1time this product 1 speaker not working... But replacement coming very Nice ....by AK.prabhu,4

Treble - 4/5
Look - 5/5",5
"Sound 10/10
Bass. 10/10
Surround sound 10/10
Sufficient for hall area about 150
Bluetooth 10/10
Really monster sound
Thanks Amazon",5
"An awesome product for my 12x14 feet room. Although the speaker wire was too short and I had to install them in corner of my room, for that I recommend other buyers to buy RCA cables(female to male) to extend the wire.
Audio Quality: 9/10 (-1 for less bass)
Bluetooth Quality: 6/10 (coz it lags sometime and disturbs my wifi connection)
Radio: Do not work in my room(don't know why but since I don't need it so I don't give a damn)
USB Port: 10/10

Please note that once you're connected with your phone through Bluetooth you'll face issues while using wifi(can't say about data pack) like:
Slow Browsing
Buffering(Youtube)
Delay in whatsapp messages.

I bought this item for Rs.2000 and its totally worth it.",5
"Its 4.1 Speaker ...!
First Thing with in 2000 you cannot so much..

** THE BASS QUALITY IS NOT SOO MUCH GOOD...
*** BUT THE VOULUME , FEATURES , FUNCTION ARE THE GREAT THING OF THIS SPEAKERS ....!
if you are not high at bass...Then its Srtongly Recommened !

"In 5 days of purchase the DISPLAY had a defect. Please see the image, out of 4 letters, three had defect.",1
"Our neighbours relax when am not at home,,as I bought this sounds ,,superb bass and sound ,,,,I have my ears sunnnnn...Nnnnnn....When it plays bass booster check from you tube",5
Bought this product 3 months ago from amazon and still no issues with it. Really a good to have BT speakers at this price range.So far happy with it quality and performance.‚ò∫,4
"I did not expect this - I expected an average performer but this one exceeds all expectations. To put things into perspective, it matches my late 90's Sony system that was 90 watts RMS.

The sound quality is quite nice given the drivers have not broken in yet and would take at least 100 to 150 hours of play to start playing like it really should. I'm impressed.",5
"All positive reviews about the BASS are false. I'm keeping the product as it performs good enough for the price range. Bass is decent enough. My Onida TV has 10x better bass than these (Every glass in the room starts vibrating when i turn my TV bass ON)

Bluetooth, USB are all fine. Just a bit disappointed with the bass. Better go for Philips 2.1 in the same price range",3
"I got at 2100 and this is the best speaker you can get it has so many freaking features youll get tired counting.
Has a good wood frame on all speakers and woofer with a polished plastic looks great.
I use bluetooth volume is a bit low but for me it works fine not too loud .
I use it on tv and aux works fine.
With tv volume is fine again not too loud.
And finally this speaker has great bass.
Only problem as i said volume is a little less louder.",5
"Just bought this from Amazon. Packaging was fantastic. There was no chance that it could have damaged during the journey.
Now, coming to the speakers. The quality is fantastic. Sound is crisp and clear. Bass is very good and it turns on even the big rooms and halls into party places.
Connectivity
~USB (Pen Drive or SD Card via USB Card Reader), though there's a different slot for SD MMC.
~SD MMC
~Bluetooth
~And it comes with AUX cable with which you can connect it to anything that has 3.5 mm jack like TVs(that support 3.5 mm jack or if your TV doesn't have one you can buy wires that connect old TVs to 3.5 mm jacks)laptops, desktops, mobile phones, tabs etc.
Overall a must buy. I got it for 1999 during sale but I'd say that even for 3000 it's a fantastic buy as it connects to everything and sound is fantastic and bass is great...
Have a nice day..",5
Its really very nice sound system...at this cheapest price...i love it..but when I see it ..it is very small. I mean..its not middle size...it is small size sound system..but when I remember it's price...I get satisfied at this price...thank you!,4
"Awesome sounds, if the sub woofer speaker were placed at the bottom, sounds could be more vivid since due to vertical placement of the speaker, the diaphragm is vibrating up and down to some extend where for good quality sound it is supposed to vibrated strictly in the horizontal lining. Since it is practically tough to achieve it is always better to place the speaker in the bottom so that gravity can also help the sound to be produced more vividly.",4
"Brother...
u dont get better sound system in only 2099 than this one...
In last 1 month.. i searched for best sound system in 2K- 3k price range...
so after conclusion i go for this system... i ordered this on 12 aug and got today on 16 aug... and seriously in first impression i luved this piece of block buster sound..
some people in previous review said that bass and treble is not good... but in my opinion it has good bass and treble... and best in its price range...

BASS & TRBLE-
There is no any knob for bass and treble but u can adjust through playstore app and inbuilt mobile equaliser.. for me by default it has good bass and treble..

BLUTOOTH-
bluetooth range is limited to only one room... u cant operate from another room... but it has good range...
REMOTE: i dont use remote till now cz there is no cell given by the seller... lol...
FM: gud quality FM, if tower is in your locality..
Light in subwoofer is awesome... makes it very attractive..
So this is all that i analyses.... so go for it dosto...
[...] best of luck.",5
"It is an okay 4.1 system.
Cons:-
1. All speakers wires are of the same length. That means you have to place all the 4 speakers near the woofer. The wires length is approximately 2 feet.
2. Bass is not that deep. But OK for the price.
3. Remote has the equalizer button but it just does not work. I think they probably give a common remote with some of these kind of speakers and this specific model does not support the equalizer feature.
4. The supplied remote does not have the batteries. You'll have to buy them.

Pros:-
1. It has all the required features i. e. Aux, buetooth, memory card, pen drive and FM.
Also, the Aux cable can be found in the box.
2. The FM and the bluetooth features work fine.
3. The sound quality is acceptable. Total RMS is 60 W. Subwoofer is of 20 W and the satalite speakers are of 10 W each.
4. Max volume goes upto 30 and the sound is decent for a 10√ó12 room.",3
"THE Product brand win best multimedia speaker brand 2016 & Best speaker brand 2015

totally super product ,I will give 5/5",5
Sexy speakers for 2k on offer. Only drawbacks are length of the connecting wires of speakers and absence of bass control. Or else this will be the best in this price range. Audio quality and bluetooth connectivity both are working superb!!!,5
"The speakers have good sound and bass, but they cannot be placed separately in four corners. Doing so, distorts the sound. Otherwise, they sound really well. Using it with my TV. Bluetooth has good range. Purchased these in sale for 2000.",4
"Bass is awesome, but no bass control knob,so we have lower the volume , then the speaker wire is short u cannot hang the speakers , in four corners of the room, sound quality is nice!! Bluetooth range is just 5 mts from the device so it ll only suitable for small rooms , eg 10*10 ,12*12 rooms!! Note: speaker wire pin has to be pushed hard into the output socket , other wise u may think , this pin not suits the socket!! So insert it little hard ,till it enters the socket!!",4
"I purchase it 1799/- but sound is awesome, very clear and nice. you may connect with pendrive, cardreader,, bluetooth range super in my house I play and operate from top floor to 1st floor. I am really surprised its range near about 100 to 150 mtrs.. its fullfill my demand of sound on hd diveice or tv or hd movie sound, thanks, .....So don't worry, it s a best buy option, don't hesitate to purchase it not a single minute. Just wantch and buy.....best of luck..",5
I bought this speakers on 10-04-18 for Rs.2518. in this price segment it was ok in price and quality. Have pendrive and microsd slot. Not even i connect FM Still. Speakers Don't have any Nail slot to hang. You need to place it somewhere. Can't Hang in wall. Don't compare the product with Sony. It would be like BMW and Alto. Who need speakers for timepass musiq and not ready to spend more cost for Music System u can choose it.,4
"For a price under 2k, these speakers are pretty decent.

Pros:
1. Decent looking
2. Good quality sound
3. Plenty of features like bluetooth aux fm pendrive sd card slot.

Cons:
1. No, option to manually set a FM channel, you have to press scan and wait for it to automatically tune which is a lengthy process, and it ends up setting 30-35 channels while their are only 8 channels the rest are the frequencies in between.

I rated it 4 out of 5 as I received a damaged remote (It has a big crack on the back, though its still working)",4
"Good and clear sound without noise and distortion even at full volume. Woofer sound is also pleasing. Good finish. Good buy at the price offered at Amazon. Works with Blue tooth, computer, Pendrive, SD/MMC card, CD player, FM Radio ,volume enough for a 15x30 ft hall.",5
Fantastic product in this price good quality sound and high base .,5
"Speakers are good. nothing can be better in that price range.
Bluetooth is working perfectly when connected to my mobile.
I am using it with tv. And it is Good and clear.
Volume level is low just cover single room. So good for personal use. but has a good clarity. In that price range it is the best speaker.
Amazon service was also good. I got it on the same day of booking. That was a surprise for me.",4
"Nice packing .. design is good . Sound is pure and without any disturbance . Bluetooth connectivity is impressive. Bass is as gud as compared to these range speakers . Worth buy . Suitable to medium room . Only a bit of negative thing is ...Bass controller absent. With low volume , u can't expect bass as high and audible. High bass comes with high volume.
Otherwise it's gud to have such budget friendly speakers.",5
Ordered on 23rd Aug. Delivered on 27th Aug. Very happy to receive it so fast to a very remote location... the best product for this price... if u want all features at reasonable cost then go for it...,5
"The product is good and bluetooth functions well but the sound is very less and there is no bass and treble control,so you cant increase the bass and treble...Though I have got it yesterday, so its too quick for me to give a complete review.But the sound is not up to the mark as I thought and is very low compared to the same ranges intex or other music system",3
There is a noise coming from the speaker all the time. And the more time the speaker is turned on the noise is increased. It makes it very unpleasant. Unfortunately this started after three weeks. And my return window was closed by that time. So I am not able to return nor able to exchange. That noise causes headache too.,2
"Every Products sold by cloudtail retailer are truly authentic, fast and safe delivery.Amazon has become my shopping stop are very responsive.recently I bought this set of zebronics believe me it's awesome clarity and mindblowing bass at this price range. Extraordinary Bluetooth's range response work from other room also.nice display and lighting.It's at par with my expectations.",5
"1. Very Fast Shipping. Received the item in just one day at Bengaluru
2. Packing and Shipping is good everything was intact
3. The Product finish quality is excellent considering the Price of under 2K
4. Quality of Sound also pretty good again keeping in mind the price
5. Bluetooth connectivity was very easy

The only thing I found missing was the remote did not have a battery and had to rush to the local shop to get it. But then this is no big deal.

Overall worth every pai you paid for",5
"Sound Quality is good for this price range. worth buying.
Pros: lowest price better quality for the area of 700 to 800 sq. ft.
Bluetooth mode works well which comes very handy connecting phone.

Cons: Remote is utterly useless. Every time you press any button it gets struck inside. And it does not work most of the time.
But since I connect through Bluetooth or ipod it is only time press so I do not mind using the speaker buttons itself.",4
"Excellent speaker
Pros:
Good sound
Good bass
Build quality is good
LED lights in the speaker is awesome
BT range is good
Cons:
Short cable for speakers
No Aux cable
Remote doesnt come with a battery",5
"Very good product.. The only thing is there is no control on bass!! Except that everything is excellent.. happy with the product.
EDIT:
Purchased this awesome piece 8 months before. Now 2 speakers stopped working. Have to search for service centre.!!!",4
"Update:
Stopped working suddenly without any reason. It has been not even a year.

This has been one of my best purchases on Amazon. I am just in love with this product. Now, don't get me wrong, it might not compete with the likes of Sony in terms of sound quality, but for the money that you pay, you get a very balanced sound output. The bass is not great but decent, not overpowering. The overall sound signature is decent and it is great for normal day-to-day usage. If you are want something which is value for money, this is the one for you. I have been using it for over 5 months and it has never left me unimpressed.

Now, the best part of it - the Bluetooth connectivity. I have used Philips Bluetooth speakers before and it was a pain connecting it as the connectivity always kept losing. With this product, the range is extremely good. I have never faced any lag or connectivity issue even a single time yet. Not only this, even if you are out of the line of sight, it works without any issue until you are within 15m range. I have played songs while being inside my bathroom ;) in my room and the speaker being in the hall of a one bhk flat and it worked flawlessly every single time.

Amazon delivery was also great and the product was delivered in a good condition.

Conclusion - If you want a good wireless speaker with a balanced sound output on a tight budget, go for it. It has all the basics correct, Bluetooth connectivity being an important one.",2

1. no easy provision for placing speakers around the room (length of wires very short)....

2.It actually has only 2 channels ie 2 speakers for left and 2 speakers for right.

Pros.
Other than what I have mentioned above everything is perfect.
1 great sound quality with superb bass.
2 good remote and Bluetooth sensitivity
3 it has 4 10w speakers which gives louder sound than many 5.1 systems.
4 I got it for 2.6 K @ this price I feel wonderful
5 quality of sound is comparable with f&d",5
"One of the best choice of speaker i have made!
Using this product since last 1 year amazing quality sound is great in terms of bass , treble & overall sound quality is excellent. I've purchased this for home use like for tv & computer it have all the features which you need. & In this Price segment it is the best choice! It coat me around 2.2k but you will get it around 2k as of now on lighting deal just wait for it.",5
"Awesome speakers. Bought in 1999 Rs. Totally worth it. Best bass in this range. I tried 5.1 set of same company in 2290, but bass was not up to the mark. So I returned that one. Highly recommended.

Although remote of the speaker was broken. Still it was in working condition.",5
It's the worst experience. Amp is not working at all from day 1. This is just a show piece. Really this is very pathetic quality product. Sending it back is now double work. One star is also waste for this. Finally got it repaired for 500 Rs. Transformer was of low quality which didn't work at all.,1
"Good timing delivery.
Small damage in the main unit, due to poor packing.
* Good sound for a 15*15 room. Bass & treble is tuned fine, don't get a negative thought for missing bass control knob.
* Bluetooth / sd card / USB / aux connectivity works fine. FM connectivity is slightly poor.
* Remote works fine. Equalizer works only for Sd card / USB only. But it is not a problem can adjust the sound in mobile music player when connected to Bluetooth.
* Wire lengths are small , both power & speakers.
## For the price it will satisfy the buyers.
A star less for damage in the main unit, see the attached photo.",4
"Giving it 3 stars, delivery was late by amazon this time

Speakers are good and loud, though the bass is not as much as expected, but still its enough for 1 room,
Bluetooth works fine and connectivity is not more than 20 feet as observed,

The bass woofer creates some distinct kind of noice, which is not in the song played..

The biggest issue i found out is that the speakers doesnt have bass control knob, it has only one knob for volume control, and second issue i saw here is that the EQ mode doesnt work on bluetooth and AUX mode...

But still it is good at the budget of 2k.

I still advice you to go for philips or sony if you can increase your budget to 4k...",3
"The product is truly osam. Tried playing videos with Dolby sound on YouTube and I was amazed to hear what I didn't expect, there is no distortion at all whatever music or sound you play. You can try any music on it, my hall is around 300 sq ft, no disappointment , rather even u can't hear what other says if the volume is full. The blue tooth connectivity is good ..... The look is good.... But I don't expect more from a 2000 rs product..... Buy it you would not be dissapointed....... Enjoy",5
"Pleasant sound from small speakers.
Base is good and you need to adjust the equalizer in your phone if you're connecting via (BT)Bluetooth.
FM working.
Works great in a 10/10 small room or hall.
Pendrive working.
Card reader working.
Not much effect via AUX cable
Overall good product under 3k and works great in a small room or hall.",4
Lenth of the wires is too small. Boss is not upto the mark and there is no individual sound control for each speaker,1
"It is an average product even though I wan't expecting much from it anyways at this price. Out of the box, the biggest annoyance is the extremely short wires for the satellite speakers. And every time you turn it off, the volume that you've set with the remote resets to max. There's no fabric or net covering for the diaphragms, so you'll have to ensure that they're kept clean. There's no equalizer of any sort - the remote is just for volume, changing input source, and On/Standby.
And like other users warned, after just a few weeks of use, the woofer has started hissing and popping even when it is on standby. As long as it gets electricity, it happens, and it rapidly becomes annoying. I can't return mine because I've already cut and spliced longer speaker wires.
On the plus side, it is decently loud for a small apartment and even gives some sort of a surround sound vibe. I haven't used any other input methods other than PC, but others should appreciate the Bluetooth and USB/SD Card inputs",2
"Drawbacks - Remote, 2.1 channel.
Pros - Easy to setup
Good Bass and Treble (Balanced sound quality)
Bluetooth is Good.
Radio is nice but remote sucks.
overall 4 out of 5.
Good one.",4
"I bought it 6 months ago. Overall, its a good system however, there are a few issues. One, like some earlier reviews said, bass is really not good in this. Two, sometimes when I'm trying to control the input (fm/aux/BT) the volume instead, increases and decreases, from the remote. So the remote control is not helpful at these times. Three, every time you switch the system on, after switching off, the volume starts from the highest so it starts blasting music.",3
"Very Nice product..Nice sound quality, Nice look..perfect for home..go for this if you don't need very high bass.
Only con is ..button or facility to change bass and trouble is missing.",4
Cheap quality of the product. I didnt expect that. Subwoofer gave burning smell and right channel speakers weren't working at all.. Really shocked by the QC of this product. Never buying again!,1
"Very Good Speaker !
Very Very HAPPY to buy this Zebronics Bluetooth Speaker at great price in Amazon Deal.
I am very happy to Use the Zebronics Bluetooth Speaker !
I have no idea about the warranty of the product and that is one thing Amazon has to inform the customers at the time of purchase.",5
"This is a very good speaker at this prize range.
But think before you buy... I received a damaged product and replaced it and got this one...",4
"Review after 5 months optimum usage.

Speakers humming continuously. And sometime FM Channels not found.

Nice sound in this price range.

But some issues are facing by me

1. FM channels are not saved.
2. I have connected settop box to Smart TV and aux cable plugged in Smart TV's 3.5 mm jack but when I am watching from Set Top Box sound not coming. Only humming comes. and when I played from USB of Smart TV only two speakers sounds are coming.
3. No instruction manual comes with package. How would I know for correct setup of speakers.
4. Aux Cable and speakers Cable length are very short. If you are unable to given lengthy cable why you are not make a provision for jack system so that customer extend the cable as per requirement. Otherwise we have to cut the Pin and joint the wire and make the whole system as JUGAD. At least cable of two speakers should be 15-20 feet so that we can arrange the system as Left/Right Front and Left/Right Rear.
5. No hanging or wall mounting option is given in speakers.
6. No Power on off button given in Remote. Every time when I start huge humming sound coming.

All above are not a big things or we want some more in this price but I think its quite good some manageable options.

Pl guide / solve the above problems.",3
Very.... Good superb bass volume is also good thanks zebronics and and very cheap price sound also good in full volume,5
"i liked the product. but th reason i didnt give 5 star is it has no bass control. also the maximum sound output is less than i expected. but having this bluetooth device at this rate, its the best. go for it.",4
This product is good.. but the reason I gave only one star is that.the day I received it..the main woofer was non functional. The packing was fine but speakers were damaged from inside. I have asked for a replacement and my request is under process but I suggest buyers to go for Phillips or F&D which are more reliable,1
"Delivery is in time.
Cost of the product is Reasonable
Best Product.
Sound system is Super
Bluetooth connection excellent
FM connection very simple.
Beautiful Style and Modal.
Excellent Excellent.",5
"Those people who are rating this product comparing with Philips, Sony or other renowned brand, they are actually fool!

If you see this one as a Zebronic Product and if you compare it with its features and price then it is just awesome..
It's great bass, loud, 4 speakers, looks,woofer,bluetooth function,aux cable,remote,fm,usb,meromy card adapter, even very interesting led lights are available in just around 2k.. really which was unbelievable for.. but now I'm using it with a great experience!

So if You are finding many functions and good quality product in cheaper rate.. then just blindly go for it..",5
"It is a product worth buying !
Once i opened the package , i was truly happy looking at all the accessories they gave me with it .
Just connect via bluetooth or Aux or Even Pendrives!!!
Everything works just fine..
Audio quality is Awesome....",5
"Initial impression :
The speaker is stylish and has good features. I connected it with my LED tv and it works good as my tv has equalizer function as this speaker has no bass knob.
Overall the sound output and bass is good for its price(I got it for ‚Çπ2000)",4
It was beyond my expectations.for this price I couldn't find any product in the market. Bass is good nd all the aspect.I would personally recommend this product.the only thing I feel bad is that wire length to the speaker are little short .for that I took one star except that everything is perfect,4
"Best price
Good quality.
Best woofer..
Very nice.
Sound effects good
Really very happy..",5
Speaker sounds good worth for the money. But which one i have received blue tooth connectivity problem. So return request submitted. Returned and replacement got. Now Bluetooth is workinv well..!,4
"Cool Product at this range...
Product was good but found little damaged from a corner but nothing to worry.
Delivery was on time but delivery guys generally asking to come out from my working place.
Package was weighted | big and should deliver at doorstep .
Thank you for good deal.",4
"After using a month now i can give my full opinion,
First of all the quality of the sound is good and at that price its worth.The bluetooth feature is amazing but maximum range is 8metres.
There is no bass control but the bass is good at optimal volume as we all use some sort of equalizer so it can be adjusted that way.
Overall if you are planning to buy it i'm sure it will be worth.",4
"Everything okay in this home theater. But I expected many things from this. There's small small disadvantages
1. can't reduce the bass levels there is no bass adjustable
2. Can't hangout in wall there is no wall mount holes in speakers
3. Speakers wires r not lengthy it's just 1.5meter wires.",4
I was very excited with these new speakers it worked really well with my laptop & phone but the real dissapointment was when i connected it to the tv. It gives a continous humming sound likes hissssssss & u just cant ignore it. I started to have a headache because of that. Apart from that its a good product.,3
These are only wired speakers. Can't fina any bluetooth connectivity!,1

"It's a good piece with satisfactory bass and sound. All is good. What's lacking are two things what I feel.... surround sound and mesh in front speakers. It has four satellite speakers but I don't feel the surrounding sound. And without mesh, dust is always ready to seep in. Otherwise a good buy for that price.",4
"I have recieved a good product everything working fine but packing is not good and safe...

*Bluetooth,SD card,usb everything working fine...good product from Amazon...they delivered within two days....I bought it for deal RS.1700...try to pay via Amazon pay they are giving me RS.300 cashback ...",4
I got it in 2000/- so nice in price band... Material used is good... Nice finishing .... Sound quality Little worst.... But in this price range it's OK.... After some times woofer effect goes down .. sound clearance 3.5 star..... If you look for pure sound effects In all way .... Get ready to spend more than 6000 in Philips,5
"One of the best product to own with the smart features and the price Tag is one of the best to buy .
everyone must go for it .
i would give 110 % mark for the Product.
since I was having a Birthday Party this Product has supported me well for myKids Birthday Bash.
Thank You Amazon Thank You Zebronics for the Product",5
"The sound is very good and the bass is good in low budget Bluetooth range is good this is best hometheatre for you ,Thank you zebronics",4
Mind blowing! Very satisfied with this price range we can't get these features in any other sound system. Wonderful purchase! ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜThanks Amazon....,5
Speakers have very good sound equiling system and preety loud voice.Bt range is also very very good.Guys Buy it without any question.,5
"Better product. Rank 4 is given because of good sound quality. Actually I should have given 3 because

1) No Bass and Treble controls for LED / TV / PC inputs.
2) Length of wires is too short
3) Blinking LED ( Multicolour ) lights looks cheap its not required.
4) Woofer should have been front firing for more better results.

Just I noticed a better sound amplification and given rank 4",4
"Great Speakers with Good Bass and Nice sound, This is the best you can get in so low price of 2.5k ,Nothing is better than this trust me . Don't compare with 10k + Price speakers as you are not paying even 1/4 of their price , Deep bass, Nice sound , Go for it",5
"Bestest deal you can get in this price
They are damn clear and loud enough
6of my friends bought the same product after seeing this nice keep it up guys ....",5
"Writing this Review after being use of 30 days.
The quality of the Speakers is very good! But wires is very small, you can‚Äôt even put the speakers in every corner of a small room. and the connector I got had some problem, I purchased it from outside again!
You might get different volume while using with Laptops and Mobile! In Laptop volume will be higher and in Mobile it‚Äôs much low volume.
I would say with this much of money you can‚Äôt get better than this.",3
"Sound output is very loud. Very Good basss. Bluetooth works as expected. But it is of shorter range. You should be in the same room as the speaker. Wires are also very small, you can extend with extra wires. There is no separate controller for changing bass output. Remote controller is good.",5
"Received the product with proper packing and on time delivery from amazon.
The sound clarity and bass quality are excellent.
I compared it with philips speakers and found it's sound quality best due to wooden speakers.
Bluetooth feature is very useful and works well.
Perfect for home use and small parties.
I would give it 5 star due to perfect sound and best price.
A value for money product.
..Thanks amazon",5
Hi guys ..I booked this multimedia speaker system after going through the review.I booked it on the 17 the and received the product on the 21 st..Amazon has delivered it prety fast.The blue tooth and sound quality of this unit is good at this point..The bass could have been better..The only drawback is the FMs signal ...Nevertheless a good product at this price..Cheers to Amazon and Zebronics...,4
"VEry nice product in this price range, sound is clear and enough for indoor use. If you are looking for a system for loud and quality music inside home its perfect for you. bluetooth feature is added advantage. Bass adjustment is missing a bit but its ok for me.",5
"Initially i was a bit choosy about it whether i shud buy this or f&d but my budget was tight hence opted for this... Got it for 1599/- in lightning deal (1999/- offer & 400 amazon cashback) in such a low price its damn awesome... When i played it on max volume it was like hell damn, its small but quite loud... Considering its price point... Infact i bought it without hearing it even so i was a bit worried... But M really happy with it no flaws till now... Dont go for negative reviews if your budget is tight go for it...
Hopefully it will last long... :)
p.s. Dont think u ll get heart thumping bass for such low price thus increase ur budget if u want more bass... For this price its a deal cracker...",5
"Worth for my 2000rs...Bluetooth connected easily...FM super...connected with laptop, my pc, and also my TV...no problem at all",5
"Hello, guys this a good speaker in this category.It has medium bass.Extra bass lovers install viper4windows or other equalizer apps for more enjoyment.",5
Extremely happy with this Speaker as good as expected,5
"Sound is of good quality, Good design and built.
There are however two shortcomings,
1. It lacks a base adjuster. This is I persume a basic requirement.
2. The connector wires are of 3ft length. They should have been more to place it around.

System is worth buying but not if you want a base adjuster",4
"Dear team,
I have recd the order with good condition. Excellent product, to this price.
I could not connect my phone as Usb device.
Also, the equializer option available while connecting Usb only. Not with BT or auxillary.

Other than this i really liked this product",4
"I have been using the speakers for more than one week and I can say that the speakers are awesome, very nice sound. If you want to buy just go for it without giving a second thought.",5
A good buy not great.. Volume levels are bit low but for a small room will suffice...While connected as auxiliary we here a hiss which at lower volumes remains hidden. The blue tooth and usb are perfect so is the remote function. FM can improve. A good choice in the 2000 range,3
"hi! sound is crisp clean but BASS is not good enough want to return it and get it exchanged for something which provides more bass and has an equalizer setting which works on Bluetooth connectivity too.

Just opened yesterday as my daughters room was under renovation , not very happy with the bass , please advise",3
"Good product, good sound clarity, only one draw back, bass & tribble does not have seperate controller, only volume controller is there & all satellite speakers connection wires equal size, little bit shorter, any way over all good experiance",4
Delivered product difective..didn't turn on anyway..lets see what about the replaced product..It will reach me within three days they say...,1
Superb speakers and with bt connectivity @1700 it is a steal!!!. Thank u amazon. Crystal clear sound and bass is reasonably good at this price.Good enough to connect to my led TV.,4
"Initially i was happy with the product, but after one month use, there are some problems. The bluetooth connection keeps on breaking off. The volume also keeps fluctuating on its own. Don't know if they have a support center here or not...",2
"I got this speaker in amazon deal at 2,299 Rs sound is amazing i played this in my Basement hall which is very big in size but the sound delivered by speakers were amazing.
according to me these speakers give best sound when connected via laptop or computer, i connected via mobile and bluetooth the sound comes lil bit slow and bass is also not that much effective.
All four speakers working fine
Woofer working amazing
Bluetooth, USB, FM working good
Remote i din't checked yet.",5
"In this price range ,this is best player üëçgood bass but there is no bass and terible control but there are various equaliser presets mods ..light effect in subwoofer is too good in dark
Fm, pendrive, card , and bluetooth and 3.5 mm support",4
"Awesome sound, what a worth of taking this item in music category...guys go for it...

Nice Bluetooth connectivity range, great bass worth money

As usual got early by Amazon service

Thank you",5
At This Price Range the product is really good and if you want to get the best sound of it use a usb drive with 320 bit song and use it's built in equalizer.But One Thing That Totally Disappointed me That From The 1st Day FM radio is not working the signal quality is worst i have another sudip player i use them at same position with same fm station but the Zebronic not getting any signal like my other one,2
"1 ) Little buzzing sound comes from the the two satellite speakers ,
2 ) base controler is absent
3 ) good look and glossy
4 ) your product will be in waranty (as given in discription ""1 year"") only of your pack is opened by the authorised zebronic employee
if you want a standard speakers for home , they are very good one, if you get it safely received , you are one of the lucky person , at this price , the speakers are too good",4
"product looks different and quality is very cheap. they deceive your mind with pictures but it wont be as when you get the product. sound quality of this one was okay but not excellent, Bluetooth connectivity is good and aux response is bad, you wont get proper sound effect as from Bluetooth. so, for this price range , its okay for few days usage.",2
Nice sound quality.bluetooth working very fast and range is also too good.bass and Trimble combination is fantastic.packing is also too good .it is very nice product produce by amazon.,5
"Speakers are really fantastic in this price range. Bass treble is very nice. But there is no treble and bass button but you will control it through your phone. Glossy finish, clear sound.",5
Just Received It Today ! Superb Quality of Sound and Bass !! delivery is too fast just 5days! At Price 2199. Looks are Just Fabulous!! I'm listening it Right now ! THANKS A LOTS AMAZON ALSO THANKS TO SELLER !!,5
speaker is very good it is good sound and very high quality sound this product is very good to purchase music home theater with Bluetooth,5
"It's a very good product in this price range. The sound quality is great. No distortions at all at high volumes. Bass and treble are balanced, with bias towards bass. I'm a basshead and I'm very happy with it's output. It can easily be used in a large bedroom or hall. Although Bluetooth can be used for playback, I recommend using the AUX cable, as there is no transmission loss.

You might have to use an equalizer, so that you can set the bass/treble according to your liking, if you prefer. It feels premium and well built.The only issue i felt is that the satellite speaker cables could have been longer.",4
"After restart of the system, its sound volume automatically goes to top side. Very irritating. Sound is not upto the mark. It has not surround sound. No any cable to connect with led tv. Remaining is ok.",3
"Guys believe me it has zero bass... U can expect only treble and treble only üò≠.. Clarity is pretty good concerning price tag but again it has no bass at all.. So at the end its just useless. Wires of 4 speakers are in equal size and too shot. Look is stylish and shiny. Fm doesn't work properly, i tried hard... Subwoofer cracks bass. I bought it for 1999 and now returning.. Wondering how it can win awards üòè. Thank you!",1
It is what i was looking for for this price. I ordered two different well known brands but i returned and now i m happy.. i wud thnk amazon for cooperating. And yes this is a feature rich pelroduct which gives more than expectation.. :),5
"Awesome product... i got it for 1,999. It supports bluetooth, aux cable. .. in built fm.... it has multi color led light in the woofer which changes automatically. ...good sound...bass plays according to the song...u can't adjust the bass..but thats not an issue..",5
"I got this product in just 3 days.
Sound quality of this system is awesome.
Look wise it's wonderful product.
One thing I miss was trebles and bass control button.

All over it's worth to buy.",4
"Excelent product..
DON'T trust negitive reviews .
Superb sound,
Nice clarity speakers.,
Sub woofer has LED Light..
It looks very premium..

Only con is..
Speakers wire lenth is small..",5
"Sound quality and Design of the speakers are very good. I think i get the diffective product. After 1 hour of continues usage, I hear distrubing noise from 2 speakers. Oredered for replacement since there is no option for returning of this product. I hope i will get better one. I will post once again after i get the replacement.
I got the replacement within 1 day. As expected the speakers are very good in this price range.",4
Sound is ok bass is vary low if you're bass lover please don't bay this product waste of money ‚ùå,1
"I won't say its best in its class, but it has decent sound. Bass does not have enough punchy sound, but its not bad too be ignored. Build quality is very poor, need to handle with care.",4
Sound quality is good. But there is no way to adjust bass/treble which is a biggest drawback,4
"there is no bass in this music system, i want to return this but amazon stupid policy of replacement sucks. I wanted to buy a better system with good bass, i am ready to pay extra too but i have no idea how to contact seller. Bad experience buying electronics item from amazon, wont ever buy electronics again from amazon",1
Awsome Speaker good quality.......,4
"1)Sound : soft, not so high, its average or normal
2)Bass and terrible : Not available
3) Bluetooth, Aux, usb , sd card slot, fm : good
Remarks : i cut 1 star for ""Sound not high"" & 1 star for ""bass not available"".
Recommend :(a) for low budget : this is best
(b) for high budget : purchase only branded product",3
Guys it is really awesome and the sound quality is very nice,5
"I like it. Good for a room. Bass is okay but no bass control option. Manual buttons have delay action as well as remote.
Overall product is okay for this price range.better then intex.",4
good but FM is not working and there is no proper protection layer/cover on the top of speakers,3
"Good product as per the price range. Some issues are: a. Next/prev button not working, acting as soft volume up/down. b. Equaliser only have 5 presets which is not working in FM Mode.c.speaker connecting wire is little less in length",3
"I bought this a month back and now some kind of sound is coming from the music system..I bought it in advance to fit it in the shop...But now when the fittings are done,sound is coming from the music system which is really bad and disappointing,After the fittings only,it started came,There is no option to contact with the seller so I am posting this review..
Thankyou",1
"I got this speakers @ 2200 /- Fully satisfied with prime 1 day delivery.
Who are looking for speakers under 3000 range this is the best deal out there for you. Go with it without having a second thought.
Quality is good, Sound is clear with good bass. I'm heart fully satisfied with this 4.1 channel home theatre.",4
ordered it for a friend and she seems satisfied with it for now. everything attached is in working condition for now. issues with bluetooth connectivity though,4
"Value for money.. excellent delivery
Sound quality is better... It might have more bass effect.. but still good..
Suggestion : Go for it",5

"I have replaced the product as the first product was defected. But now after replacing the product, it is working fine and I am in love with it. Purchased in price 2341 with additional 300 cash back over Amazon pay balance made the product more value for money. If some one want to purchase, don't get much confusion, just go for it.",4
"This is the best home theater for this prize, good bass, good volume everything is balance no need of adjusting bass and trable it automatically balance sound quality...very good product.",5
After using ten month its become useless not even turn on really its just wasting of money really now I feel bad about my previous review,1
The speakers are good...the bass is good only if we raise the volume...the main plus point is Bluetooth enabled...the plug is little short..best speakers under 3000,4
"Very good speaker at Rs.2300/- with Bluetooth connectivity. But don't expect too much bass.
No bass control and treble control. Little bit 'hrrrrr' noise at full volume. Satellite speakers wire length is only 3 feet, so you need extension wire if you are placing the speakers at a particular distance.
I have connected this speaker with my led TV. I was watching a ODI cricket, initially the sound was very good, but at the end of the match (after 8 hours) the sound became very low (volume became less than the TV speakers). So you can use this speaker 5 to 6 hours continuously.",4
"Don't be fooled these are computer speakers...and no return is allowed, feeling cheated",1
Third class product didn't working after one year of use remote is also not working properly.,1
"At given price of 2000 in deal, it is a very good deal. Base isn't that great as some people claim here. Its just ok. Few 2.1 systems have better sound output.",4
It should get zero üåü but there is no option. The sound is even less than my TV and the name of woofer and bass is a cheating really. Really heart breaking for music lovers. Initiated the return process. Time to see Amazon services.,1
"Pros:
Nice product for home use.
Good sound quality.
Can be used for small home party.

Cons:
Very small connecting wire.
No Battery with remote.
Bluetooth range to very impressive.",4
Excellent product at this price range. The only issues are less bass and bass control is not present. Speaker cables are small also. The Bluetooth connectivity is great.for small rooms it is an excellent product.,4
"Everything is good but wires are small. My Buying price 2300rs, i m not happy to buy this.",2
"i got this speaker for rs 2150 on 5 of nov ....when i got i play a song its sound is good but after two days i am facing a sound problem ...i think for return but i go to servicr centre they exchange the speaker with new one. ....
thanz for zerbonics service centre",4
its doesnt have buttons or dial so uh cant adjust it manually theater automatically set bass nd treble if not a bass lover uh can go for this but if uh want bass nd set it manually you can go for zebronics samba or zebronics mambo if uh want expensive than this otherwise this product have good sound and bass,3
Nice product in this price if you want to buy a good speaker in lower price than it is a good choice. Sound quality is also very good.,5
"At this price, 2.3k worth features. Bluetooth feature is a bonus.",5
Very good home theater system.bass is superb and sound quality also very good.i love this,5
"Best Budget Home theater in this price range.
Built quality is also good.
Small size and compact.
It's looks is also attractive.
Sound is just awesome loudness and bass is Good Enough.
Also Zebronics service is also pretty fast and responsive.",5
Best speakers for the price no doubt! Good Bass and treble! Must buy for anyone with budget under 3000 Rs.,5
"Excellent speakers for connecting to devices where equaliser is accessible. Brilliant base at this price range. But for the AUX connectivity to the devices which don't have option to customise sound, not that good. (Like connecting to a TV doesn't give a good sound)",4
"This product is very gud. It's sound is superb. It works very well. But something is wrong. It has not bass controller. It has not heavy sound.

"Quality product from Zebronics. Never expect a boom sound, but it is ok for a normal hall. It works well with my Sony bravia LED Tv.",4
"Product is excellent and as advertised. Value for money speakers if you aren't looking for them to last decades.
One flaw is that all the 4 speaker have the same cable length(which is pretty short) so in order to actually place the rear speakers at a bit of a distance, you will need and extending cable, which may sometime cause some signal loss.
And part of the casing on the woofer vibrates sometimes on low frequency bass.
But otherwise, no other complaints so far.",4
THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT.. YOU CAN TRY FOR IT......,5
"Well got this today on 04-01-2018. As many person has written that the bass n vooume has some issue. Yes it has bt only with fm. Since the person buying this definitely not going toh play fm songs. Didn't tried it with tv. Bt with BLUETOOTH AUX AND SD/USB eorking perfect.
N the bass n volume also depends upon the deice or quality of songs.",5

"Yesterday I recieved the Zebronics 2.1 Bluetooth Speaker, Today I,m Writing the review
Pros-
1. Nice Looks and Design is Pretty Good and attractive for its 3colour LED inside the subwoofer
2. Sound Quality is As good as the price tag say, in a normal room it,s sound quality is pretty decent.
3. Bluetooth facility is totally hassle free, Just Press Input Button and the bluetooth mode turns on.
4. Extremely affordable, You Can,t get an 2.1 branded speaker at 1.7K (Great Indian Sale) with AUX IN, BLUETOOTH, SD-USB and Digital Display
5. Multi Purpose Remote is provided.
Cons-
I have Found a single issue, that is VERY SHORT POWER CABLE AND SATELLITE SPEAKER CABLE that doesn't allows you to spread the speakers all over the room.(It decreases One Star)

Overall Verdict-
If you in the market for a 2.1 speaker with various connectivity input options then this Zeb. Product is very much recommended for you.
Zeb has also promised for 1 yr overall warranty.

Amazon verdict- Packaging very good
delivery in 3 day( They Refunded the Extra payment for guaranteed 2 day delivery as it comes late)
Very Good Customer Support",4

"Using since last four months and fully satisfied with it. I have also used Intex IT-301 N FMU but I have found Zebronics more justifying when compared with sound quality, features and price. However, I have observed a very irritating humming sound from woofer when used for long hours.",4
