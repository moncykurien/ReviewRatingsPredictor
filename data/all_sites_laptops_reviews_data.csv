okkk gooodd.It is good wrking well................................,5
Perfect. It doesn't get any better.I am using Dell inspiron 5520 with RAM 2GB which was definitely insuficient so i ordered Transcend SO 4GB DDR3 RAM from snapdeal . The delivery time was very less and my product is very much satisfying . After installing 4 GB RAM in my Laptop it is working smoothly.,5

perfect.perfect,5
"A good choice for DDR3 RAM for notebooks..Upgraded my 2GB laptop to 6GB using this.

Works perfectly, didn't encounter a single issue. Just popped it in and booted up and the new RAM was detected without a hitch. 

No more lag. Can do heavy multitasking now.",5
"Got 1600 MHz instead of 1333 MHz.Great product, the product description says 1333 MHz RAM but I got 1600 MHz one. Nevertheless, my laptop (Dell XPS L502X) toned the RAM down to 1333 to sync it with the older 4GB. Now I am having good 8GB and performance has indeed improved (Not much as I already had 6GB RAM)",5
Value for money RAM.Been using many of these RAMs for sometime now and works perfectly and reasonably priced.,5
Perfect. It doesn't get any better.Great product. No compatibility issues with my SVE15129CNB.,5
Worth the money.Works as expected. Looks rugged.,4
"Hynix Laptop Ram.I have started using this ram in my laptop a week ago and it is working efficiently....
 Initially ,it took some time to get synchronised with my another preloaded Elpida Ram of 1066 MHz . Now ,I am able to use heavy applications smoothly.....Thanks to the snapdeal for providing this product cheaper than the other sites like flipkart,amazon etc...",5
"Not for performance purpose..Though it has 1333Mhz freq overall but core frequencies are low and that's why it doesn't performs like a real 1333Mhz  RAM,not good for gaming or performance enhancement of PC.But can be used if you want to increase speed in general tasks or want smooth multitasking.Afterall its Hynix and u can trust it.",3
Perfect RAMstick.easy to configure in inspiron n5010. and good speed,5
"Perfect & Good One Product for my Lenovo G580.There is no notable speed improvement after installing RAM, It's an OK product.",5
Crucial is crucial for upgrading.Perfect ramstick in affordable price. Dont think too much just buy it.,5
"Crucial is an excellent memory manufacturer.A good product. 
Delivery was on time
The ram is absolutely amazing.

Thanks to Snapdeal and the seller for their excellent service !",5
Awesome product for my Lenovo G580.Go Crucial... System is real fast now....,5
"Awesome product.Crucial is one of the top brands in terms of RAM and SSD (basically all NAND flash) right there with Samsung.
Note the voltage is 1.35 V. But all 1.35V RAM are dual voltage. It will work with those old laptops that have 1.5V RAM installed as well!
When it comes to RAM, trust Hynix, Samsung, Crucial to the max. Transcend and kingston should be No 2. And ADATA, Dolgix etc should be avoided.

I bought it for my QNAP 251 network storage.",5
"Good product....A good product. 
Delivery was on time
The ram is absolutely amazing.

Thanks to Snapdeal and the seller for their excellent service !",5
"Not compatible with Vaio VPCEB44EN! But Snapedal Refunded my money Promptly, Without any Issues!.I have ordered this product for my ASUS S550CM-CJ054H ... And it's working clike champ..

"Excellent low-voltage RAM.Delivered on 2nd day. Installation is super easy so who all are seeking for urgent upgrade of their laptops, go ahead and buy. Worked with 3 year old Samsung laptop even if the voltage was higher than specified for this RAM",5
"Good product.I have a Dell Vostro 2520 with a Hynix 2GB DDR3 Ram which worked at 1.5V. So was confused in buying this DDR3L ram working at 1.35V.
Rest Assured, The ram is working great alone and with the 2gb Ram to give a total of 6GB.

Though CPU-Z shows it working at 1.35V along with 1.5V 2GB but I havent encountered any Problems till Now........Had successfully passed memtest and other benchmarks :)

Pros:
- Easy to Fit
- Genuine
- Is of Crucial :p

Cons
- None i guess",5
Perfect. It doesn't get any better.I got this as an upgrade to my dad's 5 year old Lenovo Z560. Note that the voltage rating is 1.35V only! Recommended to buy in pairs to run on dual channel mode.,5

Dell Vostro Battery.Battery is fine but warranty is only 6 months that is too less. If you will go with other brand they will give you around 1-2 yrs warranty but if you are believing only in Dell's brand than it's good deal for you.,3

"Late delivery.The delivery was late. While other sites are providing delivery in just 2 or 3 days, I got the expected time for delivery 8 days and that was also extended. Got the product after 15 days of order. Also my laptop is Vostro 1014 but the provided battery was fitted with difficulty in the slot. Obviously it was for some other model. Also facing some issue with battery, sometimes it stopped charging and this is an intermittent issue during charging.",3

Everything is satisfied but the packing was worst.Packing quality and the type of packing should really depend on the delivery address.if you are delivering from Nehru place to gtb nagar the packing was OK.But if you going to delivered the product 2500km away then the packing was very careless. give more emphasis on packing because if the product got damage while in transit then the whole process is of no use.,5

I have recommended to my friends to go ahead with lapcare laptop battery instead of original. Thank you snapdeal...",4
Nice.Good stuff,4
"An affordable beast !
Pros:
1. Incredible performance, will average minimum of 60FPS on any game (except cyberpunk) at maximum settings at 1080P, even in games with ray tracing.
2. Display is very good, high refresh rate makes everything better
3. Fans are good at keeping temps down
4. Trackpad and keyboard are good
Cons:
1. When the display shows something totally black, like in a loading screen, you can see the backlight bleed and prominently observe glowing patches on the screen.
2. Fans, while effective, are really really loud. Headphones are a must while gaming...
3. Especially because the speakers are sub par, they're not loud, and neither do they sound good
4. Even though fans are effective at keeping cpu and GPU temps down, the laptop surface heats up quite a bit and you can feel it.
5. While 3200 Mhz DDR4 RAM is nice to have, it is running in single channel, can easily gain quite a lot more frames with upgrading ram.
6. i7 10870-H is still a good cpu and performs well in gaming, can't escape the fact that it's a generation older and is 14nm. Ryzen options are more powerful certainly however this chip is ample for gaming.
7. Even though the display is excellent, doesn't support HDR. Would have loved HDR on this display.
8. RGB keyboard is cool but will automatically switch off backlight with 30 seconds of inactivity. Haven't yet found any way to switch off this timer. Very annoying.
9. The amount of bloatware included in this laptop is truly special.
10.. Have had lots of experience with Acer and so have many people I know. Acer's track record with reliability and build quality is shocking and I swore to myself never to buy another Acer

And yet, for this price, the specs are fantastic and the sheer performance is enough to forget all the issues with the laptop. You're buying this for the RTX 3060, make no mistake about that.",5
Best laptop in this price segment.. battery is quite bad but the performance is beast... You can play AAA games easily and feel best experience..I'm using this laptop since 2 weeks and I'm happy with it. I'm content creator and 3d animator and I can work easily. Go for it guys this is beast machine. Thank you acer for this product and flipkart for the best deal. Render process is super and Best part is Ray tracing you can feel the game.,5
"To be honest
Pro's 1) RGB keyboard
2)144Hzs with 3ms
3)Rtx 3060 with 6gb
4)8 cores 16 Threads
Con's
1)it is not value for money like ""if predator comes with ryzen 7 5000 series it definitely a Beast now it is 8 cores 16 Threads in Intel not even beats the ryzen 7 4000series"".
2)near top of keyboard there is a huge heating issue.definately need to buy cooling pad
3)base frequency is 2.25Ghz which is the most important and disadvantage in this laptop
So guys please think twice before buying this laptop",4
"The Laptop is a masterpiece with stunnig design and premium looks.
The packing is awesome with a case to store it. The keyboard is customizable to different RGB colors via the Predator sense application.

The fan is quite loud when turbo mode is turned on.
The screen brightness levels are extreme. You can easily have a great experience even while using it outdoors.",4
"Good laptop but customer care folks are real disappointment, as no information was given regarding Accidental Damage Protection which comes complementary with warranty extension if purchased within 7 day of invoice date and if missed cannot be covered. On the 7th day, I reached out to them but they didn't want to help, they said base warranty registration has not been done (for which no intimation was received neither any software directed for the same post first boot) and now it will take 48 hours and till that time 7th day condition would be missed for ADP to be applied in the offer and they shut the call. Later I anyway went and purchased ADP+2yrs warranty extension on Acer website and asked them to tag it to my laptop serial number. Clear they could have helped but refrained from doing the same. Timely delivery by Flipkart.",5
"So i wanted a decent Gaming Laptop with Good specs. Then i found this beast having allround top specs :

Pros:
1. Built and Design : It is a well built laptop No complaints. Design is great too
2. Display : The 144hz display is Amazing Colours are so good.
3. Fans : The Fans are amazing . They keep the laptop cool whenever the temp rises.(One of the point which made me buy this laptop)
4. Performance : Only one word INCREDIBLE will give easily 60+FPS at ultra in most of the games.
5 HDD and SSD : The HDD is fast since its 7200RPm and 256 GB SSD boots the laptop very fast. I would have loved it even more if they gave us 512GB SSD instead of 256 GB
SSD

I know this cant be a pros for everyone but for me it is

1. The Booting animation and the sound . I Just loved it. It gives a feel that we own a Gaming device .

Cons:
1. The speakers sound output is very low. My previous lenovo laptop had JBL speakers so i know what i am missing.
2. Though fans are effective but they are loud and we need a headphone to listen to the sound
3. The CPU is a generation older and its 14nm. Thought it works really well and is enough for gaming.

These are the cons which we can improve with Upgrades:

1. Ram is single channel so if we add one more stick then we can get better frames easily.

Games i have tested : (Remember we can get better framerates if we add one more stick) and i have updated rtx 3060 TGP to 105 w from an update

1. Overwatch : 125-130 in ultra
2. Shadow of Tom Raider : 62 avg in ultra settings RTX on DLSS On
3. Red dead Redemption : 59 avg in ultra settings (this game will soon get DLSS and after that we can have FPS boost)


Overall i will say that seeing the current situation in the PC and Laptop industry i can say this is a BEAST at this price point. Its a must buy for all gamers out there",5
"Best laptop with great discount and offers . Flawless processor , awesome display and stylish body , which looks premium. Graphic card RTX 3060 is great for seamless gaming and graphic experience.I was searching a decent gaming laptop and choose this over MSI due to being loyal to Acer and better service network than MSI . I upgraded my I3 3rd gen to this laptop . RGB keyboard is cool but fans are bit loud and noisy however effective to keep cool .
Not a bad deal , indeed .",5
"This laptop is a beast, and a steal for your money. The combo of rtx 3060 with i710870H is just too powerful. Can run any game at high settings.
Benchmarks:
- valorant: I was getting 130+ fps in high settings easily
-warzone: I was getting 80-100 fps easily in high settings
-gta online: I was getting 100-110 fps in high and very settings

In all the games played for 4.5 hours straight, the cpu temp. never went above 75 degree C and the gpu temp. never crossed the 67 mark.
Clearly it can be seen that though it has very powerful gpu cpu, it has good geat management.

Build quality is very good, with some flex on the lid, but its due to the fact that its made of aluminum. You also get thunderbolt here, which is awsome. The 4 zone rgb gives a really nice touch to it. Booting time is around 14 sec with games apps and drivers installed",5
"This is my first review ever. Value for money product. Good display except for the light screenbleeding issue but the colour accuracy makes up for it .
Rendering in Adobe premier pro is quick without much of a framedrops, 90fps average while playing Forza Horizon 4 in ultra settings. So Gpu is great, thanks to RTX 3060.
I7 10870h gives a decent Cpu performance. There is no overheating as such. Overall a decent package for content creators and game lovers.",5
"Overall very good price to performance ratio.
With upgrades like RAM and a SSD, the laptop would be even better - has extra empty slots for the same.
Doesn't heat up much while gaming. Sound is average.
Pro Tip : Uninstall Nvidia Drivers and reinstall them through System Updates, significantly increases fps in games.
Definitely Recommended for anyone looking for a value for money laptop.",5
"pros:
1. cooler boost keeps laptop reasonably cool.
2. display is nice
3. boot time and loading time is also great thanks to ssd

cons:
1. 8gb ram is not enough
2. out of 512gb you get around 380gb ssd although fast is not enough.
3. performance according to price is great but gtx 1650 in other laptops is better than 1650ti maxq
4. speaker is clear but has no base and is poorly positioned

If you want to buy this laptop be ready to shed more money on storage and ram",4
"Good graphics performance but still You'll not feel it's 9th Gen I5 processer.
You'll feel lags in each task like opening windows explorer or editing videos.
Video rendering speed is very good but while editing it hangs so many times.
I have another Asus i5 processer without graphics but that's working like MAKHAN
Keyboard is also little different so it takes time to get used to it.
And yes you'll see it's heating more than normal when you're rendering videos or playing games",3
"Honestly this is my first laptop
I think its good but not sure though
But with decent specs its the best in this price range with max q and ti
And it also comes with the 2 year warrenty
I think its decent for its price range and the best one to get i cant give you the full review yet but as far as i have used its fun
Thanks for the product",4
"Firstly I would like to start with battery performance, As many reviews on this laptop has given low battery performance.
1) Battery:
I felt same initial 1 week that battery is less but there are settings in MSI center (It's an app in laptop) to change gaming mode which is not required all the time. I took this laptop for programming because my softwares are heavy and this laptop is supporting it easily.
You won't believe first week I was getting only 2 to 2.5 hours back up but once I got to know about extra settings in MSI center, battery life went to 4 to 4.5 hours.
I watched movies continuously, did programming extensively, browsing, normal games etc. Battery back up is awesome.

2) Performance:
Excellent, Faster, Fabulous laptop with this high configuration. It's perfect.

3) Display:
Display is good and perfect.

4) Speakers:
Good speakers with enough amount of coverage.

5) Design and look:
Unique, stylish, marvelous design

6) Worth every penny of our money, excellent purchase and it's my first ever personal laptop. Please go through each and every setting before making any wrong decisions.

I would recommend this laptop above lenovo, dell etc",5
"I am writing this review after 2 weeks.
Just go for blindly if you got it for around 60k ,

The i5 with GTX graphics card games gonna run smoothly
You can All games can play in 60fps according to your customisation
And modern games like valhalla ,days gone , resident above 50fps .
Webcam quality is ok.
Display quality is superb. And have less bezels.
If you experience any lag connect the charger and keep the battery in Windows at best performance mode and select extreme performance mode in dragon center for best experience and cooling .

I am a hard core gamer , i will play minimum 3hrs and the maximum temperature i noticed is around 60 because it's summer and i don't have an a.c also .. so it can manage well.

Use nahimic software which is inbuilt in laptop to adjust sounds according to your activities

CONS--if you want to upgrade ram or storage you need to remove factory seal which costs you warranty lose.
SPEAKER QUALITY IS GOOD but the place ment in bottom so you need to arrange properly for best experience .

AND THAT'S ALL NO COMPLAINTS
AND this is my first laptop purchase so I've done so much research on this product..",5
Everything is fine performance is good build quality is nice but major minus is track pad its not at all working even though i try shorcut keys its not working you have to order extrnal mouse.. Touchpad is not working (Even i press FN+F3),4
"performance is super, 🔋 back up and display also good, design is ok, got the product in big billion day at reasonable price, first time tried MSI by ignoring HP as I listened recently from many, they said performance wise MSI is the best. Now experiencing it, everything is good till today. writing this review after 1 month, has to see how long it will work better. thank you",4
"Don't think twice just go for it...
Battery is OK don't expect good battery backup in gaming laptops.
Ssd Is fast and if you want to change from those core companies like dell and asus go for msi you will not regret it..
If you want second options go for asus tuf or Lenovo legion y540 but if you are getting this laptop under 57000 then go for it",5
"Everything is perfect 😊
Just only issue is that it has only single fan yes it has heat pipe connected to both cpu and gpu but still single fan is not enough to cool this powerful beast
Maybe a cooling pad will help",4
Great product. Loved it. You get the same laptop in two variants. One with graphics 1650ti with maxq and the other with just maxq. Go for the one with ti coz it's new and advanced. This laptop does not have ms word( most gaming laptops do not have ms word) so it's better to think through.,4
Giving review after using 3 days ....looks wise its jst woww😍..... And charging is fast and long battery life .... Over all its a good purchase... Go for it👍,5
"Writing my review after 2 days. Just superb laptop with this price range for office work. 237 gb SSD free space. One storage location so made a partition. Very fast bootloader. Nice display.
Very light weight. Only problem is mcafee antivirus can't allow you to load anything in pc. 30 days trial. Better uninstall after 30 days use",5
"Every thing is good , good performance, but look is not so good, its weight is very light, battery back up upto 5 hours in continnious operation,rather 6 hours normal,.No fingerprints lock is there with the model,another things, for school,or study purpose it is good in this budget.",4
"I am a technical support executive for laptop...
I bought this laptop for doing my job... After using 7 day 👉here is my review 👇

Built quality supup 👌

Display is sufficient
Company claims that this product has 12 hours battery backup (ideal) I know no one can get that much backup but at least it should given 8 hours backup I used continuesly for office purpose and I got 5 hours backup only

Performance issue also I faced

But remember I am a heavy user that's why.... Overall very good product with very good service by HP",4
"Excellent product in this price range + is very good for study's and office works ... Can also use for entertainment and games + sound quality is superb
Loved it",5
Nice laptop works fast good sound go for it,5
"The Laptop is best for its price range..The processor is good for normal purposes and even for some games. Those who would like to know about the graphics card model, The graphics card is : Intel UHD Graphics 32EU ( Jasper Lake ) which is better than UHD 620 but still, not best for high end gaming. But for other purposes like, Photoshop, Video Editing, Movies, MS Office, It is simply the best!
Battery backup is OK, Charging is quite fast :)
User Interface is smooth
Keyboard feels a little cheap..but ok for me :)
It's lightweight and easy to carry and quite small too
There's no any heating problems unless u run some games
I've played FIFA 14, Assassin's Creed and they both runs soo well..I'll update my review after I run GTA 4",5
Super quality,5
It keypad ise so bad,3
A perfect light weight and decent looking laptop for students... Worth the cost and does even give extra RAM slot (DDR4) and a SSD slot too (NVMe M.2 compatible),4
"I brought it for my normal use like lectures,movies,and other minor work it gives me better performance.
Athlon dual core is now better then ryzen and you can worth buy at this reasonable price....
But I missed other essential items like laptop bag and
It's screen protector...",5
Nice one from hp but a little slow,5
Good,4
Super display,4
"It's worth the money
Good battery
Good display
Good specifications
Very much useful for the students
And best budget laptop in this price and features",5
"Good product for students and multitasking
Display is good
Keyboard is nice
Battery is osm give 7hr back
But the packaging by flipkart is very bad packaging was teared 😢😠😠😠",5
Good for home use,5
Best laptop under 30000,5
Design was nice...nice performance so far... value for money,4
"Best laptop within 40k. Build quality is very good and looks slim, light weighted. Good for doing office works ( Business and Student use).",5
Nice product for students and casual users. Capable laptop . It power on within 6-7 seconds .Overall i am happy about my decision to buy hp,5
Nice laptop finaly nice delivery looking so good best performance laptop i like the laptop.,4
Good pc for office work & students & I using laptop very smooth to open & this processing to open is good.i Satisfied this laptop,4
Good Product. Worthy. I recommended to buy. Speed is very good.😍🥰🤩,5
"Awsome product.....
Good",5
Best mid range laptop with latest i3 11th generation and 65W fast charger included,5
"Value for money. If you all planning to buy a laptop under 40k don't wait. Buy this ...
Battery a1
Look a1
Boot time 10sec",5
"Only downside is that it comes wit two 4GB RAMs instead of one 8GB RAM.
256 GB SSD would be sufficient for Home use if not planning to store too many media files.",4
Good machine,5
"Product is good but the fan is running continuously, its little annoying if you live in a quiet peaceful area.
Second thing I have mention is the build quality of the product. Its made of plastic, not the best one but little low in quality.
Otherwise it is a good product, good display, good performance, good battery life, soun of the speakers are also loud. I'm satisfied with this product.",4
"It's just amazing! Let me get the details here:

• At this price it will be the best buy for office/casual use, average gaming (Haven't played any high res games yet).
• It has 1 SSD 256GB and 1 HDD of 1TB. Windows is installed in SSD so the loading time (from turned off to start) is near about 5-7 seconds.
• Usable Ram is around 5.86GB. 8GB is installed in one slot so another one is free to get another ram installed.
• It is very light. It doesn't have a CD drive. Honestly, I don't think anyone use any CD these days. If you use disk then you need to get a usb disk drive.
• Everything is pre-installed. Windows (of course), all the drivers update, Office 19' so you can use it right away!
• It doesn't have a keyboard backlight.

In short, as I said, at this price this is the best. Trust me, I investigated on Croma, HP world etc. to see if I get any better model (HP) at this price but I failed.",5
"Very good It's a beast at the price of 40k
Loved it and also the cheapest ssd laptop offered by hp you won't find it anywhere else. Thank you Flipkart for quick delivery",5
"It's amazing! Best is this category. I just bought this item for the prime purpose to support my daughter for her online classes of class XI. After using it for 4 days my observations are as under :
1. Speedy Delivery : So thankful to Flipkart for its speedy delivery. I booked it on 21st of May by evening, got delivered on 23rd Morning. Really impressed!!!
2. Product Style, look and feel : Superb! Light weight, handy, quite presentable !!!
3. Speed and performance : With 256GB SSD, its boot with in 7 seconds with the rocket like speed. Ryzen 3 speed much better the i3.
4. Camara, Microphone and Sound quality is up to satisfactory level.
5. Battery backup time is also good, till date I used it upto 6 hours easily, good enough for me.
6. Preinstalled windows 10 home and Office just ready to use.
So, friends I am fully satisfied with this product....... really true value of money. If you are not going to use very high end graphics application softwares.......just go for it ........
Missing some optional features like backlight keyboard, fingerprint scanner ect...",5
"Thanks Flipkart for fast delivery in our lockdown zone.

Now I am writing review after 10 day use of laptop.

1. Better performance cause of 8gb ram and 256gb SSD, it boots up only in 7 secs. and I didn't faced any lag till now.

2. Better Battery Performance (upto 6-7 hrs ) with fast charging.

3. Screen Quality is good but it has little bit backlight bleeding issue cause of IPS Display (this is only noticeable on Black Screen).

4. Fan speeds and noise only increases when Work load increased on Processor (For example, Windows Defender Scanning) but No any Fan noise will be noticeable while normal work.

5. My minimum RAM usage is Recorded around 40% and maximum 95% (when using Android Studio with Emulator)

6. Ryzen 3 3250au Processor works between 1%~5% on normal work. and While using Android Studio with Emulator It reaches 100%.

7. Camera Quality is good.


The final words for this laptop is that -

1. Best laptop for Home and Student usage
2. We can do Graphics Designing, Web Development and Android Development on this laptop
3. But it is not for specially GAMING.",4
"Over all good laptop for this money. Best option to choose this laptop is design, display and 256SSD and 1TB HDD.I like this laptop ❤",5
"Overall the laptop is outstanding
My needs are some online classes and a bit gta5 in free time and this thing can handle it nicely but at lower graphics which does not make game too much laggy but it's fine.....the design is fabulous and it supports quick charging only takes 20 minutes to charge from 15% to 100%.....best processor in this range with a 256gb ssd only this laptop offers such a configurations......Hats off to HP.....wonderful product for a bit of gaming and online classes.",5
For work purposes it works smoothly even I played a small game and there is huge lag for work purpose and Student use its best buy,4
"Just amazing !!!
Nice experience with powerful processor... Very good battery backup (about 6 hrs).. in good price..
Just go for it !!!",5
"It has a great slim look, the audio and display quality is also very good. It works really first. Great choice undoubtedly. But the battery backup is not so good.",5
Just outstanding,5
Good,3
Good Product,5
Waw.. awesome,5
It lags more than 1 minute and it stucks,4
Good,4
"This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster than earlier. Believe me guys there is no ssd issue whoever is getting slow system or charging issue they should update the windows and the BIOS. The battery backup is also good about 4-5 hrs in normal use.The display and the looks are the best thing about this laptop.It looks super premium.
If you want to buy a laptop for gaming or normal daily use it is the best one. Go for this guys you wont regret it.",5
Good product as used of now.... Everything is good and also SSD slot is given for upgradation.... Only keys of Keyboard are not looking as reliable as other basic HP laptops....it has been a month now... I will use it for three months again and will update my review.....,5
AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much,5
"For that price... it's exceptionally good. Played Far Cry 4 at Ultra Graphics 1080p.. was super smooth. So was GTA V, Just Cause 4. So you can do pretty decent gaming. General PC performance is good. Photoshop 2020 (June) works perfectly and also other Adobe products. Display is super cool too. So yeah, a good system overall for that price.",4
"RAM upgrade is must do because the useable RAM is only 6GB, Ryzen 5 3550H is a great processor however eats up 2GB RAM in system, Due to that Heavy games like GTA 5 stutter, The FPS while gaming is good however stuttering happens when games doesn’t get enough RAM, Due to which I have to spend another 3.5K to put a 2nd 8GB ram stick. Rest all Is good Display is crisp Battey is good for gaming laptop anyway to play games chargers needs to be plugged in, Although the 5400 RPM HDD is quite slow my previous PC had 7200 RPM HDD the difference is noticeable. Before you buy Do check out Acer aspire 7 that one a Gtx 1650ti a better Graphics card however I didn’t buy ACER cause didn’t trust the reliability of the brand and seen some videos that people got defective ACeR laptops",4
"It's good gameing laptop in this price
Display is good battery backup is good
And I like keyboard 😁👌",5
"Best laptop in this price range... Believe me if you are willing to buy this laptop don't hesitate just go Nd buy it !! Booting takes 22 sec... If you want more faster then I will recommend you to go for ssd variant... Speed of HDD is not that slow people are reviewing above🙄... Nd wait wait wait people are also saying above ram is the problem only given 6 GB so every device have some pre installed software so non of the brand will provide u 8 out of 8 gbs 🤦♂️...there is no problem with the storage also🤦‍♂️♂️ just go for it.. if u are buying this for gaming then yes battery will be the major problem but if u buyed this laptop for multiple tasking like I buyed then battery will not a problem...
Hope I helped u all Nd able to clear all your doubts I deducted 1 star from five just for late delivery otherwise this laptop deserve 5 star...",4
"The AMD APU is a disappointment.
If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for. Other than that Gtx1650 is a beast and ryzen 5 will do just good enough to get you through 60fps on high settings on most games.
Upgrading your ram and adding a ssd will last you this system for another 4-5+ years.
4/5 just because of the ram issue, other than that it's good.",4
"Its an absolute beast if u know what are the necessary steps to follow after completing the installation of your laptop...

Make sure you update all the drivers and specifically windows bios and nvidia drivers, because it enhances the performance very much , i myself have felt the same ...Just download a software called driver booster which is free and a great soft indeed it scans for all available driver updates and installs them , also it has a game turbo power option which releases some rams for a lag free experience...

Now about the previous negetive feedbacks i would like to say about the ram that yes only 6gb is the available ram to us because of the integrated graphics but its worth it for a routine user and a normal gamer ...

Battery -: 4 hrs max on normal usage
Better not to play games on battery as it lags a lot..

About games -: Gta V works pretty well no lags till now ( make sure u connect to adaptor before playing )
About graphics -: It works truly amazing in normal and high settings ,in very high it lags sometimes because of unavailable ram space

Fps -: Average-: 59-65

Thermals-: Fan speed cannot be adjusted its automatic....Temp hardly reaches 75 degree Celsius ....Normal usage-: Nil fan sound
Gaming-: Yes causes a lot of noise and thats expected....Overall excellent thermals gives an amazing experience...

About hdd -: Till now after 1 month of usage i have not yet felt a need of ssd ,the booting time in hdd is approx 22 s , so its fine for me ...

How to turn into an absolute beast -:

If possible at least u can add a ram of additional 4gb or 8gb may be depending upon ur need , additional 4 gb ram can run gta v and other AAA title games at very high settings without lag ... However it lags at ultra settings...

SSD-: An ssd of 128 or 256gb nvme is more than enough ....

Final opinion-: Personally i loved the laptop its a great option to buy in this price range , adding a ram and ssd makes it a true Gaming beast...
Overall u can go with this lappie blindly..... :)",5
"Okay so ive been using this laptop since a few days/weeks now and i really like it
1. The display is good
2. The Laptop runs smoothly
3. Upgradable which is a big pro
4. Great sound quality
5. beautiful build
6. Games work nicely
Cons
1. A little bit slow but that can be upgraded using a ram and ssd
2. I play fortnite and rocket league on it and they run smoothly but sometimes theres a frame drop which again can be solved by ssd and ram

Overall i would really say this is a great laptop",4

"Very nice laptop in this price to do basic stuff browsing and MS office use. You get HP's name and quality. Laptop takes time at boot but that's fine you can start laptop little bit early before your work. I bought HDD version cause it gives more storage than SSD. After the start laptop runs smoothly. Nowadays 8gb ram is must, 4gb will give you sluggish performance and you'll get frustrated. Windows 10 and MS office is also good, you just need to sign in with your Microsoft login, if not you can create one. Delivery was also super fast. Overall I am happy with the purchase. Definitely a buy for students and basic works.",5

I m using this laptop last 5 days proceser was to much lag basically I am doing work from home that's why I buy this but I am choosing wrong product if I am using excel take a around 1 minimum to open excel and completely frustrated to his battery back up first day I get 3:22 hours after that I get 2:50 minutes today I plan to watch movie then full charger the laptop then he give me only 1:52 minutes I am watching movie 0 brightness and sound connect by headset but still he gives me only 1:52 hours battery back up. After searching long time I go for it but completely different I got I check the review also then I go for it but it's not good so it's your call if you go for it take time and decided if you are student Or using this for office work then plss don't go for it completely waist of time and your money also.,5
"Good laptop at this price .Go for it guys also good for coding.after completing all updates ,the laptop is soo smooth .",5
"By comparing with the all other competitors in this price range, this laptop is best in class.
Initially I thought it can't perform like i3 processor, but ryzen 3 is feeling like the another version of i5",5
I got this on 15 May 2021. Amazing performance of processor. It takes 2 to 3 secs only to start the system due to SSD. Awesome look. Fabulous display and very convenient to use even during night due to backlit keyboard. Any one can go for it without any hesitation.,5
"After too much of searching i choose this one of Best laptop if you are looking for performance, battery, design just blindly go for it. And i loved the speed of this laptop 😍",5
Laptop is very good,5
Currently purchased this laptop..Very smooth performance & good designed but disappointed with the replacement policy of flipkart as they didn't exchanged my old laptop.,4
"Very good laptop

Received on 29th May

Ordered extra wireless keyboard of dell which is beneficial

Slim and light weight laptop",5
This is super fast laptop in the budget segment. Good for school and college work. Due to SSD the speed is very fast. Can easily play games. Screen is very good but not great. Handles most of the daily work with pleasurest ease. Not sure if this can be used for video editing...but I hv seen videos which says so!!,5
"A beautiful looking laptop (like a MacBook). I upgraded from old laptop after 8 years (pentium dual core) to this one with four cores. The laptop boots in 3-4 seconds, touchpad gestures increase efficiency, keyboard is smooth too for typing.

The screen has a non-reflective matte finish which makes it good even for outdoor/bright environment.

The downside about screen is viewing angle from sides is bad. Very bad.

There is no fan in the laptop which makes it very thin and compact.

The metallic silver finish on the body makes it look expensive (which it is no doubt)

Whether it is good for gaming, I can't tell so as I mainly use it for work (ms office and web browser usage).

Battery backup time: around 7-8 hours on normal use.",4
"One of the best budget laptop, optimal for office use, if you are looking for fast and minimal laptop under 50k, I will strongly suggest you all to go for this laptop blindly.",5
"Laptop is really great. Before buying I was in confusion between Ryzen and Intel. After 7 days of usage, I felt no difference. I continuously use my laptop for office and movies at least 10 hours a day and didn't e even notice any heating problem. If you are looking for a laptop below 45k with good performance, just go for it.",4
Genuine product 😇😇😇😇😇,5
"1. display 4star
2. sound 5star

4. keyboard 5star
5. battery 4star
over all review 4 star
i bought for 45,990
but now it is 50,000 which is not actually value for money.
if it is available for 45000 aprox definately go for it.
good for student office use home use .",4
Best laptop,5
"nice product! Looks classy, superfast. But LAN port is missing in the laptop that's might be problematic for some people. Otherwise overall best in this price range with the given configurations.",5
Excellent,5
Best laptop.,5
"It's a good laptop with no issue as such ! Screen is IPS good viewing angles ! Battery is decent 4-5hr easily!
Build quality is good previously i was using HP 14s i3 11th gen, the quality was poor, though it is a good laptop when it comes to performance.
The only issue is it's VRAM which is 512mb quite low !! You can't play GTA V in even 720p, which is possible in i3 11th gen which can play it in 1080p.
Rest it's a good piece of hardware.",5
Looks is fine... Easy to carry! But can't play a normal 4k video from pendrive and there is no antiglare display. So in sunlight or in normal bright light you might face some issues. Otherwise it's a good choice.,4
"It has been 20 days i am using this laptop , no doubt it is a good laptop with decent performance and good battery life of 6 -7hours. But i have noticed few cons
1- It's design is good ,it is sleek but still it is not so sturdy , i find it delicate and should be handled with care.
2- It has only two USB slots sometimes this becomes a big problem.
3- Although it has full hd screen but it is very reflective in low Brightness you can see your face and things in background. I don't understand why they haven't given antiglare in 38 k.
4- No Backlit keyboard. I thought hp will provide it in 21.
Apart from these Minor issues rest of the things are good.",5
"I wanted a backup system (to work during thunderstorm) for work and didn't want to spend much. I got it for 39000 without any offers but still satisfied with my purchase. The processor, ram and ssd combination is good enough for web development. I didn't face any lag while coding in vs code. Used photoshop and illustrator as well. Display is too good. Built with plastic but still seems steady.",4
"Pros:
1. Display is really good.
2. It's compact and Lightweight
3. It's better for Programming and development work in this price range (37 K)
4. Multitasking is good and smooth.
5. Booting start within 4-6 sec.
6. Restart within 12-18 sec.
7. Genuine Windows with Microsoft Office
8. Battery back-up is descent
9. Perfect for student

Cons:
1. Fan position is very bad. Display get warm by hot air flow (Who's the architect???)
2. Camera quality is not so good
3. Voice recording is also little bit noisy
4. Internal storage is only upgradable by replacing. no extra slot
5. Not for gaming",4
"Good laptop at this price range you will get ryzen3 4300u which will perform all your task smoothly.This laptop also comes with 500gb ssd which bootd laptop very fast.this laptop is worth for medium level gaming and can also handle your day to day task.
If you want more features then you can go for ryzen 3 5300u model which has more advanced feature at just 41k so go for it instead if you want more features and performance",5
This is good one in this price range. You can buy it. Look is classy and having good configuration. Easy to use and robust design.,5
"I've used this laptop for last 3 weeks and it proves to be exceptionally good. I had little bit doubt about Ryzen as it's my first experiment with it. But it's actually better than Intel i3. The battery is good as well, mid-end games doesn't drain it speedily. Just one problem that I've faced is- the screen is not 180 degree flexible and glares can be seen at times.",4
One of the best value laptops out there in the budget range. Possibly an entry level gaming laptop which can play a good game at the normal or low settings perhaps with an additional 8gb Ram. I took it for home use and for kids for their online classes. It has not failed me and quite happy with the deal.,5
"The following cons and pros are keeping the price bracket in mind.

Cons:
1) Build quality is pretty poor. Feels like a toy.
2) Keyboard is horrible. It's not a pleasant experience typing
on this.
3) Trackpad feels cheaper than the price paid.

Pros:
1) App loading times and boot times are snappy with the
SSD.
2) Performance is solid
3) Sound quality is decent.
4) Display has decent brightness.

Overall good for 1st time users but if you have used a half decent ...",4
"I was confused between asus and lenovo s145 laptop but chose go with this laptop because of build quality.

Lenovo s145 feels quite flimsy while asus is reinforced with metal plates under the keyboard and in side supports of screen.

4gb ram and ryzen 3250u is good for everyday uses and light office work like browsing with5-6 tab oepn in chrome and 2-3 office files and for heavy uses there option to increase ram capacity.

Ssd read speeds are quite fast 950mb/s and write speed upto 350mb/s therefore it feels quite snappy and there is option to add hdd later for more storage(bracket provided inside).

Also the screen display quality(ips-level(asus) vs TN(lenovo)) and brightness is better 250 nits compared to 220 nits of s145.",5
"Absolutely great product. Beautiful design, the ips level display.... Absolutely stunning. Packaging was secure too.

Now lets come to the performance. The SSD inside it gives the performance a big boost. 4 gigs of ram is sufficient for light multitasking (I'll add 4gigs of ram later). The laptop boots up in just 6-7 sec, and there's no lag in app opening and closing.

Battery performance is good I'd say. I was typing a document in MS word, and the laptop only consumed 6% of the battery in 45 minutes. Yet to test the battery when connected to internet.

For students its a very good laptop. Within 32k you're getting ms office, windows 10 Home, everything.

Only one disclaimer - This is not a gaming laptop, so don't try to play games. Will update the review time to time.

Edit: Great battery backup! 6-7 hours in normal usage (without internet) and 3-4 hours while connected to internet. And the laptop doesn't heat much even if you're doing heavy tasks. Normal heating is observed, and the cooling fan is really silent.

Thank you ASUS and flipkart for this great value for money product! For day to day tasks, and for sometimes heavy usage, it's really that great.",5
4k videos lags a little bit. At this price segment we don't get much to complain about. Otherwise fast enough,5
Sach a wonderful laptop 💻,4
First day of use...Update my review after use of one week...,5
Good laptop Power full but it's body is plastic,5
Best budget for this price range,5
Superb laptop,5
Excellent laptop thankyou flipkart,5
Great product,5
"I PURCHASED LAPTOP 1 MONTH BACK AND NOW I AM FACING BATTERY/SOME HARDWARE ISSUE. LAPTOP BATTERY IS NOT CHARGING. I LOCKED CASE WITH ACER SUPPORT BUT NO PROPER RESPONSE, GENERIC STATEMENTS, I AM WAITING SINCE 8 DAYS AND STILL NO ONE ATTENDED THE TROUBLE SHOOTING CALL, NO LINK FOR CASE TRACKING, I AM COMPLETELY UNAWARE ABOUT MY CASE STATUS. THE LINK THEY HAVE PROVIDED IS NOT WORKING. PRODUCT IS GOOD BUT SUPPORT IS REALLY POOR AND I MUST SAY PLEASE CHECK MY REVIEW BEFORE BUYING ACER PRODUCTS.",5
"My first impression and One day full usage.
1. The very fist thing i was impressed was the Design and build quality. Very very satisfying design The surface are smooth matte finished. Very hardly fingerprints would pickup. Though the material is plastic, you would never feel bad.
2. The hinge was very thin and of good quality. You can lift it off with one finger. You can flex your hinge to flat upto 180degree.
3. Display, I think this is one of the best display for this budget. FHD anti glare Ips panel lcd display . Brightness was very good. Colors in the display are very accurate. Viewing angle is very good. Even you can view this at 180 degree. No bleeding issue. Black colours are enough darker without any noticeable screen bleeding. According to me, Side bezels are big. If possible, they could have given with narrow side bezels and also top bezels.
4. Camera - Very very poor camera, if you buy a 20k budget laptop, You would find this camera there. I expected some more, but disappointed. VGA camera, No HD.
5. Battery- For a full charge, computer can on for about more than 6 hours. If you do multitasking it may reduce according to your usage. But general for browsing and media work (no gaming) it last for about 3hr to 4hr. But for gaming less than 2 hr and it also not recommended to game without the charger.
6. Thermal - It has heating issue. You can't have this computer on your lap . It heats up while File transferring, multitasking, Internet streaming. Very poor thermal conduct. I didn't find any fan noise. But ut heats up a lot.
7. Weight- It weighs a lot. It is tough to hold on your lap or while you lay on your bed.
8. Ram - Amd vega r8 Integrated graphics occupies 2gb of 8gb vram. Installing additional ram is recommended for gaming.
9. Rom - 512gb ssd plays a good role here. Really boots up faster. And application opens up faster. But for file transfer, i didn't find any fast. I don't know why, I hardly find 10mbps. On average, It has a speed of less than 10mbps. By default when i open for first time, only 476gb was available.
10. Software- Windiws 10 was good. It has norton antivirus but free only for 30 days. And it has pre installed Ms word, Ppt, Excel, without subscription.
11. Speakers - Initially, speakers are very very poor. I was really disappointed. By default, it has Realtek Audio drivee, Though it gives less sound. I've installed other Audio drivers. Now somewhat imoroved but not satisfied. Speakers were given under the two sides.

Processor, Graphics card are quite right for this budget. The performance is good.

Demerits that I personally found are
1. Heating issue
2. Sound quality
3. Excess Weight.
I bought this laptop for 49k.",4
"Laptop is good at 8gb ram. After I've upgraded it to 16gb. It's working absolutely Great.
I play PUBG on Smooth Extreme and it's totally smooth.
I've tried HD and Extreme and it works fine but heats so i orefer smooth and Extreme.
Upgrade Ram to 16gb and It'll be very fast.
Btw it boots within 10seconds.",5
"Everything is best.
In this price range it is beast. Boot up speed upto 6 seconds . Display is awesome there is no screen bleeding problem. Resulation is also good. Build quality also good. Sound is enough for a single room not so bad it's good.
Lastly I want to say that if you want to buy a budget gaming laptop then you should go for it.
Wait for more update after using few days ☺️
AFTER USING 6 DAYS-
1. SOUND IS ENOUGH FOR A ROOM. BUT IF YOU DONT SATISFIED IN THAT SOUND SO PLEASE DOWNLOAD FXSOUND .
2. BOOTING TIME MAXIMUM 6 SECONDS.
3.SCREEN QUALITY AWESOME. THERE IS NO SCREEN BLEEDING ISSUES.

I LOVED THIS PRODUCT.",4
"First i thought it would reach me soon but it took a week
My opinion about this laptop after one day of use
Being a cs student this is perfect Laptop for me battery is good display is good but the sound is too low which can be neglected if u r not a Movie Holic person over all performance is good
I will review again after using it for a month",5
"Best laptop for this price range. Good for both programming and gaming. Also it arrived before the estimated date which is really good👍👍👍👍

Edit(after 3 days of use) - Battery not that good. If i keep the laptop open from 100%battery...it gets upto 80% within 10 mins. Also I was using VS Code and the battery drained from 100% to 40% in battery saver mode within 1 hour. OVERALL THIS LAPTOP IS A BEAST FOR THIS RANGE.",5
"Very good performance laptops this range. Fast charging, display so good, overall quality wise good. Very fast booting and shutting down.",5
"Here are some pros and cons about this laptop
PROS:-

1. Performance is clearly outstanding with Ryzen 5 3550H ( definitely better than i5 10th gen 10210U )
2. The build quality is just amazing, although being a gaming laptop it's quite light weight
3. It's not metal but feels premium when you hold
4. The display is also good with IPS FHD ( 250 nits brightness ), and good viewing angles
5. The battery backup is pretty good with 5-6 hrs on normal usage like YouTube or browsing and 3 hrs on gaming ( depends on usage )
6. NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1650 4 GB under 50K is a golden deal
7. SSD storage ( 10 times better than HDD )
8 It doesn't heats up horribly like Asus TUF

CONS:-
1. The speaker output was not that great but it's ok regarding price point. But you have to use external speaker or headphones for better sound
2. No fingerprint scanner
3. No MS office

WHO SHOULD BUY:-
Although it's a gaming laptop, but you can use it for multiple things like:-
1. Video editing
2. Programming and Coding ( Android studio runs well )
3. Heavy gaming

It's the best laptops for students under 50k

I bought it for 44,990 in big billion days and I'm satisfied with the purchase",4
Best budget laptop with gtx1650ti to play heavy games with easy more than 60fps and with ssd it boots up within 4-5 secs. I play valorant and get 150fps easily with competitive settings. It's a great budget gaming laptop you won't be disappointed with it at this price,5
"A 3rd gen Ryzen, GTX 1650Ti( GDDR6 ), 8 GB Ram, 512GB storage and an full HD screen, If these are the primary specs you want in your Laptop this
laptop has got you covered in 50-55k range.
This laptop is good for gaming on medium settings and a little bit of light editing. Thermals are good depending on usage, my usage is limited to only for ms office work, some photo editing on photoshop and little bit of coding. In a day2day usage this laptop has everything. The side bezels are thin which I got used to. A little bit heavy for carrying around. And also it has an expansion slot for ram.

But there are some minor things which I couldn't ignore :
1.Battery:
Only 48 Whr 3-cell battery for this power hungry machine is not enough which lasts only 3-4hr for heavy workload like photoshop. So use it with a charger.

2.No fingerprint:
Most of options are offering fingerprint sensor so it would have been better. But in the competition only this one is offering 1650Ti which is better imo.

3.Ryzen5:
Its been almost a year since Ryzen 4000 series was lunched but still those are nowhere to be found and those which are available are out of budget range and not worth the bang for the buck so this is only left good but could be better.

4.No accessories included(at least a laptop bag or a sleeve case would be good).

5.No dedicated lights for numlock, capslock(there is a software for that). Really annoyed didn't expected this.

Overall this one is a great value for money laptop because of specs it is offering and also acer is little underrated compared to hp and Dell which are overpriced and not value for money in comparison.",4
"I was a little sceptical about the display but it is a great display. performance and thermals are good too, get a crucial 16gb ram stick and you are good to go
the speaker is a little underwhelming but that is the case with every laptop. I will recommend buying 2 years extended warranty via shopacer just for the peace of mind
buy this ryzen 5 version because its a 12nm processor and offers just a little extra battery life compared to the intel counterpart. overall a great purchase",4
"Following Review is based on 35 days of recurrent use for Gaming and Other Complex computation purposes.
+After 2 months of patience and rigorous research for a budget laptop, I found this to be the only one packed with 4 Gigs VRAM, 8 Gigs of RAM which is easily the minimum requirement for most of the PC Games. And yes, Most of them run silky smooth with over 35 Fps on Medium to High Graphics Preset. I tired, Witcher 3, GTA5, Dyling Light, Just Cause 4, Watch Dogs 2 also simulators like Train Sim 2020 and Euro Truck run pretty much very good. On Ultra and Very High presets. Frame rate will stutter.
+For some, the price would be considerably high, but this laptop is at the peak in this range.
+I use dual boot, Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10, Fast boot is still consistent.
+For people expecting this PC for better training time for ML/DL models, I'd say its moderately acceptable for beginners or trainees to start with smaller smaller datasets, it'll do the job just fine. Else even 8-16 Gigs of Vram is less for training state of the art models.
+Display couldn't be better. Backlit Keyboard is very much helpful at all times.


-No indication for CAPS & NUM LOCK really is painful sometimes, but with regular use you'll adjust to it.
-I would've really loved a physical button for booting up but it's just like any other buttons embedded onto the upper right of the keyboard.
-GPU heats a lot, more than you could expect. It won't hinder with the Gaming experience but trust me, it'll make you uncomfortable to see your Laptop heat.
Probably the ventilation structure isn't good.
-Battery Drains fast, I'd recommend using it with charger plugged in everytime if possible.
Lastly After I'd very much recommend the Ryzen 5th Generation variant of you could invest another 4K-5K in this, if not go with this, make it an asset cause it's very capable of being one.

Thank You for reading till the end :-)",4
"Excellent product and definitely worth more than the price. Getting a GTX 1650 Ti in 4 GB graphics and many other features makes this a blinder to go for. I'm a college student and I use this for software simulation and E-learning purpose. I've been using this for a week now. The backlit keyboard ( which many of the competitors do not provide at this range) , 48Whr 3 cell battery with 135W fast charging adapter, ETHERNET jack, AMD Ryzen 5 3550H processor , 8 GB ram expandable upto 32 GB and 512 GB Nvme PCl3 SSD storage ( boot time and switch off time are less than 7 seconds),which can be replaced by 1 TB SSD slot, 15.6 inches FHD screen are the primary details that'll surely make you think this costs above 65k atleast. That's how worth this lap is. Only con that i found was the sound quality. But let's be honest Many laptops in the current market compromises sound quality except a few. There is always a sale available for this product where the price will drop to less than 53K.",5
"I was bit sceptical on purchase of this costly Laptop kind of electronic item online.but gave a shot and I must say the product arrived before the date given and packed properly.

The product was absolutely in perfect condition,and working. The seal wasn't broken and seller ensured every thing was intact in package as per the Laptop Company. Acer.

The laptop is great as I am using past one week.
The processor Ryzen5 , Nvidia 1650ti and a solid built laptop by acer and that too a reasonable priced one is sure a eye opener.

Screen is fine and I did not feel the brightness low .Can be for other user.

Overall I am super happy with the Acer product and service of Flipkart.",5
"Awesome laptop. Price to performance

Pros:
1. Lightening fast performance in gaming and other tasks. Play older games from 2015 at ultra settings and new games on medium to high at 50-60fps.
2.backlight keyboard
3. Camera is good for video call

Cons:
1. Battery is not up to the mark
2. Sound is super low
3. Screen is not vibrant but good for this price

Note: please play games with charging on. DO NOT use laptop on bed or couch because it would resist airflow and will lead to hardware issues.",5
"Good laptop for average use .gaming not tested . available storage is only 415 out of 475gb,you have to buy external hard disk to store some information.buid quality is not much impressive but ok .over all good buying",4
"Arrived on time. Packaging was good. With the ssd, average boot time is 4-5sec. Display is pretty well and gives at lest 100fps in max settings on games like Valorant. Really satisfied with the product👍🏻",5
"first of all very fast delivery by flipkart received in 2 days
amazing speed
Good design does not look like a heavy gaming laptop although it is a gaming laptop
Graphics 1650Ti is brilliant at this price point
boots in less than 5 seconds
white backlit keyboard is soothing
screen rotates 180℃",5
"Things that I would like to tell you about -

1). 🅸🅿🆂 🅻🅴🆅🅴🅻 🅳🅸🆂🅿🅻🅰🆈 Read attentively the info about display ,it is written ips level display not Ips display.I did some digging and found that ips level display is not good as ips display but I did not found the differences very significant .so you can go with this display.

2). 🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈. I think that Battery back up is worse than any other laptop 😂.This laptop lives for only 2 hr on normal usage(browsing ,u tube etc ) with medium brightness level.
.
3)webcam quality is not good ,why do they write 720p in webcam spec 😂.

4)HEATING ISSUE -Many of you might be wondering that the positioning of air vents may harm the screen .yes , I am concerned about it too and yes, the lower screen heated by hot air . So nothing could be said about its durability .But I came up with a desi jugaad , I've put card board there to deflect the air and it inhibits the air to heat up the screen .😂

5)PERFORMANCE. )(BEAST) -Now the main reason you are considering 🥵this laptop .Amazing specs at this price . This laptop functions very smoothly👍 ,I have tried gaming ,amazing experience .
BOOT TIME Is also very less around 7-8 sec .impressive huh!!
Fingerprint sensor is also very fast.


6)bulit quality is quite good but the lower face of laptop (floor facing side ) is not built by good material ,it May break if you are one of those people who don't care much of their laptops.
You have to be careful and should clean it daily ,this laptop catches daag dhabbe very fast .😓


SO IF U CAN ADJUST WITH BAD BATTERY BACKUP AND AIR VENTS . WANT A LAPTOP WITH BEAST PERFORMANCE .THIS LAPTOP IS FOR YOU.",5
"I received the laptop today on 31-05-2021, it's a decent looking laptop. Weight doesn't feel too much and looks slim too.
I tried to get the technical specifications for this laptop after ordering but cannot find this specific model even on official Asus website. Flipkart also not listed many details like screen refresh rate, HDD and RAM upgradeability etc. So for future buyers here is the exact technical specifications-

CPU - Intel Core i5 9300H (45W TDP)
GPU- nVidia GTX 1650 4GB
RAM- 8GB DDR4 2400MHz soldered (running in single channel) + 1 Empty RAM slot
SSD- Intel 660p 512GB NVMe SSD
HDD- Empty space for 2.5in HDD
Display- Full HD IPS Level display at 60Hz with excellent viewing angle, looking beautiful

Overall it's a good laptop, only issue is Heating, air vents throw air directly to display. Hope Asus engineers have designed it after checking the heat effect on screen.

Will update about performance and gaming after using it for some time.",4
Awesome gaming Laptop in this price range...i got this for 53k on no cost emi.. Playing gta5 comfortably on this...Battery is decent...But overall good product and definitely 5 stars for value for money,5
"Got this laptop on 31st may 2021...got it just at 53k... yes price got hiked the very next day to 59k and 56k its just fluctuating

Pros - Display, booting speed, streaming videos built quality is great... premium looks, and offcourse gaming legend it is.....this laptop don't know what is heating...just it heat slights while gaming...but overall good deal... worth it...and also my asus app is a best thing...and when fan turns on at performance mode..it wil be more amazing than exhaust firing of sports car....gta 5 runs like butter....

Cons - Battery....else nothing but it doesn't matter...it gaming laptop...we cannot expect for a mango, from a neem tree right....and a bit 60hz display....but will not affect much",5
"Everything is great ...they must have specified the refresh rate ,on flipkart they have shown 120hz refresh rate but it has 60hz refresh rate so don't get confused .display quality and processing is Amazing. I encountered only 2 drawback ..its camera quality is very poor( and i mean it)and 2 nd one thy must have specified the refresh rate ,i bought it only because of 120hz diplay ...🐱🐱🐱 but after all its a good package at this price ...u r getting 100%srgb ,ms office nd one extra slot for ram and hdd.",5
"Very nice device I have used it will come for 2hrs for classes 100 to 0 will consume
And gaming performance is very nice
I can play free fire with 60fps no lag there it will run very smoothly and display is very nice",5
"Typing this review on my new Asus Vivobook F571G. Received it yesterday and totally in love with this beast!

PROS:
1. Display is crystal clear and top notch. Video quality is very crisp, 1440p, 2160p all work like a charm.
2. Loved the build quality. It looks ultra premium. My cousin has an HP laptop which is expensive than mine but the build quality of her laptop is horrible. Its made of plastic and looks very cheap whereas Asus looks damn premium!
3. NVIDIA GeForce 1650 GTX is a beast and games run like butter.
4. Sound quality is amazing thanks to Harman Kardon sound system, which is absent in other brands.
5. Fingerprint sensor is rapid fast.
6. Intel i5 9th Gen + SSD is what makes it rapid fast. It opens up in 4-5 seconds.

CONS:
Literally none. Yes the battery backup is very average but it still is decent. Gives 3-4 hours on normal working and about 1-1.5 hrs on heavy usage. However I would recommend to plug in the charger and then use the laptop when gaming.

ICING ON THE CAKE: I got this beast at a price of just Rs. 42500! Got a great exchange value of Rs. 8550 on my 5 years old Asus A555L laptop, 6000 additional discount during sale, 1000 using HDFC credit card and saved 969 using Flipkart supercoins. Even if we remove supercoin it just costed me 43400. Loved Asus' resale value and if anyone has old laptop they can exchange it while buying a new one as it saves a lot of money.

I am very happy with the purchase and will strictly recommend to just go for it! This the most budget friendly gaming laptop you'll ever get!",5
"ASUS Vivobook is great a value for money. Good for commuting daily work along with gaming also. Awesome design. Product quality if good.Only reason for not giving 5start is low battery backup, which get exhausted often.",4
"Laptop is quite good with decent look, I played gta 5 with high settings(on charge) I feel no lag in the game, I must tell that gaming laptops basically don't provide good battery back up, it's like going for sports bike and concern about mileage 😂, overall I'm 8n love with product",5
Nice product and it is very much fast in processing. I like it,5
"Good design.
Battery initially gives reasonable backup of 6-7 hours, but may reduce on prolonged use.
Display is not good but manageable as it seems a bit faded.
Hinge is not the strongest , as I have been used to strong build quality of dell laptops.
Boot up and memory use is fast due to SSD.
Processor is also good.
All in all a value for money product as I got it for 40k",5
"Best laptop in this price range. The ryzen 5 4500u is really a beast. I have purchased this mainly for doing android development and dual booted it with linux mint, surprisingly I can run android studio, emulator, and chrome simultaneously without any lag. And one more interesting things is that it gives you more performance while it is plugged in on AC adapter.

The dedicated graphics memory(VRAM) is 512MB only, definately it is not for gaming purposes, but if you are thinking to do development/programming/coding using this laptop, then you can blindly trust on it.",5
"Well laptop is blazing fast but the display is on warmer side which make viewing bad. Rest specifications are top notch. Dual band wifi 5ghz and 2.5ghz. Look is sublime and weight of this lappy is light. Supports 4k movies without lag that was unexpected. Fingerprint is very fast and accurate. Backlight keyboard. Wifi 6. I got 90 mpbs
Speed with my wifi. Totally loving it
At last this laptop is terminator.
Thanks flipkart for secured and safe delivery of product
#AWESOME #ASUS",5
"Loved the laptop's performance. It's fast, smooth and doesn't lag. But the display is below average. Web cam quality is also not very impressive. No heating issue, satisfied with the battery backup, and the premium look.

Overall, it's worth buying. Got it for under 45k.",5
"Used it for a week. I bought it knowing that the display is not really great, so not dissapointed. It is a good device for the price if processing power is your top most priority.

Performance - 5/5 : Very powerful, processor infact the most powerful in this price bracket. Very smooth so far, no lags found. I did not play any games. Boots up in 5-6 secs. SSD is of average speed.

Screen - 2.5/5 : It is a TFT panel, thus the colours and viewing angles are not that good. Also the colour tuning is really dissapointing. I did some colour tuning and it looks much better but the screen is still not good. Also not very bright, so outdoor usage won't be a good experience.

Speakers - 3.75/5 : Average, good enough for a medium sized room. When there are not much external noises, I use it around 60-70% of the volume. Also the mic is decent, can be used for video calls if necessary.

Keyboard - 3/5 : A bit flimsy.

Build Quality - 4/5 : Light weight. Plastic body, but decent in quality. The hinge is not very confidence giving.

Thermal management - 5/5 : Thanks to the processor it is very good. Even on heavy tasks the fan did not rev up.

Battery life - 3.5/5 : Gets around 5 hours on normal usage. It charges to 100% in around 1hrs 15 mins.

Fingerprint scanner is fast and accurate.

I faced some issues with fingerprint scanner and audio jack initially, but got solved with driver update.

Packaging - 1/5: Fast delivery but the packaging is very poor, no bubble wraps or anything of that sort fro protection. Just the branded box in a larger box.",4
"This a great laptop for programmers or people who need a laptop with great processor and speed.
The design is great, it is sleek and feature loaded.

The only problem is the display. It's color correctness is not good and text on the screen looks blurry due to the font.",4
"Purchased this Laptop at 42990/- in Big Billion day sale. At this price point this laptop seems to be amazing.

Pros:
Sleek and slim design.
Ryzen5 4500U is awesome.
Finger Print works amazingly fast with windows Hello support.
Boot up time is good.

Cons:
Display quality is worst.
The build material is plastic.
Ram is not upgradable.",4
"Having now used this laptop for a week, I've found it to be an all round brilliant laptop that runs smoothly with no hiccups. This is perfect for those on a tight budget like me, who want a laptop for work, browsing the internet and watching videos, including a lil bit of video editing band gaming. As it's slim & lightweight with an acute design it's great for those on the go. The 8 GB RAM is definitely sufficient for those who just want to do what I mentioned above. The display is decent (use dark theme), also made to look great by the thin bezels; as well as the sleek finish; and the fingerprint sensor works blazing fast in this price range and unlocks pretty quickly. I was quite happy with the speakers; it was in fact better than I expected; crisp and clear audio. You also don't need to worry about the battery, as I've found it lasts around 6 hours. There is also a pre-installed MyAsus feature which can be very useful for looking after the laptop.

The only negative I found was that the MS Office provided is just a trial version which means you have to buy a complete package of your own, well for me, I'm going to install a no price, cracked version of Office 2019 Pro Plus.
I definitely would recommend this for all those on a budget, because I guarantee you will not find much better laptops for this price.",5
"Bought this laptop for Rs. 35,690 during the Big Billion Day Sale, applied the SBI card discount as well as exchanged my old Asus R558U i5 6th gen laptop for this one. It's worth every penny.

The performance and design are the absolute best in this price (even at 50k) and you'll be blown away by the Hex Core Ryzen 5 4500u which is the beast powering this laptop. The keys are chiclet style and are good quality, no issues there. The top has a nice white colour and has a slight matte style finish so no fingerprint smudge issues...
The fingerprint scanner is blazing fast and the trackpad is good quality as well.

Coming on to the inbuilt webcam, its a standard 720p camera that is sufficient enough for standard video calls, google meet sessions or online classes... It's not bad by any means but could've been better.

Now the display... Yes it's unfortunately the weakest link of this laptop as it's a TN panel but at least it's 1080p FHD. The brightness is 220 nits at max and offers mediocre viewing angles, but it's okay for watching movies and standard/basic stuff... The display is mediocre at best but still much better than my old 2015 laptop so I'm not complaining :P

Another con is that this laptop DOES NOT come with MS Office 2019 lifetime license nor does come with McAfee antivirus lifetime license, both software are given with 1 month trial though.

If you want colour accuracy and photo driven work, this is not for you... But for office goers or students this laptop is highly recommended and will not disappoint at all.",5
"Performance:4/5, No issues till date, this is a pretty decent laptop to work with as ryzen 4000 series is simply smooth.

Battery:4/5, not the best in the category, but gets the work done, 6 hours in normal usage and 3-4 hours when I extensively used android studio.

Display:2/5 , dissappointed. Not a very good display, gets the work done but doesn't provide you that emersive experience. It's fine for people who are not into gaming and video editing, people like me who just use laptops for coding and development purposes.

Design: 4/5, flattered. This is a very sleek laptop and gives a premium look when you hold it. Though the body is made of plastic, but feels really sturdy and dependable.

Overall. I had idea about the display, I still went for it considering the performamce, design and size. This laptop is simply the best deal I could get at 45k during the big billion days sale. The display holds back a bit but it is managable at this price point considering all the good things embeded in it.",4
"Excellent value for the price.
So the laptop arrived after 3 days and was inside 3 boxes. Coming to the review:
8GB ram is a bit less, should definitely upgrade to 16GB. However, it has warranty sticker om top of one of the screws, so I don't know if you can upgrade it yourself. Acer service center will charge you 8k for the ram upgrade (P.S. - I personally went there and checked).
Coming to the laptop the hinges of the laptop rotate 180°, but are on the lose side if you compare it with other laptops.
The audio quality is pathetic, will recommend to use a Bluetooth speaker or headphones for better audio quality.
Apart from this, performance is top notch, it does get noticeably hot while gaming, an external fan is required for keeping thermals low.
Overall if you ignore a few things here and there a great value for the price you are paying.",4
"A really value for money purchase imo. Tried Shadow of Tomb Raider - got 60 fps at medium high.
Some pointers regarding the product:
1- it does not have a finger print sensor as it's 1650 counterpart
2- you may claim free games from Intel by googling ""softwareoffers Intel"" (this keeps changing regularly, currently cuphead, Cyclist, world of worships and Gear Tactics along with Trial version of Origin pass is being provided)
3- Download Geforce Experince from Nvidia's site for better optimisation of games and getting updates.
4- acer care has an option in the battery settings to set the max charge level to 80%. Great for long life.
5- Fn lock is enabled by default.
6- although the colors aren't being claimed as great, the display is absolutely beautiful, the text and games look beautiful
7- sound's not the loudest but decent, don't expect bass tho.
8- ""warranty void if seal is broken"" sticker is predent under the laptop, incase you thought of adding an extra ram stick on your own.
9- the charger is quite a big one but is pretty decent.
10- the vents on right can get warm during gaming, keep your hand away from the vent (right hand mouse)
11- usb type c is only for connecting and not for charging.

Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. I would however recommend the seller/flipkart to update the photos to remove the one with ""fingerprint"" to reduce confusion.

I'd recommend.",5
Waited four days for this laptop man! i5 9th gen paired with Gtx 1650ti performance is very good. Battery is sufficient. Gaming on this laptop is good can run anything. I was able to play game around 45mins -55mins on Battery(with Nvdia Battery 30fraps locked on) its works like a charm and is super silent but when u plug the power cable for better performance its gets hot while gaming but thts normal.Even the sound is more than good enough. Many says sound is not good but bro its more than good enough. Build quality is good.and yes no fingerprint sensor like the Other Acer Aspire Gtx 1650 laptop.,4
Acer aspire 7 is one of the best gaming laptop with affordable cost when compared with other gaming laptops GTA 5 goes butterly smooth without any lag you can play it with 1080 resolution. Screen of the laptop is Full HD display and it's awesome .Battery of the laptop is 4hrs with full brightness and with online . U can expand it but turning on battery saver and low brightness with 5hrs .but while gaming the battery lasts only for 1-2hrs. If battery not an issue u can better go with . The laptop speaker is not much noisy infact the sound speaker not much audible,4
"This laptop is pocket friendly for casual gamers.....we can say that it is the cheapest gaming laptop......the features are excellent for that price point......
The overall build quality is great, though it looks simple it is a beast in performance.
I have been using this laptop from past 20 days and have observed-
1. The display screen has a yellow tinge, but it's not a problem

2. The sound is a bit low.

3. There is a connectivity issue with this laptop and the TP- link router model no. TL-WR84N1. At least this is what I faced- the WiFi network used to drop and I found out that the router is not compatible with this laptops driver (Atheros WiFi driver).....I am using a TP link USB WiFi adapter and now there is no issue with the connectivity....
(It is the problem with the router and not the laptop)

4. There is no heating problem and I have played continuously for 5 hours without facing much problem.(keep it on a flat surface and not on mattress or lap)

5. I would suggest to upgrade the ram with another 8gb stick to make it 16 GB total....for better performance.

6. Battery does last long (7-8 hours) if using for working purpose. And for gaming, always connect the power cable for better performance.

Love this laptop, beast....",5

"Was worried a lot about buying a laptop on flipkart as this was my first time to order a huge amount... But I’m very happy. Fantastic Laptop in today’s Date.. Just go for it blindly. Some people says that Cooling system and speakers are bad. But i don’t think so.. That’s the best laptop in this budget. While playing GTA 5 , GPU temperature was about average 45-48 Celcius and CPU temperature was about Average 65-70 celcius and FPS was 60+ which was making buttery smooth experience. However you can increase FPS in a control setting. Overall 100/100 for this laptop👍🏻",5
"Recieved the product 2 dayS earlier thanks to flipkart.

Laptop is awesome at this price range

FHD IPS display is great

Fast as hell

I got 432Gb free to use

I5 I'd better that ryzen 5 in aspire 7

Only problem is:
only one ssd slot and speaker sound is low",5
Such a nice laptop it is beast for me and the battery backup is also nice or grafics card 1650ti is so better than 1650 so buy it value for money product 50990 rs so awesome price I know the price of this laptop 1week ago is 49990 but no problem buy it,5
"I purchased this laptop on 18 February 2021, got delivered by 23 February 2021. Had to pick the laptop myself from the EKART hub, since delivery person couldn't take laptop for delivery.

Make sure to make a video while unboxing, so in case any damages to the product, you get easy replacement.

I unboxed, and alas, it was so beautiful. Make sure to check all the ports, usbs, any scratches or fingerprints. Now you may end the video making.

Plug into your charging, and on the laptop. SSD boots up super quick in 2 seconds you have home screen. Setup your Windows 10, and update it. It would be between 500 mb to 1gb I think. Make sure to register your product via the SNID (serial number) in the Acer website to start your warranty Status. IPS is super beautiful, however you may experience some sort of screen bleeding, normal in IPS, and never noticible in games and movies. After installing necessary drivers, application and bitdefender, I get 4.7 gb ram on a regular basis. That MAY seem to bottleneck the device sometimes, and you may not do multitasking WHILE playing games, however games won't have any lags or frame drops. RAM supports 2666 mhz, so get yourself one extra 8 gb. Speakers were decent, webcam and mic were decent. Keyboard, trackpads and backlight was amazing.

Gaming seems beautiful, till now I have played Medal of Honor Warfighter and Battlefield 1 at Ultra and got 60 fps (locked). I have installed Acer Predator sense to control the fan speed to max and GPU clocking to max during gaming.",5
"Good product. Delivered 2 days in advance of originally committed date. Very good packaging. Appreciate the service. Product is good as specified, light weight, screen is bright and attractive.",5
"An honest review after using the laptop continuously for 3 days. In the beginning the laptop had some heating issues but they were solved by the 2nd day. The laptop is a 14 inch one which is easy to carry and handle. Also it is sleek which gives it a good look. The keypad is good but the mouse pad is a little flimsy. It could be better. There are no specific left and right keys for the mouse, it's just a blunt touch pad with left and right clicking systems.

The laptop works fine. It starts in 4-5 secs. And it is able to bear continuous working as well.

All in all, if you want a budget laptop with keypad backlight, you could go for this.",4
Amazing,5
"After a detailed study I have purchased this laptop. If you want to buy a complete laptop for official use and online classes, go for it without any doubts. Excellent display,super fast booting and soothing sound. Overall it wouldn't make you regret after buying.",4
"It is a good buy.
Better battery backups
Better performance
Looks & design fantastic.",5
Nice one😊❤️,5
Classy product,5
Good product,5
"Very good product.
Sound little bit low. But OK.
Otherwise very good as I found till now.

I shall update if required after using it regularly.",5
Vlaue for money,5
"Excellent Product By hp but everyone knows that something is always missing by the brand to fo price Cut which is a SSD. If hp provide SSD then it is the best in class and performance. Ram available 7.9 GB. But speed is very very slow because of 7200 RPM tosiba HDD. Didn't do multitasking with this HDD it's always stuck while open chrome or even Edge. very SLOW and LAGGY. So if you want to buy this laptop then buy an SSD with it then also you get the lag free performance.

Performance -- 3/5 because of SSD only which is the biggest drawback of this laptop.

Display -- 4/5 for anti-glare 1080p IPS display which is very bright.

CPU -- 4/5 in this range because this is the first i3 clocked at 3.0ghz and turbo upto 4.1 which is best.

Ram -- 3/5Samsung 8g 2668 MHz which good but here also hp cut their cost because i3 11 th gen support 3200 MHz and like dell and other brand gave that ram.

Battery -- 3/5 41WH quite descent but if it's 47wh bcs asus and dell also gave that or higher.

Keyboard -- 3/5 because of bulid quality and no backlit.

Build quality -- 3/5 Full plastic no metal at all😔

Desgin -- 4/5 Design is good but touchpad and keyboard are feel like cheap plastic.

Noise -- 1/5 because of HDD😡",4
Excellent product friends I will recommend performance awasome i3 11th generation my usage only coding and program useful for students also I will recommended,5
"Its take 15-16 minute in first time boot b'cos of hdd
After that booking time is 20-25 sec
Designe good
Battery good
Performance good
You will go for it",4
"I took my leap of faith and bought this one as there were not many reviews and the ones that were there were not very encouraging. I purchased it primarily for my kids online studies and so far so good. After HDFC card discount and old laptop exchange I got it for INR 31K which I believe is a fair deal. I am writing the review after a weeks of usage to share the first hand feedback.

All the negative reviews here are probably not without a reason. There is certainly slight lag. At times the CPU utilization goes up to 100% on itself and then come down. It takes its sweet time (for the first time whenever anything new is tried on it) however thereafter the response time is better. Once set, the routine jobs it does well.

Looks, Display, Weight, Camera, Style are all premium. Battery backup is again decent. It took around 20-30 minutes to set it up for the first time. There are videos on Youtube which can guide the novices on how to set it up. MS office was pre-activated for me and standard warranty is applicable for 13 months. No heating issues in my case.

Around 7.8GB is the RAM available for CPU usage and 970GB space is available on the HDD.

Again, Review your requirements and your budget before taking a final call. Happy to answer if there are any questions.

Hope it helps. Good luck!

"Just add ssd for windows C and boot up and enjoy ! Awesome device. After booting for first time, I updated windows, uninstalled useless pre-installed apps . Now it works so smooth !",5
Excellent.. starting we have to wait 15minutes to start . after start .it will be nice..,5
"The product is awesome.
Don't believe in the myth that due to the absence of SSD the system will be very much slower.
Only it takes time in the booting for the first time. Once it's setup then no problem at all.
Don't waste extra 5000K for SSD if you are not a gamer.",5
Wow super product ...worthful.low price,5
Superb thank u Flipkart I like this product very much,5
Now All Things Are Perfect work... Delivery is On Time And Behaviour of Delivery Boy Is Also Good.,5
"I'm using this for past 1 week without any issues. Overall product is good with smooth performance, good resolution, pre-installed MS products etc. Could have been better with backlit keyboard, finger sensor & camera cover option which is available in 15"" inch variant.",4
Super awesome laptop....runs smoothly ...valorant runs on it like fluid...just amazing,5
"Light weight,smooth to work , processing is better",5
"It says Full HD screen and they delivered with a HD Ready screen.

My mistake is that I didn't search for the model no and check on hp website.",1
"Worst ever product i got it... They mentioned processer is 4.2GHz in specification and when it came it was 2.42GHz ....and when replaced that same product came with 4.2GHz.
And now when i am calling to return it no one is receiving call..... Even with app also i am not able to place return order it says to contact us and which again does not get connected... Really frustrated with such service",1
"Truly disappointed with HP . Its a corei5 11th gen laptop, which heats up like old amd laptops. I urge everyone not to go for this one. HP need to think and change this model. Thanks to Amazon for accepting the return",1
"Very good product. After switching on it gets ready to use in less than 10 seconds and gets switch off in less than 5 seconds. Using multiple tabs at a time does not make anything slow. Heavy word, excel and PowerPoint usage is also smooth. Product is recent launch in 2021 and very useful in working from home or for online tasks. Best value for money. I exchanged by Dell laptop which was i3 and 4gb ram and was very slow. For any decent use the minimum requirement is i5 with 8gb ram and in this product the SSD, turbo boost and graphics card makes it much faster. Full HD resolution gives super picture quality.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Awesome laptop
Good for engineering students.we bought it for my brother's 18th birthday. He is going to go into it so a really good hit. light weight. smooth like butter.*army refrence* go for it",4
"There has been an incorrect description of this product. The display quality of the is really bad and strain to eyes, one can not use for a longer time. Please be watchful before buying it. We did not have the IPS version and opted for the Full HD version but it is nowhere near that. If you are going to use a Laptop screen for primary display purposes, this laptop is not ideal. The description should be fixed ASAP.",3
The product is truly awesome. One cons that i observed is during the video calls the laptop heats up higher than usual.,5
"First of all this is a very very good looking laptop. The size is absolutely perfect and the screen is amazing, not anti glare though. The processor does its job without any hiccups and battery gives back-up for 5-5.30 hours. SSD with NVMe interface is very fast and I did not experience any heating issue as such. It comes with MS Windows 10 Home and MS Office with lifetime validity. Overall this will be a good choice for anyone who is looking for a lightweight and compact laptop with amazing performance for work or study purpose.",5
"Bought this laptop for my kids to attend online classes. Fast booting in 10 secs and smooth operation. Compared other brand models in the same range, less features. No fingerprint reader ord keyboard back-light. Sturdy look, Good display.",4
"Received this laptop on Friday, n on next day Saturday it didn't boot up, hard disk error. Had to call HP service center, now I'm waiting for the technician to come n seal the device n get some letter before I could approach Amazon for replacement..",1

 I am very disappointed with this laptop because. I got the replaced product. But it is very very worst product ever. Please don't buy this laptop. Heating Issues + charger Heating Issue + laptop hang issue. This laptop battery is working only upto 3 hrs. Worst class Laptop😡😡",1
"It’s been 3days device is quite fast and it’s a great experience till now let’s see how it goes further.
Recommended from my side if someone is confused don’t be go for it.👍🏻",5
Good quality lappy for students as well as for gamers. I5 processor brings in the speed which makes it a worth buy.,5
Battery life extremely poor. Keys are depressed at left and right side. Heats up quickky. Have bought laptops from amazon before but this has been a bad experience.,1
"Performance is good, lightweight and fast, but even if there is no program is running, it starts to overheat. Battery backup is very less (3-4 hours only) about half the time boasted on the website. I do not recommend this",2
"Light weight, easy to carry, anti glare screen, and intel iris xe graphics, overall very good product. Worth of money.",5
"HP laptops are always awesome, go for it without any hesitation. 👍👍",5
Poor battery performance,2
"This is a very good laptop,it's light weight,doesn't hang in betwee like our older laptop,it's good for gaming and fortnite works just fine on it.I would highly recommend this laptop,and its value for money.",4
Products is awesome. All the things of this laptop is good. Nice battery backup around 7hrs.,5
"Good product. Only drawback I learnt is it can't be extended for Warranty which is disappointing.
Seller shud be more clear while selling. As customers we expect transparency.",4
"Got the laptop with a clearly visible dent on its body
Not so satisfied with that",3
Good,5
"1st point don't by on exchange any product coz, while collecting they come up with new rule and 2nd don't buy HP laptop they service sucks",1
Speed and processing is so fast . I bought what i need . Perfect product for office and home,5
"Amazing build, quality, sleek design, easy to use",5
The best thing I observed in this laptop is its screen quality is the best and I really appreciate to HP,5
Nice laptop for personal use,4
"Very Light weight and performance and speed is good but ,experienced heat while using.",5
Best and worth it,5
Screen is 14 inches,3
Good with light weight,4
Everything is fine..but camera quality is not good,4
Like,5
Good product,5
,5
"Please note, the screen size is 14"". Its a good lightweight laptop with descent performance. Not or gaming. MS Office is free, which is good.",4
The product headline is confusing. I got it as a office laptop. If you see the product headline it says FHD(10180p) but what you get is only HD(720p). This drastically reduces the display quality and text appears to be blurry and pixelated. Please specify correct product details.,1
"Super it is nice iam using from 6 moths there is no any problem from with this laptop
I love with this",5
"Good laptop. People who r complaining they got hd version, make sure you order fhd version. Very light weight. Cute looking",5
Very slow and not good 8gb ram according speed very slow and hang bad laptop plz don't money west,4
Really hate the product. Its wastage of money. Its taking too long to start and its making a wierd noice in the background its too heavy and large and is not handy at ol.worst part is that they are not even ready to refund nor replace. Really pissed off,1
The Product Worth it,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Please don't buy this laptop. The screen keeps freezing. I bought this laptop for my daughters online classes but every 15-20mins whether using zoom or Microsoft teams it keeps freezing. Processor is too slow. Was coming back to HP brand after a gap of 10 years but this has reminded me that why I stayed away all these years. Please do not waste your hard earned money on this.",1
This is a review after more than 6 months of usage.I had an azuz laptop. But since I had many problems while operating it I ordered this one. At first it was good But now it keeps switching off at times. At first had 9 hR battery now only 3-4 hrs. Not happy with the purchase.,2
"After using it from last 40 days, I have observed all it's aspects deeply.

At this prize laptop looks premium. Amazing Design, I got latop with in 3 days today. It has Magnificent Processor... Amazing Display.. Easy to use. Battery is also Good. Smooth Touch pad. Overall a genniune Product for Educational and Business Purpose. Go for It.
If you want to get more advanced product just add some SDD....

Minnor Issue:- It's making some noise while running over internet.",4
"I purchased GR0011AU (1TB HDD no SSD, Ryzen 3 3250). Economical Laptop with decent performance. Battery backup around 5.5 to 6 hrs on streaming video via wifi and general browsing. I avoided purchasing extended warranty online. Instead buy from the HP helpline (number attached in photo). Registration and setup of MS Office Home and Student 2019 is tricky as the laptop has Office 365 installed as default. This (365) has to be uninstalled and the Office H&S 2019 image (3.5GB) has to be downloaded and set up. I am doing it all through the HP helpline and they are helpful.. Overall decent/good laptop for my basic requirements and very good customer support, atleast during setup.",4
"Pros:
Display quality.
Light weight.
Decent sound.
Good performance as per it's hardware.

Cons:
One main thing is it's GPU is shared memory not dedicated. Almost 2GB ram will allocated for Graphics. Felt like 4gb even it's 5.9gb usable.
Design flaws are there, rough edges like unfinished .
Heat vent is placed at bottom, so we have to keep alway on flat surface.
Very thin bezel around display.",3
Looks good 🙂😊,4
"Firstly for the correct information of all potential buyers - I have had a good experience of HP laptops. Secondly i had budget constraints (below 35k)... so I had to go for one with only HDD, not SSD. I would have loved hybrid types as those work excellent.
Thus I opted for this laptop with no SSD, only 1TB HDD, however i preferred 8GB RAM...
it has been 3 days and we have been using it for Zoom long meetings..and general surfing (no multimedia use yet). So far there are no visible issues. The fan sometimes gives out a slight burning smell and I assume it is because the circuitry is new... I shall monitor for more days and give another review on this.
The laptop's nice feature is the CORTANA support by which windows got configured smoothly, with little intervention. it did take lot of time to boot initially, but now boots up fine....
Havent faced any sound or heat issues yet.
Screen output quality could have been better..... to get the optimum brightness you have to raise the brightness to almost the limit.
Sound output is not that great.....
so far so good. will post again after a month of use.",4
Products is good....i am satisfied.....but not very first...it takes time to open a exel file.... Battery brkup good.....other facility also satisfying.,4
laptop is hanging if we install more products,1
A used product that was damaged was delivered. Absolutely appalled by this service & I can't believe a new product paid for in full was delivered in this condition,1
"I bought recently and was not disappointed with the product at all. However if you are looking for a product that supports accounting software, etc, please buy a bit higher range. Laptop is more or less fast with good screen quality. Video conferencing is easy on this laptop. Graphic card is high so gaming is good too. Overall satisfied and good for students👍🏻😊",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 After seeing the reviews I was confused. But I decided to go for this and it got delivered within 1 day. I really liked this product. Looks premium, built quality is also good and also fast. It's a good laptop under 36k. As of now, this is my review and if there will be any issue, will let you know.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Too slow and takes time to get start. If you are working on more than 2 virtual box machine then you will have worst experience ever. Machine gets hanged and restart several time.
Not worth it & it seems mentioned configuration is not up to the mark with respect to its performance...
Not Happy at all",1
"I purchased this machine for my college assignments and all
If you also need it for not so heavy tasks you must go for it",5
"I bought this laptop with 8GB of ram and 1TB HDD, and AMD ryzen 3 3250U with integrated graphics.
This laptop is good for taking online classes and web surfing.

Most of them are afraid of buying AMD processor's but you would not find any heating issues, infact AMD gives more performance with low temperature.

If you are a person who is for taking online classes and conference, then you can definately go for it.
If need for more performance, then add some 250GB SSD.
I will update my review after 6 months.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Looks good
But processing is very slow from day 1st.
8gb ram and AMD processor with ryzon 3 is not compatible with this product. Itna to samsung bhi nahi hang karta. Agar ese hi laptop aane lage to ...apple ke alawa koi or laptop lega hi nahi koi...not recommend at all. Buy now and cry all the time after owing it.",1
Don't buy it seriously telling you very bad laptop you all regret after buying it not mentioned specs given hang everytime . Don't buy it,1
"Packing, look wise, is fine. It's been 3 days I am using this device. No additional application installed. But what we are gonna do with the look, performance wise it questions me is this device holds 8GB RAM or 2GB. For name sake they have said 8GB, but the time it takes to refresh n open n response its lagging... Those 4 stars is only for look n packing n build quality.",4
"I bought this laptop only for basic office functions like word editing and simple excel works. I kept my expectations low while buying it. But still this laptop didn't even reach those basic expectations. Its taking 4 mins to boot :( and work on updates forever whenever you try to shutdown or restart. I bought this relying on HP brand name and regretting now. Don't know the problem is due to processor or OS or hardware config, but whatever it is, the final result is worst.",2
Very poor performance speed . It will take more time for booting too. While click on browser or any apps it's respond very slowly.,2
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.

"Product is low quality.within 3 days use the monitor gone blank. Also when use with internet it makes a lot of noise.
Booting is pathetic and takes minimum 4 to 5 minutes.
After paying so much amount and getting such quality is really bad.
Would never recommend any of my friends or relatives to buy this anymore.
Now waiting for hp to provide resolution.
It is 4 th day but till date no update from HP.
Amazon pls do not sell such low quality product at your site. People will ignore Amazone in future.
Not sure if I get some call back or any replacement.",1

Total waste of Money,1
"Worth money.
I have been using this from 2 days its fantastic.
I mainly used this for online classes and gaming. Good performance.
Only one disadvantage: overheating",5
"Excellent product for Students. It has it all built in. Be it Windows 10, MS office life time, HD camera, High resolution display, 8 Gb ram, 1Tb HDD, High quality stereo speakers with good volume.

"The battery life in working condition as per Amazon site will be 8hrs. But sad part is after full charge 25% battery drained within 30 mnts of using mail only .
Pathetic experience and complete wastage of money as the laptop I only 4 days old",1
"Very slow and hangs every now and then. The issue persisted even after the replacement. So, it's a problem with the product. Please go for SSD laptop and stay away from HDD if possible! Very slow and often hangs even while using very basic applications.",2
"This is my second day and the Laptop already is laggy and choppy. I have not filled the storage and neither have I installed any games and yet it already Lags. Even A lower Specs variant will perform better than this, Bad Choice",1
Fake details are given.and laptop is very slow. It's take lots of time while booting.,1

5.Good sound quality

Cons:
1.Keyboard back light is not available
2.Screen brightness is quite low",4
"This laptop comes with a good design for this price. Laptop is bit slow, and sometimes keeps hanging. If you avoid high-end applications then it's good. The best thing is comes with MS Office and Win 10 License.

You can goahead with this price and this features if not a high end user.",4
Its a wonderful system for daily usage. Not meant for heavy gaming. But handles daily usage without any lags. I would say add extra money and go for the one with an SSD as well. Might bump up the speed even more as this only has an HDD.,5
"This Laptop is very fast with Best screen quality and Useful for online classes.
This is one best laptops at this price.
Go for it....",5

"Laptop doesn't have Lights in Keyboard, So you can't work in Night if you don't wants to switch on the Light",3
Been using it for a month and at this price its worth every penny.,5
Everthing is nice but proccessing system is too weak and whenever i start my PC it may take much minutes for opening it.. May be the amazon report to hp to resolve our problem with HP 15 (2021)....,2

"Totally in awe of this laptop .
It’s a wonderful deal for the price. Initially being reluctant to try Ryzen but I am amazed at the speed, one may not notice the difference between intel and Ryzen . The screen calibration is upto the mark. Sound is crisp and clear. It comes with 8GB RAM and 1tb memory which makes the machine way smoother and faster.
Battery life is good for the average usage. Like WFH and online classes. May not recommend for heavy gaming.
However the only flip side is the starting time, it takes a while to start completely .
Apart from this what I totally adore is the premium look it gives at an affordable price. Doesn’t look plasticky at all .
It is a good buy, totally worth it!",5
64 Bits Windows 10 64 Bits ? Or not under this laptop. What is processer type of this HP laptop.?,3

 We bought this laptop a week ago and use It after 3 days after delivery. Waste of money. Never seen so much slow processor like this. 8GB Ram & 1TB HDD took 10 min to shut down. AmD Ryzen processor 3 a big NO.",1
"Received defective product initially.
Battery was not changing.

But replaced immediately next day by Amazon.

Will review again after checking the performance after a week.",3
Don't buy this product. This is waste of money. Wherever you click it hangs. It was unexpected from a hp product. Their customer service is even worse. There are contact numbers given on the laptop but the call does not go through on any of the numbers. Ridiculous. My 36K goes to vain.,1
Processor very slow even though no apps or outside software loaded. There is a lag even though it's 8 gb ram and 1 TB.,5
It's freezing very frequently and been blank since an hour... i don't know what my might be the reason.. but it is disturbing my work and making me worried so much.. hp support team please help!!!,3
Heating too much ...when you open then only it starts heating... otherwise ok low weight...easy to carry.. battery also charging out in low time,3

Overally it is a perfect worth. Go for it 👌",5
Amazon team did not help me to change this product - It is very slow and hangs everytime . When i called Amazon call centre they did not help me at all.,1
Value for money...but the laptop performance is slow sometimes......U can go for it!! If u r searcjing for bqsic needs rather than gaming and editing,3
"Worst performace and lagging a lot, why the hell the screen is not standard, it is very delicate.

Price is high. So in these laptop decrease the price then it is good. It's price is main factor. And all is well,1
Very good product at 35k.,5
Delivered a damaged product,1
overall Good performance for IT professionals.,5
Very slow .. and when once it get hanged than you have to switch off and that start... Very much problem creating pappu... middle of the important meeting... It will betrayed you..,1
Lol. What a big discount of 50 Rs I saved and bought a mercedes and I'll. But more and buy a bungalow,5
"First, the laptop is a large one with numeric keypad. Resolution is great at 1366x768 (I have a mac with retina, and I felt this to be good enough). Bought it as a second one and my kid's online classes. No eye strain. Build is average, but nothing that worries me. Weight-wise light.

This is not for professional use. You cannot expect a ~20K laptop run multiple VMs with heavy coding and testing, or video editing. 4GB RAM with Celeron gets overwhelmed! The SSD does make things bit fast and no whirring sounds of HDDs. Keys are clunky enough to type. Looks are good, if not great. Note that Windows has never been an OS that is optimized for hardware (and they come in huge variations), so performance can go up and down based on context. It showed ~200GB out of 237GB when I set it up the first time. Charge indicator led is at left side (took bit time to figure it out).

Great value for money. For everyday use of running a few errands (read, mails and browsing), office editing, low end gaming, video classes and chats, and some lightweight programming.",5
"I got it for a little over 18.5k₹. Yes the processor is tier 2, the ssd is low in capacity, but so is the price! Does the job well, able to play YouTube videos, able to modify Microsoft office documents, able to surf the net, able to multitask with above use cases. Happy with it so far.",5
"Nice...after 10 days using I can say this laptop gave me 6 hours backup continue on YouTube...and no problem face still....Awesome laptop in this price or student and multitasking..
Internet speed also good",4
"Performance at this range is good, battery backup is upto 4.5hours. its a basic and light machine which can be easily carried around. The penntium core should have been in the latest ""i"" series.",4
"very slow, hang problem, updating of window take 2 hours to open",1
Very bad product. Pls do not buy. With in a day power button not working. Screen is not switching on. No button is responding only fan is working. Its a Chinese product. I have no idea that Asus is making such a bad quality product. Also no return only replacement. My money is hold with them. Pathetic product.,1
"I like everything about it. Good 15.5 in. visual screen, decent sound, excellent keyboard, (no cap lock indicator unfortunately). There was just one ambiguous review when I bought it. To buy a celeron processor 2nd rung from the bottom? Glad i did. The Celeron does its job perfectly in tandem with the SSD. Gamers should be aware this is not for them.",4
"Hello guys this product is good not best for all because it is not fit for a video editor or programmer if you are YouTuber then you find another product you need to pay some extra money

this is only for those who are using chrome or watching movies, it is not lag even when I open 10 chrome and each chrome browser open almost 20 tabs even then it works fine no issue I found there

its battery is good, it gives me 4 to 5 hours only when I am using a web browser

and its full charge in 1.30hrs ( poor )

Overall it is good because it is a very low price laptop under 20,000

Its display is good My personal experience is it is very good under this price range

Its keyboard is awesome and its music is good

My overall rating is according to its price range

4.5 out of 5

Thank you for reading my review.",4
"No LAN port which means works only on WIFI.

At times when wifi is not stable you connect internet with LAN cable but unfortunately the company has not reserched properly that there are still certain places where wifi is not available so, how would one connect?

Furthermore, replacement is not helpful.

No where it's mentioned that there is no LAN port which is certainly hiding the feature.",1
"Good laptop for the starters as it provides one a basic job without the expections of high end functionalities.
The cost covers lots of pros with the below mentioned con
Screen lacks certain hd touch however considering the price in mind I would refuse to complain about the same.",4
"Had exchanged my old laptop for this one and I must say am more then satisfied. Does the job of word processing, YouTube watching on 4k with a excellent sound quality and loud too along with multi tasking. Shift all the games and music/documents to the sd card and hard disk is free and fast. Boots up within 10 seconds . Games launched until 2016 can be handled effortlessly and that says a lot about the budget laptop. Build quality is just ok but like I said total budget laptop. Asus is offering hard disk at discount price of 1999 and extension of warranty for an year for Rs 99 ! Great deal. Total value for money.",5
"This laptop is only for light usage and don't install heavy softwares. Handle this laptop with care because it is very fragile and light weight.

Screen clarity is poor but I don't want because of price for which I purchased after replacing my 10 year old laptop.

Battery seems to be okay but check it performs after 3~4 months.

No heating issue reported for basic usage.

Overall it is value for money for me.",4
"Configuration of the product is very good for basic work.
Light weight, nice look enough for basic work.
But I received defective piece as shown in pics the display is not fitted perfectly. There is a gap in display.
When I raised for replacement, the product is not available to replace.
So Amazon should look in to this matter.",1
"IN THIS PRICE YOU CAN'T GET A BETTER LAPTOP. IT IS A BASIC LAPTOP FOR DAILY USE AND WITH SOME COMMON SENSE YOU CAN GET THE BEST OUT OF IT.

I HAVE UNINSTALLED ALL THE SOFTWARE (ANTI VIRUS- AS WINDOWS SECURITY IS ALREADY INSTALLED), OFICE 365 -ONE MONTH TRIAL ETC, AND IAM WORKING ON EDGE SO DID NOT INSTALL CHROME.....
NOW WITH SSD AND USING ONLY THE REQUIRED SOFTWARE,MY LAPTOP IS AS FAST AS i5 PROCESSOR WITH 8 GB RAM.
IAM HAPPY WITH IT",5
Poor performance and avoid any one who wants to buy this product .they don't have cancellation option once bought only replacement .!!!!! Alert,1
"The product is awesome in this price range. I purchased this a week before and am liking it so much, booting is so quick due to ssd. There may be issue with space but asus site is offering 1TB HDD just at 1900 and one year warranty extension just at 99,this is exclusively for Asus laptop.

This laptop is good for normal usage, browsing, wiring in ms word etc.",4
Seller should not sale this LAPTOP as its hardware configuration is very Old and software which are supposed to run on this Laptop becomes very slow i.e. MS Teams and updates of Windows 10 SUCKS so I request to seller please either stop to sell this LAPTOP or either increase RAM or provide some compatible hardware meeting with demand of current scenario.,1
"It is a perfect value for money Laptop from ASUS. it is just for daily users not for gamer or edition person. I have purchased this for office work and my daughter online classes.

It is really working fine. Batter life around 4-5 hrs off moderate use. Sound is good. Weight is balanced. It comes with Finger print sensor, which is fats and accurate.

Don't worry about basic processor Like Intel celeron. SSD did all. Fast and smooth. U can shutdown and ON your laptop within 10 second. Restart time arround 7 second.

Go for it to work moderate on daily basis.

ASUS made it possible with the attractive purchase range.",5
"I am using this laptop for a week and feeling so much thankful to my choice of purchase as it is working accordingly my expectations .
This laptop was manufactured in Apr 21 and have great features like fingerprints 256GB ssd which gives flawless speed and having fast charging capacity although it is not full HD but still not much difference in picture quality comparatively.
The most favored thing in this laptop is that is of only 21350 INR by HDFC credit EMI transaction .
As I bought it for study purpose, it is one of the best laptop in this price range.",5
"Got it for 9500rs in exchange my 9yr old dell core i3 3rd gen laptop delivers better value qt this price than Dell HP Lenovo

Very good laptop for basic use, Aug 2020 manufactured although Celeron processes is 4yr old CPU model

i bought for 2 reason SSD and genuine windows 10 OS and it worked way better than my Dell Core i3 6GB Ram laptop because of SSD. boots in 15sec.

you cannot use or keep too apps open i use it for browsing and MS office although didn't see any lag but it hase 2 cores max speed of 1.1GHZ you cannot use CPU intensity apps like video editing or photoshop etc. go for pantium gold if you can but difficult to find any model at this price range with SSD.

Scree quality is very good Camera could have been better, old CMOS PC camera but can do zoom meeting without any issues.",5
"Pros
1. Sufficient for online classes
2. Ssd given 256gb while usable is 203gb, it has extra slots too to increase the storage afterwards.
3. Due to presence of ssd boot time is very fast.
4. 15 second boot time
5. MS office runs smooth
6. Youtube almost lag free
7. Quite big and light weight
8. Good battery management, got 6 hrs of back to back video call

Cons
1. You won't be getting a fast processor on which you can play games

Overall at this price I can't ask for more
Go for it bros",5
"I was in doubt that is it will be support Tally & Busy Accounting Softwares.
But after buy it all things are going good.
Both Softwares are working without any issues.
Nice Product 👍👍",5
"What does one want for 18.5k -20k? A basic laptop which this laptop is. All people complaining about being slow etc did you known what you were buying? Big screen with a full keyboard layout with Num keys and basic configuration good enough for emails, MS office and web activities. Yes there are some drawback, slow, cheap plastic, no caps n num led, No Lan etc but you are buying a cheap laptop and that is what you are getting. I would say good value for money.",5
Ordered it few months ago. No issues found so far besides the speed which is expected out of this model. Battery comes up to 3+ hours. Light weight. Not super slim but still slim enough. Nice feel. Mouse pad is a bit insensitive at times but manageable.,4
"I was surprised to see that there is no LAN port. Yes it is true. Moreover, it doesn't even have USB type C port which sometimes let you have a LAN port. So, big disappointment there.
Performance wise it is at par giving the processor it has.",2
"I have ordered new original product not renewed product, but they are delivered renewed product.

Very very bad product over all in the all the aspects. Please delete this item in Amazon. People are not like all rich people in INDIA.

"Very bad experience with this product as within 2 months got an issue and not able not switch on this laptop. Totally very bad experience here as never got such a worst product like this so better do not take a risk here & buy this product. Amazon please don't promote such bad products in your online platform and also please try to make some policy with brands for arranging a replacement in such situations. As per your suggestion, we have given this laptop product to Lenovo service center and they are saying motherboard damaged. So within this short time how it damaged so it seems like they are trying to sell second-hand goods or very cheap product in this online platform. And saying cannot replace the laptop but normally 1 year warranty means it should be replaced.Right.Amazon must have some quality and testing standards and checking before delivering to customers and should interfere to solve issue for buyers.If that service not getting then what is Amazon's credibility here.",1

Does not have a built in wireless router. Got fooled by their marketing pitch. Pathetic. Need to buy separately. Disappointed. They are selling laptops without router. Real desperate sellers indeed.

"Its a Good Value for money Laptop.

Battery life 4.5 out of 5 stars
is Highest in 10th Generation Intel. (4 - 6 hours of Office work)

Speed - 2.8 out of 5 stars
it's OK for office work like Internet surfing, word excel PowerPoint zoom.

Weight - 3 out of 5 stars.
It has decent weight. Lighter than dell and heavier than atom book.

I am a technician since 1998 and know much about technology in depth.

Buy this if your work is simple.
Buy if you want highest battery life.
Buy to save money because this is the cheapest cpu out there between 21500 - 28000 range. Depends on market state and tax.

* Don't buy for gaming.
* Don't Buy for upgrading if you don't have experience, because this laptop needs professional hands to open and upgrade.
* Don't Buy if you want to use more than 5 applications and software in single time.

This laptop as per the budget is slower than the 32000 - 38000 range i3/amd. But remember this is a 10th Generation with future possibilities to upgrade to 16gb ram and SSD. After upgrading this will have 600% faster speeds and 30% improved battery and the weight will also be reduced .

Buy this and you can upgrade with faster RaM and ssd to make it blazing fast. This makes it essentially future proofing with upgrades.

*Let me tell you in Simple words. The speed is EQUAL to Intel 4th Gen i5 processor.*",4
This is a good entry-level laptop for the price. Highly recommended for students - study for home and for light office work. Can be used as a good entertainment device as well.,5
Pathetic...it's very slow n work stucked.. it was my mistake..my kid not able to do class smoothly...if I could exchange with other model//ssd it would be greatful,1
"Package is already opened and also Performance bad ,Ms office already installed but could not working it's still updating and then error message...",1
"I have got new laptop, but too much slowness is there, could you please any one assist that how to speed up",2
"Hi , i have not received warranty card with my laptop .. please check
And revert as i need it",4
Samne Se Dekhne per hi image saaf Dikhai deta hai HP isase aur achcha kar sakta tha Hame yah bilkul Achcha Nahi hai very bad experience,2
"Very slim ,light weight easily carry in traveling.
Good battery time.....Min 5hrs
For office use best one.",4
"I bought this exchanging my Acer Aspire V5 intel i3 laptop since Pentium Gold processor is almost same, except for lesser L3 cache memory (3 MB to 2 MB).

There is absolutely no heating or any other issues due to SSD. This fits my requirement of day to day browsing, reading, videos etc. Very good laptop for this price.

Good price for old laptop & card discount from ICICI due to Diwali sale.",5
"initial impression is excellent...light weight,thin,travel friendly.Super fast booting,due to ssd. hop this laptop last long.lets see what happen due to corse of time.",5
"I am a Computer Technician, and i have purchased and configured 5 of these. 2 were purchased from Amazon.

Key Points.
1) Initial Setup takes around 40 minutes but after that
2) LAPTOP BOOTS IN LESS THAN 10 SECONDS (5 seconds frankly)
Yes this laptop is Super FAST, because of its m.2 ssd.
3) Clients with 3rd and 4th generation Core i5 laptops with 8 GB Rams couldnt spot the Difference in speeds. You are basically comparing a 45000rs - 65000rs year 2015 Laptops with a 2020, 30000rs. Which is just 2 core 2mb cache. Still is fast.. Thank you m.2
4) Recomended for people who want a Blazing fast laptop for Surfing, working on Excel, word.

This laptop has
1) License Lifetime Original Windows
2) License for 1 year Microsoft Office student edition (word excel one note)
3) has a 250 GB m.2 SSD Storage. (BLAZING FAST)
4) Single Slot 4 GB Ram (If you want to upgrade to 16 GB.. its going to be a Difficult Turn)

Word of Advice.
1) IF you work simultaeously on Multiple Softwares. like 6 - 10 Excel sheets or heavy programmes like Adobe, then you may consider skipping this laptop as the RAM is just 4 gb
2) Only Intel graphics but Old adobe and basic 3d softwares below 2018 works.

Its a Value for Money. I am waiting for Competition like DELL and LENOVO to launch their varients so prices will drop. in 2 years.",4
"Worst service from Amazon and the seller. After buying this laptop I found that it's not suitable for running Android studio and I wanted to return it to get a higher configuration laptop but to my surprise I can't return it, the very next day. I was in the impression that we can return any item on Amazon but that was my biggest mistake and I lost 25k. This laptop is useless for me. Not happy at all.",1
"I am writing this review after using the laptop for one month.
1) The MS office 2019 is original , just activate when you recieve it by login into your microsoft account. If you don't have a microsoft account create it.
2) The laptop boots in just 3 to 4 second. It is very fast on SSD.
3) The shutdown also takes just 3 second, thus you save your valuable time.
4) The processing is also very reasonable and good at this price.
5) It work for about 7 hour in one charge.
6) Autocad 2017 is working fine on it.
7) Overall the performance of the laptop is very good.
One can buy it without any doubts.",5
"It's Amazing! I have never ever thought the SSD can be so fast that the Windows will boot In just 5 seconds!
I Really Loved the HP Laptop with Windows 10 Home + Office 2019 Students already included lifetime.
The only reason for choosing this Laptop over the One with Ryzen A9 APU available on other ecommerce site, & choosing the Pentium 4417U is that, it's faster than the Ryzen.
I really love this lightweight laptop & it's compactness makes it worth.
This laptop is really great if you want windows office and a powerful processor with SSD in this segment of upto ₹28,000 /-",5
This is very bad product from Amazon there is no bill and window is local . it hangs full time I want a complete solution regarding this,1
Sound problem,1
"Purchased this laptop on 29th October 2019.

Writing a review after almost 1 year of usage. To start with this laptop is very quick to start when powered on, hardly takes 5 seconds to start up.

Great for those with basic requirements like daily surfing, Watching movies, MS office, Excel, Powerpoint and basic editing tasks. Due to SSD it works like charm.

Pros
- SSD makes it pretty fast with 5-7 seconds boot and start time. (I checked higher end models in shops but could not find one that starts as quickly this)
- Light weight, this is pretty light and easy to carry, my earlier samsung laptop used to weigh almost 2 kgs and this slim trim piece comes as a delight to me in terms of weight.
- Great battery life, haven't found any problems with battery life till now. It works 6-8 hours on a single charge easily. For me it is on almost for the entire day and it still works great.
- Great volume, I am yet to see a laptop with so crystal clear sound. Most laptops have very low volume.
- Got windows 10 and MS office students version license with it which is great add-on at this price point. (many higher priced laptops also don't provide this).

Cons
- Well almost none for me considering my requirements but you can find difficulties with viewing angles and screen resolution while watching movies, but I have no complains for it at this price point.

Conclusion
A great value for money laptop at this price point, After one year I can say that I am pretty happy with the purchase.",5
One of the worst company and laptop available on Amazon...laptop is not working after 6 month use..and worst part is hp customer support they will first waste ur 4-5 days by just doing similar troubleshooting then send some moron technician again this cycle will go on but the problem of laptop will never be resolved...so never buy this laptop,1
Microsoft not working properly. Is it a defective piece,1
Price wise it is a good buy. Major drawback is outer body build quality as the body is not metallic and feels more like card board type. Also battery cannot be removed from outside. It is made in China.,1
"Delivered one day earlier. Windows 10 and MS office Home & Student activated easily.
USB ports are very tightly fitting. Speakers quality just good. Battery approx 5 hours.

Reviewed after one day of use.",5
"Writing this review after 6 months use. Got it for my daughters online classes. No problem till now. Start and shut down in 2 sec.. pretty fast.
Pls go for it if you want basic laptop for regular use and browsing.
Preinstalled Microsoft Office is a plus.
Only con is Camera is very bad but its ok for me coz i don't use it.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 This is a very bad laptop. Do not take it. It hangs and stops running. I have been compelled on amazon many times but they have taken it so far",1
Don't buy this product.. Return policy is not available.,1
This is very very low class product. not working perfectly. hanging in the middle of the programme. customer care is not responding. i made big mistake for buying this product.,1
Its slow as hell and also only after using for 10 days the alphabet markings are rubbing off and disappearing from the keys on keyboard. A very sub standard product.,1
"Cant believe it's a HP Laptop. I don't think people should consider buying Laptop from Amazon.

Amazon team don't take any accountability post the Product is sold. They sell through Partners and possibly fake products. The HP laptop INR >25K didnot last even for 3 months.

Few pointers,
- The Laptop didnot have a Serial Number (there is NO sticker label pasted on the body of the Laptop).
- Thereafter I called up Amazon and raised this issue ... at first they did not acknowledge the problem. Finally, they accepted. However, NO resolution was provided.
- Performance of the Laptop - the less you talk about it , the better it's. Its pathetically slow and HDD has already crashed. In terms of Config, it's 4GB/1TB HDD however the performance is worse than my 4 early old Laptop.

It was a terrible experience for me. People should reconsider before buying from Amazon.",1
"The processor is so fast , it's really good for office work and watching movies go for it...",5
"Its a good student laptop and you can go for it.
Not for gaming or running too much of multi-tasking. Support mentions it can be upgraded to 8GB RAM , still need to check it out. RAM slot support mentions is 1 but shows 2 on the system properties.
Overall a good laptop for this price and its light weight too.",5
"Excellent laptop. Beats macbook air in every department other than battery life, which is about 7 hours. Reviewed after six months usage",5
"Really a good but not wonderful product, backup is great, charging very fast, windows 10 is licensed and free forever, MS Office is not free. It boots not very fast, we can attent phone calls, sms of phone, photos on phone very easily, need not go and take your phone to attend or make calls or sms. It is not for gaming or movies, though good enough for YouTube etc. Need patience to wait for opening apps like skype, trello, hunter, even note pad opens very slow.",3
Just few days but in love with the product ... its light and i like the large fonts on the keypad ... pre installed windows 10 and its easy to set up .. I m Loving IT ;),5
"I bought this laptop 4 days ago and I found laptop is not worthy for use, even you can not run properly word, excel and othe file ,very very slow it will take time each and every single time, you can't play games, if you install game in laptop it will start hanging immediately unless you have to uninstall the game, you can not add extra ram because they don't have provided extra ram slot, even there is not extra slot to add SDD, there is no fan in laptop for cooling and once you buy this laptop you can not refund your money only replacement with same piece even if you want to return and add extra money to but another you can't. Please I suggest if anybody is willing to buy this laptop plz don't buy you regret it 100% so please don't buy.",2
"If you are looking for a laptop for work from home or office use you should go for it without a second thought. Because of its great battery backup and speed due to SSD. Also it's lightweight and good looking too.
But if you are looking for a laptop which should be both good for Work and Gaming you should consider buying another one, because of its low processor and graphics card. It's not good for gaming. You will get good average gaming laptops with more specifications under 40 - 50K if you are lucky.",4
"I don’t know where to start. I have never expected a laptop manufactured during the last decade to be this slow.

Looking at the spec, I recommended this laptop to my friend as he just wanted a smooth functioning laptop for very basic usage. We got the delivery on time with a good packaging however the very first time we turned on the machine it took forever. I told him since it’s the first boot it might have taken time but updating the windows updates would fix it.

It’s been more than a month now, no sign of any improvement. My 11 year old MacBook works like a charm in comparison with this Pathetic laptop.(I know this very absurd comparison)

We already lost the return window and have no idea how to go about with it.

The worse purchase I’ve ever made on Amazon.

I urge people to go through reviews properly before making a decision which you’d regret.",1
"Reveiw after 10 days :
Worst Don't buy these kind of products
Battery life 1hr
Hanging for every 1 sec
Booting time 10 mnts
Heating = You can cook anything
Finally Worst.. Worst... Worst...

This reveiw is from IT employee (ME) in INFOSYS BPM LMT Banglore..
If you still want to buy... Sure you can...",1
"Pros:-
It is really very light weight
Its very fast also
If you don't require much space go with this it prodiess awesome speed ,
Boot ups in 5 sec ,

Cons:-
You have to compromise with storage
But a external hard drive would work good

No fingerprint of face id ,

Lower processor

, But overall value for money, and its quality is also good ,
(Review after one day of usage)",4
"Worse laptop ever ,sound n video quality is good for zoom class ,but the system always keeping on hanging jad to call sopport ,have no proper response as well ,not able to open 2 windows as it's always been gating hanged so frustrating this laptop is ,please go for dell I have brought a dell 5 years back still working amazingly, unfortunately I had left that at home brought this hp product to do my work .worse experience ever .",1
"It is very fast and light weight laptop. I recommend this, because of value of money. It is really faster than i3 laptops. Good to go...",5
This laptop has stopped working just after using it for two weeks. I do not know if this is a fake product.,1
"The product is slow like a turtle. Shame on the professor. Only good for browsing, that too takes long because of entered words to appear, or to open chrome🙆‍♂️ I can't believe I just lost 25K for this",1
"The Laptop is quite light and very fast, especially when starting the OS. The only con is the storage space when compared to the traditional drives, which again is a part of the specification. Overall a good buy!",5
"Small product and on the laptop body there designing grip
And it's SSD drive is awesome it takes max 3-4 second for startup and max 2 second for shutdown
This is happening coz of ssd drive I suggest u to if u have basic use then go for it",4
"Not saying it's completely waste, i trust hp for laptops from years, as i have 2 already at home. But particularly this model performance is below par considering the specifications, should've gone for Intel processor rather than amd. *lags too much, high end softwares like autocad, sketch, coral draw, photoshop isn't compatible or recommended for this variant, it sucks!

*The only solution for lagging on this model is, you've to insert atleast 240GB SSD for smooth experience which cost around 3500/-",2
this product didnot work properly according to my desires,2
"Don't get carried away by price . Not suitable for graphic designers, anyone into photoshop of visual mediums through computer..graphics are terrible, colors are muddled and dark.
I should have.done better research.
What I do like about it is it's very light weight and airy !",3
Many review is sayings it’s SSD but the description is HDD and I got HDD it takes normally around 10 mins to boot up and very very slow laptop.,1
"Just OK product for daily basic functions like browsing, Spread sheet and Word editing.

Comes with a Windows 10.
Doesn't include MS office.
Good resolution.
Battery backup for 4 hr max (if you are playing music and videos)",3
Value for the money...Best budget lap ever...,5
"Nothing to dislike in this price range, I bought it for content writing and seo article writing. Though Microsoft 365 is in trial version but I simply have a way around it. However I would suggest you guys to use hp and macfee collaborated security. Overall I am loving it let's see how long it sustains.",5
"MS Office was valid for 4 days only, seller has not mentioned complete details. It's cheating. Pls do not buy as it will waste if you purchase MS office of Rs 5K. Instead invest this 5k to buy more advanced version along with MS office access too.",3
"This laptop is best in it's price range :) But DON'T buy this laptop for gaming purpose . It is only good for normal day to day uses like surfing, photo editing, etc.
✅Although Battery backup is awesome. It charges quickly!
✅Display is average *
✅This is not a light weight laptop ^
✅Processing speed is SLOW* also sometimes it hangs too.
✅Allover I am happy with this laptop cause I do normal work (I don't play games 😅 )& I recommend you to buy this if your budget is under 25000₹",3
"Item as described, super fast delivery. Will review the laptop after a few weeks of use.",5
"Review after using it for 2 weeks continuously:

1. The system is a bit slow to start, but after initial start it's fine.
2. Best for office use.
3. No heating issues.
4. Battery lasts upto 8-9 hours for a normal office use.
5. Light weight. Easy to carry.
6. Do not expect to play games like pubg, cod, etc. It will give you a bad gaming experience.

Overall it's a good laptop at this pricing for a normal use.",4
"I brought it in exchange of my old one for my daughter s school. All was pre installed.

Speed is very good. After pressing the switch it's make it ready in know time. Almost 20 days over no operational issus detected.",5
Out of the box and found out that this ones horribly slow. Take way too long to open simple chrome browser. Waste of money,1
discovered a defected software within the first 5hrs of use which the hp guys can't even fix and they won't let you return. Don't buy this product unless you want to donate your cash. The hp team will be brutal when you contact them. Wish i could give them a 0 star rating.,1
"The speed is very slow even to just see the photos and videos.. sole purpose I’ve purchased this laptop is to watch movies and surf stuffs, see photos tu is but it’s even slower for this basic operations .. display screen is extremely shady and glare .. if you’re watching movie just aside then you won’t be able to see the picture",4
Even pentium IV processors worked very fast compared to this processor. The worst laptop i have ever seen. AMD is a garbage. The whole windows 10 freezes after an hour. Remove windows 10 and use linux for gods sake. Seriously!!! 24k is wasted.,1
"Please check before buying...I am not happy with the service of hp.its look like a toy....sorry toys are better then this .....very slow ...I am giving 3 marks out of 10......you can use this laptop only for Facebook,email,movies only......for.other work you need other laptop for office work ......say no to online ....no one can listen you.

Waste of money ......",1

"A nice laptop with all enough features....Recommended to friends,but,unfortunately unavailable now.",5
"The product is little slow, and Microsoft 365 not included. If you want to buy this than you have to also buy the Microsoft office apart from this . I’m using this last three days it is too slow if you have open three or more programs then you have to wait for some minute because it is going hang.",2

"The laptop is good only for doc work and net surfing.
Issue being pentium gold is a weak processor and only good for battery saving.

If you think of anything else like gaming or development using IDE please buy an 8th gen core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 3200u or above laptop.
BTW ryzen 3 laptops are cheaper and perform as good and have better integrated graphics.(so save money and put that in more RAM and ssd)

Also it has only single RAM slot, so you would never be able to run it on dual channel memory .
Please remember dual channel ram + ssd is the key to smooth performance.
Ssd alone will only make startup and shutdown fast but applications benefits from more memory bandwidth.",1
"It's no doubt that this laptop is a great buy. It sells for this cheap price and you are still getting the best of it.
But if you want something even better with the same money for value aspect then definitely go for this Acer laptop over here

JUST SO YOU KNOW ITS A 14inch laptop and it doesn't comes with a DVD drive.

-Build quality-top notch with light weight design.
-Battery life- great, 6hours plus
-Performance-smooth
-Display-good
-Track pad - more than usable
-Lifetime WINDOWS 10
-Permanent MICROSOFT OFFICE ACTIVATION
-SSD drives which makes your system fly
What else do u need...",5
"I have found 2 issues with the HP laptop I bought from Amazon . It’s a 2 week old laptop as per date .

The HP laptop often looses wifi connectivity. I never had issue with wifi on other laptops I used earlier . I had to reconnect to wifi manually and again the connection drops . I have little or no confidence whether the laptop would stay connected to wifi .

The other issue is the print on the keys of the laptop . Print started to fade already . With a bit more laptop usage , the print on the Keys E, R, D,C and V will appear much lighter than the rest of the keys . Overall not very much satisfied with my purchase .",2
Don't buy,2
"At this price point it is a reasonable laptop. SSD make it super fast. Couple of drawbacks to be aware of: Display is only HD. If you are used to Full HD, you will immediately feel the dull display. The Wifi adapter supports only 2.4 GHz. This is very disappointing, since nowadays even a 10K phone has dual channel Wifi. However, this can be easily fixed with a USB wifi dongle.",3
Purchased on 1/10/2019.till today good.no one issue from this laptop.,5
Within 6 months usage the hinges broke from one side. Very poorly made laptop. 4 gb ram is useless for even basic usage. Added 4 gb extra thrn only it works. Power backup is not predictable. It shuts down with just one sign of battery is low...,2

"Issues
1. Google documents crashing
2. When we use 1 to 2 Firefox pages together crashes system
3. Excel and a browser together will crash
4. Critical error screen
5. Screen sharing on call is not working
6. Uber Conference hangs. It opens very late and audio gets cut often
7. Automatic restart
8. Image loading in gmail taking too much time
9. While operating excel, word etc. Screen gets stuck so not able to understand whether it has entered information or not
10. Switching one tab to another is taking time
11. Flimsy touch pad
12. Dim screen

What we did to fix it, but had very little impact
1. Hard disk partition
2. Start up apps disabled
3. Disk fragmented
4. Created recovery disk as we were getting critical error screen
5. Uninstalled anti virus to make system faster

Additional issues
1. Camera is very bad

Overall verdict
You cannot operate this laptop for any purpose. It is a complete waste of money",1
"So I've used it for 2 days . According to me it's a good choice in this price , well i bought it from this seller itself at 26990 , now the price is shown 31000 .still it's great choice because in the Shop's in my town it's priced 35000 .so now performance , it does what it says , lag free smooth operation i tried 4k video which were stuttering in the i3 desktop in my friends house , it worked in the lap like we used to play 720p in my friends i3 desktop , i skipped many times quickly but never shown a bit of lag etc.. it was smooth and responsive . The build quality was also nice and lightweight . The dolby audio was clear as said . The camera was 0.3mp only . Well can do video call but not a clear hd video call. Screen was also very good after the updating of the graphics software (from windows update) . because when we get the settings are tuned in for power , it Last for around 6 hours with movies , software etc.. effortlessly . But i updated the graphics software and tuned to for maximum visual appearance , still it Lasted 4 hours with all sorts of usage including video editing apps , 4k video playback etc... The screen is mat Which is very nice , but in outdoors at noon etc the brightness may feel a bit not enough , but in indoors etc it's clear . It comes preloaded with windows 10 home latest version so windows update won't use much data , it's activated lifetime . It also has office 360 trial ! . and McAfee antivirus trial ! .i already had a key of office 2016 so i installed it amd activated it works smooth . also i had subscription of Kaspersky so switched to it . It has 1tb hdd ,two 3.2 usb port and one 2.0 usb port .one slot for sdcard , slot to add a ssd and a extra ram ,a HDMI port . The package contained laptop ,and charger ,and guarantee slip .the user manual must be downloaded from internet a qr code is provided to download it .i bought the ryzen 3 version . so that's my review in quick glance.i'll update as i remember. If i missed anything .",5

This product is perfect for the purpose it was bought. He is a tutor and during the pandemic he couldn't teach properly as he didn't have sufficient devices. This solved a lot of issues for him. Very happy to see him continuing his classes through online platforms again.

One small thing happened is that within 2-3 months the audio port stopped working yesterday, where one puts in the headphones jack.",5
"This is a VFM laptop. Plastic body and screen vobbles due to plastic hinges much like Avita Pura laptop does.

I have uninstalled all non-required apps, and kids are only using chrome browser to use ""Google classroom"" which is a very simple website and dont require any extra resources.
Still this computer is very very slow and always feels tired.
I have spent 90K on these 3 machines 6 months back, and feel would have opted for something better.

"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 This laptop sucks even for basic use like video watching and ms office (it doesn't come with ms office you have to buy it or download pirated version). If you are on a tight budget, you can buy this and then install a ssd and aditional 4 gb ram stick to make it usable. Heats quite a bit after 30 mins of continuous usage. Integrated graphics reserve around 800 MB of ram due to which only 3.4 GB of ram is usable. So an additional ram stick is must. Dual core processor is on the weaker side, fans get ramped up quite a bit which is annoying.
The only pro i can think of is the screen quality which is decent according to the price(note that brand has cut corners to give full hd panel at this price). If you are a programmer stay away from this machine and build a PC(you can build a great PC at 25k).",2

"Best laptop under 40k. 1TB HDD, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM, Ryzen 3.

"This is a good multipurpose laptop at its price. My requirement is to buy a laptop for my daughter for her studies. She entered 8th class and with the current requirements to attend classes from home, this is going to be the right laptop for her.

On the features:
* Ryzen 3-3250 is equivalent to Core i3 10th gen but with less cost. It is good for general work like attending classes, internet browsing, working with applications like Word, Excel, PPT, browser, video streaming, etc without reduction in speed.
* 256 GB SSD makes the system 10 times faster than a laptop with HDD.
* 1 TB HDD helps you move your files from SSD to HDD when you are no longer working with them.
* 8 GB RAM is sufficient for medium multitasking.
* 15 inches is a good screen size for multitasking and viewing multiple applications side by side.
* Supports dual-band 2 and 5 GHz WiFi.
* Has front camera for video calls.
* Comes with Windows 10 and MS Office 2019.

Activating MS Office 2019 (Thought this will be helpful to write):
* Do this after completing Windows Setup.
* Launch word or excel. Go to Account. Under Product information, log in with the same id which you gave for Window activation. It will then download MS Office 2019 and it will be activated.

Note: Though I purchased this for my daughter, this laptop is also good for teachers, students pursuing MCA for learning programming. You can install Visual Studio, Android Studio, etc, and learn programming.

Have fun and happy learning.",5
"Best laptop..Display in awesome...Build quality is also decent... I don't play games..only bought for office use...of your budget is 40k go for it or maybe spend 2-3k
extra and buy hp15s eq0024au ...i wanted to buy that but was out of stock for long time",5
"This laptop is perfect for home and student use. Don't get blindsided by the negative reviews. The item arrives in sturdy packaging which prevents it from damage during transit. I myself use this laptop for university online meetings. This laptop is not meant for high graphics gaming, low-resolution games are compatible. Rest assured is fine.

Benefits:
- Heat: No heating issue. While charging only the charging adapter gets warm which is quite normal.
- Charging time: Gets charged in 2hr 30mn (0-100). Playback time (normal usage)- 4 hrs.
- Boot time: 10 secs switch-on & switch-off.
- Writing speed: USB 3.0 (output to input) gives 80-120 Mbps writing speed.
- Display: FHD display, Antiglare display lets you stream Netflix, Youtube & many more from any angle of the laptop.
- Sound: Based on a laptop system, the sound is quite good. I hear music at volume 20/100.
- Touchpad: smooth.
- Pre-activated Office 2019.

Note:
- Purchase a Saco silicon keyboard cover (black) as the visibility of the default key prints in daylight are not so efficiently visible.

- As shown in picture, the laptop must be kept above any plain hard surface so that the air circulation keeps running and does not gets heated.

- In many reviews, you will find that the laptop is getting heated, the worst laptop and all. But one must know properly how to use it.

- At first, I was thinking of purchasing the same model only with Ryzen 3 4300U processor. But I changed my decision and stuck to this only. Because as compared to 4300U, in this laptop 3250U one gets 15.6 Screen, RJ-45 Port, 1TB HDD, calculator keyboard.

- Don't confuse yourself with the processors, someone will say quad-core is better than dual-core, and don't purchase this laptop as it is dual-core. But trust me for home and student basic usage, this laptop is more than enough.

- If one plays a game or performs multi-high tasking software, then the laptop runs at high speed which is a bit noisy. But don't worry its normal only.

- DDR4 2400 mghz is sufficient for a student and basic office meetings use.

- Do check the warranty on HP's official website by entering the serial number which is present at the laptop base or product box.

At last, update your warranty to the latest date. Because the laptop warranty automatically starts from the day it got manufactured. You need not panic, just contact HP by email and provide your amazon bill & amazon warranty slip, they will update the same within 48 working hours.",5
"This laptop is overall a really good package, but there is something fishy. It is not Thin and neither is it light enough. The Ryzen processor and Radeon Graphics work seamlessly, but are not for games. Im still not sure if this graphics card is a Vega 6 or Vega 8, due to the serial number. Buy it only if the price falls under 40k or else go for something better!",1
"Very good product in 40k range , if u want to buy for study and office purpose just go for it.
Better build quality , and most important in 40k range no other companies provides IPS pannel display so, its awsome",5
Anti-glare quality is good although there is slight bit lack in screen brightness .....nd off course u can play games except if played in higher setting it get heatup nd fan sound high.....Overall it is worth buying in this price ....,4
"I was satisfied with the overall performance and speed of the laptop. It works well with the WiFI at home and has all the requisite software needed for online classes. The sound is especially clear with headphones. The webcam is quite good and is sufficient for attending meetings and online classes.

However, if you need to know in advance, the laptop does not have a BACKLIT keyboard. It does not appear to be suited for serious gaming purposes.

Thank You Amazon for the superb quality of packaging and prompt delivery.",5
"Repeatedly this Hangs. Processor is very bad. I dont have much applications installed yet it hangs.
Not at all value for money..waste of money
Posting after a month of use",2
"Hi,
Got my product yesterday. So I'll share the initial impressions now.
The laptop is bit heavy than expected. The fit and finish is good. The screen is very good. The camera quality is just OK, but I think that is sufficient for a meeting.
Can't comment on the performance now. I'll update this review after sometime.
Overall I would say if you are looking for a laptop in the 40K range, this is a good choice.",4
I would suggest not to buy this laptop it has 8gb ram but not at all worth. I had installed applications and laptop started hanging I really don’t believe this is hp product. 0 recommendations and honest review,1
Defective peice wifi not working properly,1
"The product is really good for its price.
Pros:
1. IPS display + anti-glare, great for media consumption!
2. Ssd + Hdd, enough storage!
3. Free Ms. Office for lifetime
4. Ryzen 3 is good enough for studying and office work.
5. Type C port
6. Looks extremely elegant.

Cons:
1. No backlit keyboard.
2. The performance would be better if it had Ryzen 5. (But its quite fast because of the ssd)
3. Built Quality could be better. Also, the laptop being 15.6"", is quite heavy compared to 14"" laptops.
4. Laptop cameras and speakers are never great but they get the job done.

The laptop is working as expected. Not a gaming laptop but extremely good for study purpose- online classes, reading books, web browsing. It's amazing for watching movies and web series! The Ssd makes the laptop fast. I am extremely happy with the purchase. :)",5
"Always Online Products are having issues, after spending huge money for laptop we are not getting perfect item , this laptop mic is not working properly ,even creating disturbance to others while online calls , it is hampering online classes and meetings . My Voice not Audible to others .",1
"USB ports complaint. Both the slots Not compatible with C type chargers, one of them compatible with B type. Return window closed! It was just for 5 days.

Amazon options to download invoice, warranty card shows pdf cannot be opened!",3
Price was little bet higher,5
"It is a good laptop, but setimes it got stuck for about 2-3 mins bit that's not a major thing. If you'll disable low power mode. It will work fine because in low power mode it extends the battery and reduces the performance, So, if you do multitasking . First charge it to about 80-90% then disable low power mode, and then use it. Rest, It's a excellent laptop many good features, and the booting is blazing fast.",4
"Good laptop for normal use
Camera average",4
"Value for money, good in look, light weight .
Fast charging, anti glare screen.

"This is my first laptop and I am pretty happy with my purchase. Under 40k budget this is a great option, it's only drawback is it's battery.. It lasts about 3-4 hrs( for continuous use) and take 2hrs to get fully charged..

"I got this laptop for my kid's remote schooing. The laptop hangs with Microsoft Teams video calling. Everytime it hangs need to reboot the system. For all the AMD processor and the bells & whistles of speed, it could not handle a simple Teams video call.
Additionally i found a slight dent on one side.",2
"Excellent laptop under 40k with well known HP brand.
Everything is good in this laptop for me.
Thanks Amazon and Hp.😊",5
"Heavy excel file stucks. To boot it takes 3-4 seconds. While connected to network - the battery drains fast. 1 hour or 1.5 hours max without network 3hours to 4 hours. In zoom, sometimes camera not found.",3
"Teams was hanging a lot on this laptop.
I updated all the drivers, BIOS, and Windows, but still the problem remained.
Amazon scheduled a technician visit, but still the issue persisted.
The problem was, this product didn't have a return policy, it had only replacement policy. So please make sure what kind of policy is Amazon offering before purchasing the item.",2
Nice product for the price any way u dnt get both sdd and hdd for the price.,4
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Happy to buy this product.
Every thing cool for your daily use. Browse, watching movies, business purpose, document preparation etc..",5
The product works fine but the physical memory of 8gb is not completely available as hardware reserve more than 2 gb which cannot be freed. ( Tried using msconfig to remove the memory allocation but looks like no option in BIOS to remove the reservation). So overall memory is just around 6gb. Very disappointed as was expecting 8gb system for the apps I am using. Looks like by design for AMD processor.,3
you can not watch a single movie on full charge battry is very vad,1
Product is awesome... super speed in this range..love the product,5
"Really happy with my purchase

It's a very good option under 40K Some times fan making extra noise. TouchPad switches are not so good .,4

Good specs and hardware quality for the money paid. Quite satisfied with the product.",5
"for a laptop in the range of 40K, this one is quite satisfying. Fast booting due to SSD, eye-satisfying graphics and good processing speed makes this laptop worth the cost.",4
The laptop gets heated during charging and its too much,3
I like it,4
Great package and smooth interface. 256 GB SSD and 1TB normal capacity with 8 GB ram is more than enough for my kid to attend his online class and store his screenshot.,5

"So i have had an hp laptop for about a year it is not the product which is above but i just wanted to warn anyone checking out these products that do not buy an hp laptop . It is horrible!!!!! There are many software and hardware problems and customer service is Horrible , it is honestly the worst customer service ever.At first you might think that it is a defective laptop but turns out it is an avg hp laptop.Do not go for hp.You can even google the quality of the laptops and you'll find out that MANY people have had terrible experiences.Just please do not use hp ever .Don't even think about it.
if i could i would not even give it one star but because i have to inform everyone in need to",1
If you already use i3 8th generation processors then don’t prefer this because it is comparatively very slow (now I am suffering). Other than this every thing is fine good battery backup .,4
When video or audio runs on a laptop in between sound is breaking (Karrr...karrrr sound is coming ) and gives a very bad experience. Not good for a person who continues watching video or audio on Youtube or another medium on a laptop...I won't recommend this laptop.,3

"looking for some more time before judging it but overall it is indeed a good laptop with a great configuration. Booting time is about 5-8 seconds usually and no heating issue till now. Keypad is good as I am writing this review on this laptop itself! Looking forward to a good battery backup and no lagging, Hoping for the best :-)",4
"The 5 star rating is purely for the laptop as i have not purchased it from Amazon. The laptop configuration has all the elements required for great performance. Its been more than 10 days I am using it and it has been fantastic.
also I got it at 37k after cashback so price wise it was a great deal, the price has got increased by 9-10% in last 10 days...",5

Very very Good Life laptop in this range offered by the hp . Nowhere available with such good features on Amazon,5

"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).

Clarifications/issue points:

1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.
2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.
3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.
4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.
5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)
6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.
7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.
8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.

Pros:

1. Configuration is best at this price level.
2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.
3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.
4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.
5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.
6. Display is average and gets the job done.
7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.
8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.
9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.

Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.

I’ll update this review after one month of usage.",4
"Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box.
Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop.
Laptop's over-all performance is nice. Buy it from a HP showroom directly instead buying it from Amazon.",1
"Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right..
Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget.",5
"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it & after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.

Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light & noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.

Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD.

Features: Comes with ""Office Home & Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps & Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full & med bright).

Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.

Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures & Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.

Speakers is unbelievably very loud & clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.

Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out.

I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc & also my overall experience as I keep using more & more.

Update after 2 weeks:
After lot of research & by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself & found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter & it worked.",4
"I bought this a few days ago, and I am glad I decided to make this purchase. This laptop is probably the only laptop in its segment that boasts such a spec heavy configuration without breaking the bank. The HP pavilion is such a compelling buy and boy does it deliver a premium experience throughout.
Having used a Pavilion 15 before, I gravitated towards the Pavilion series predominantly because of the typing experience and the speakers tuned by Bang and Olufsen! They sound mighty impressive for the price! It’s the same experience this time around. The audio is loud and crisp, and typing experience with 2 stage backlit chiclet keys is fantastic! They key travel and feedback is great. This probably is nitpicking, but the only gripe I have is the Power key is placed next to the Delete key. Although, accidentally pressing the power key won't turn off the device or put it to sleep. The 250 Nits IPS panel is crisp and bright for day to day indoor use. The viewing angles are great too with HDR playback support. Although, I would have loved atleast 300 nits plus panel given the price of the device. The chassis seems rigid and built to last! The top cover and the keyboard deck is metal, stays cool to touch as compared to the bottom cover which is plastic. The trackpad is quite large and supports windows gestures. The fingerprint reader is fast and accurate. The laptop remained silent during my entire sessions of document editing and reviewing. However, the fan kicked in during a windows update, and it was loud. The 43Wh cell helps this laptop with a good battery life. The 65-watt barrel pin charger helps in charging the device quickly, and the device can also be charged via PD enabled chargers via the Type-C port. One nifty addition is the HP Quickdrop. It lets users to transfer files back and forth with a companion mobile app. It’s a great addition for me as I can edit photos on Lightroom and quickly share them to my phone to be shared on social media! The i5 11 gen is a beast of a processor and it barely breaks a sweat during photo editing sessions. It can do some light title gaming with the Intel Iris Xe graphics.

Some closing thoughts:
The HP Pavilion with 16Gb RAM and 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 can be ideal machine for folks wanting a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty sticker price. It is like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY without compromising on processing power. It has been a fantastic purchase so far!",5

Nice product. USB type C can be used for charging but didn't work with 30W Oneplus 7T charger. May be work with 65 watt smartphone charger. Backlight Keyboard has only 2 dimming light settings. Apart from these everything is excellent.,5
Laptop is good and Fast but the GHZ mentioned is not correct they say 4.2 ghz but what we receive is only 2.4 Ghz. I cannot put my earphone in this laptop since it is liitle bit small. earphone from jbl and working fine in mobile. overall laptop is good in this price range,4
11 Gen Laptop with 16GB RAM is a dream combination as of now. Good deal,5
"As soon as the warranty period got over, laptop got defected .I complaind to hp care then it came to notice that amazone has not mentioned s.no in the bill for rectification of this error amazone took approx 18 days to correct the bill and for replacement of defective item Amazon is still making fool that your case is under escalation team and continuously giving new target date but not giving resolution. I am totally feeling mentally harrashed",1
"Claiming 4.2 GHz processor, but Delivered item with 2.4 GHz.",2
"I was searching for a laptop from Feb and bought this in Mar and am the first one to buy this from Amazon. The laptop has value for money, fast, long battery life etc. Sometimes it hangs for no reason. I believe it could be hardware issue and not related to Windows. When the laptop is kept on on a bed, the battery area heats up very quickly and hangs. There were no multiple drives. It would have been better if there were two drives ; one for OS and other for storing personal data.

One interesting factor I observed with Amazon is the moment I bought on march1, there was one review appeared with all 5 star though I have not rated the product. Amazon is giving fake ratings to many products like this. Unless there is a photo of video of the product I would recommend the users not to believe the review.
Pros:
Fast bootup
More RAM
SSD
Long battery life
Fast fingerprint reading
Light weight

Cons:
Hangs sometimes for no reason
Less volume
Key board layout is not user friendly
No RJ45
Only one drive",4
"Awesome features in this laptop
Screen is delight, back lit keyboard is awesome, finger print recognition is really good. I cannot imagine I could get all these features at this price. Super fast drive, free office what else you need.... 16 gb ram

I took this laptop thinking that it will have good performance based on its configuration.

But if you are someone who wants to attend online classes or just browse, then you may go for this laptop.",2
Quality of the laptop seems to be more premium and the lightweight of the laptop fits to our hand. I am not a gamer for normal usage it seems best in class. HP had worked very well in this series with good quality speakers and keyboards are nice power. On and off in lightening speed with the ssd but the only disadvantage is the internal webcam which makes me very disappointed . its just a hd camera. For this price range HP should work on the camera section. overall nice product.,4
"The battery is gone in a month's time it was delivered on 5-Apr-201, hardware diagnosis says battery needs to be replaced. Have already faced issues where the keys just froze and had to contact support team.",1
"This laptop from HP has an excellent hardware configuration. A brand new laptop was delivered to me within 1 day of placing the order. The set-up was pretty fast. You can configure the Office 365 1-month trial version (comes with the laptop) or install your own MS-Office copy. Does not come with a carry-bag or any other accessory. Start-up is extremely smooth and fast with Windows Hello Fingerprint Scan and no problems encountered in the last more than 15 days of daily usage. The fingerprint scanner can however only be used for Windows Hello, it cannot be used for entering your password on websites using HP Security Manager App (as confirmed by HP Support Specialist). Other than this, no problems with the hardware configuration.",4

It is light weight, good graphics and configuration.
Cons:
But not worth of the cost. The touch pad is pathetic and very unconfortable to use.
Battery life ok not great. Camera quality not good.

"An Amazing product from HP. Laptop was delivered today as promised by Amazon.

A 16GB RAM, Intel i5-11th Gen processor, with 512 GB SSD with IRIS integrated graphics , FHD display, backlit keyboard...what else we need in a laptop which costs less than 65k cost?
Looks premium.

I searched all the ecommerce portals and even visited the stores, couldn't find a 16GB RAM laptop with in 65k budget.

5stars for HP pavilion 14 laptop and 5 stars for Amazon :)",5
"This is my first laptop and i love it !... It turn on within in fraction of seconds..
Pros :
1) 16 gigs of RAM & i 5 11 gen processor gives the butter smooth experience.
2) Excellent battery life

Cons:
Touch pad should be more precise",4
"Very good laptop, very light weight so can easily care and operate with single hand.

Battery life is okay as of now.

Brightness is also okay not so bright.

Sound disappointed as it’s not that great it’s hardly manageable at this price point.

Overall good laptop.

And yes, type-c port supports charging also so this is something cool 😊",4

 Writing review after a week of using my beautiful slim light weight laptop.
No need to describe much as I found no cons in this laptop functioning nice no issues till now price might be a bit high but overall I found very nice and handy laptop for all students and study purpose and using software applications running smooth.",4
"I am using it for two months, mainly for work from home and for browsing purpose. I have viewed movies also. finger reader is very fast. battery normal. 4-5 hours capacity. sound is loud though I prefer bluetooth speaker for watching movies on laptop. Overall it fulfills my expectations.",4
"Before ordering the Laptop, I prayed to god to send me the perfect laptop without needing to contact the seller or the HP. and Yes, my prayed were answered. The Laptop works as expected - audio, camera, speed (as it has 16 GB RAM). Thanks HP and Amazon.",5
"First, Notebook is Over Heating
Second, Notebook is not opening
I am fully unsatisfied",1
"So far, so good.

Things that could've improved:
Screen quality and brightness
Camera
Keyboard tactile feedback
Fingerprint reader",5
The system heats up a lot during normal usage or even when kept idle. Rest all seems ok as of now. Boots fast and good at multitask. Expected a privacy shutter for web cam at this price. Privacy concerned people pls buy one from amazon.,3
Very good product in this price range . Smooth and light weight. Easy to carry. If any one has the budget he should buy it .,5
"Amazing product, it's slim and build quality is also good!! Just has little heating issues usual than normal
Overall loved it
Sound quality and heating is a draw back",5
"The only thing that i dont like is the heating it produces under the laptop and sometimes it gets heated from top as well i.e area around keyboard.

Other then this i like this laptop. Battery life is around 4-5 hrs minimum if you are continuously working. Design is lit. Its thin and looks cool!",3
"Product is real good in terms of processing speed. Also, I would say it's light weight and sleek. Flawless fingerprint scanner.",5
Awesome laptop along with perfect configuration at this price. However due to its metallic build there might be chances of heating at the right side bottom part so better use laptop stand to stave off heating. Rest all good so go and grab if interested,4
"All good for the budget. The laptop built material is not that good. The upper body is shaking when you work in front cooler, of course not a major issue but shows the quality of material. Laptop is super fast but at times it hangs for a second, say one in 25 times. Absolute peach for students.",5
"Performance is really fast
Battery lasts 6 to 7 hours
Display quality excellent
I just loved backlit keyboard
Light weight
Premium look
Blindly go for it",5
"Perfect Pack. Go for it.
-Charging through type-c only when powered off.
-currently B&O doesn't support headphone",4

Pavillions are the worst laptops please think twice before buying this product I have Pavillion laptop i5 but the performance is really not to the point plus i have graphics card and its not up to point as it seems to be better buy a asus laptop,1
"I bought this laptop from hp store. This is the best budget laptop having 16gb - 3200 RAM. We can also increase the capacity of SSD to 1TB.
One thing I didn't like is 250 nits brightness..mit should have been 300 nits.

- latest 11th gen processor
- 16gb RAM
- SSD storage
- Backlit keyboard
- Fingerprint
- Type C charging (but they don't provide type C Charger)
- Only 1.41 kg",5
This could easily be the worse laptop at this price point as quality of the product isn't anywhere close to satisfactory....i don't knw if others have noticed it but the screen panel itself isn't installed properly into the panel housing....it could be misalignment or unsymmetric spacing between the left and right sides of the screen panel and top n bottom also.....even all the entry level laptops that i have come across have properly installed panels.....so please check carefully with the screen panel ...its not perfectly postioned......overall a really bad experience with HP ......,1
"The only notebook brand in the market offering the latest specs for under 90k. I bought the Core i5 + 512 GB SSD model in April 2021 for about 61k from a recognised HP showroom instead of Amazon. After one and a half months of usage, I can say it's one of the good ones.

Although the webcam this model has is the worst. It is not 720p HD, it's worse than a low-level VGA webcam. The video and photos are extremely grainy and tinted. I approached HP Care thinking there was an issue with this unit. Turns out it's a universal problem and they wouldn't change the unit because the hardware was fine.

Sound is pretty good, finish looks premium metal, but is plastic... hopefully durable. It's on the quiet side with respect to fans, which only make noise if you're processing something heavy like updating the BIOS or converting a rather heavy raw video file to MP4. The chiclet keyboard is good, not too creaky and the backlight feature has a dimmer setting too.

There's a handy-dandy fingerprint scanner, which is smooth and fast with tactile recognition. The display is reasonably good, but not so powerful outside. If you work outdoors a lot, you'd have to put it on full brightness. You probably won't get optimum results even then.

A little disappointed in HP Care and the declining webcam quality. Given this day and age, there is a need for at least standard quality webcams. However, considering the price and the specs, the notebook is still worth it.

Pros:
- Latest Core i5 processor
- 16 GB DDR4 Dual Channel RAM
- Lightweight and smooth design
- Reasonably good display
- Backlit keyboard
- Decent battery life ( I got 5-6 hours of heavy use
on battery, but that might be different based on what applications you're using)
- Good audio
- Intel Iris Xe graphics are really good. You don't need an extra graphic card unless you're into hardcore video editing, 3D modelling or design or
heavy gaming.
- Expandable SSD storage
- Fingerprint reader

Cons:
- Terrible webcam quality
- Metallic finish, plastic build
- Screen hinges aren't the most flexible
- Number of ports - 2 USB, 1 HDMI, 1 USB Type C, 1 MicroSD reader slot (as opposed to a full or mini SD slot, which makes it a bit difficult for DSLR users)
- Only 512 GB of SSD storage
- Colour - only Natural Silver, surface prone to scratches.

Will update if I notice anything else. Hope this helps!",4
"Hp has done a great Job with their newly launched pavilion series. This model has all the latest features and it's very quick too. Best laptop at this price point. Don't think twice, Just buy it. You won't regret it 👍🏻",5
"The product specifications are appearing worth while working with the laptop. Nice product by HP. Excellent performance, classic graphics, sound quality- a real Dolby sound much exhilarating, backlit keyboard, good battery backup upto 7-8 hrs. Slim n light weight product with elegant look. The biggest thing is its startup and log off time which hardly takes 5 to 3 secs respectively.

Pros: Nice laptop ... highly commendable.
Cons: Not yet noticed after its 3 days purchase.",5
"I dont want to talk about the specs and other technical stuff - since you can compare that and see for yourself.
Overall - its a great laptop with 16 gb ram and at this price point - its perfect for home business and personal use.

Probably cant use it for A grade gaming or heavy image editing or very heavy data processing / data science

Whats great:
1. Trackpad
2. Keyboard
3. Fast boot
4. Great look and feel
5. small and light

Whats not so great:
1. The screen cant swivel/fold beyond a few degrees
2. the cover is a dust magnet
3. the keyboard couldve been slightly better",5
"Amazing machine for Web and Android App Development.
I am using this laptop with Ubuntu and it's performance is Amazing.",5

The Product Worth it,5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Please don't buy this laptop. The screen keeps freezing. I bought this laptop for my daughters online classes but every 15-20mins whether using zoom or Microsoft teams it keeps freezing. Processor is too slow. Was coming back to HP brand after a gap of 10 years but this has reminded me that why I stayed away all these years. Please do not waste your hard earned money on this.",1
This is a review after more than 6 months of usage.I had an azuz laptop. But since I had many problems while operating it I ordered this one. At first it was good But now it keeps switching off at times. At first had 9 hR battery now only 3-4 hrs. Not happy with the purchase.,2
"After using it from last 40 days, I have observed all it's aspects deeply.

At this prize laptop looks premium. Amazing Design, I got latop with in 3 days today. It has Magnificent Processor... Amazing Display.. Easy to use. Battery is also Good. Smooth Touch pad. Overall a genniune Product for Educational and Business Purpose. Go for It.
If you want to get more advanced product just add some SDD....

Minnor Issue:- It's making some noise while running over internet.",4
"I purchased GR0011AU (1TB HDD no SSD, Ryzen 3 3250). Economical Laptop with decent performance. Battery backup around 5.5 to 6 hrs on streaming video via wifi and general browsing. I avoided purchasing extended warranty online. Instead buy from the HP helpline (number attached in photo). Registration and setup of MS Office Home and Student 2019 is tricky as the laptop has Office 365 installed as default. This (365) has to be uninstalled and the Office H&S 2019 image (3.5GB) has to be downloaded and set up. I am doing it all through the HP helpline and they are helpful.. Overall decent/good laptop for my basic requirements and very good customer support, atleast during setup.",4
"Pros:
Display quality.
Light weight.
Decent sound.
Good performance as per it's hardware.

Cons:
One main thing is it's GPU is shared memory not dedicated. Almost 2GB ram will allocated for Graphics. Felt like 4gb even it's 5.9gb usable.
Design flaws are there, rough edges like unfinished .
Heat vent is placed at bottom, so we have to keep alway on flat surface.
Very thin bezel around display.",3
Looks good 🙂😊,4
"Firstly for the correct information of all potential buyers - I have had a good experience of HP laptops. Secondly i had budget constraints (below 35k)... so I had to go for one with only HDD, not SSD. I would have loved hybrid types as those work excellent.
Thus I opted for this laptop with no SSD, only 1TB HDD, however i preferred 8GB RAM...
it has been 3 days and we have been using it for Zoom long meetings..and general surfing (no multimedia use yet). So far there are no visible issues. The fan sometimes gives out a slight burning smell and I assume it is because the circuitry is new... I shall monitor for more days and give another review on this.
The laptop's nice feature is the CORTANA support by which windows got configured smoothly, with little intervention. it did take lot of time to boot initially, but now boots up fine....
Havent faced any sound or heat issues yet.
Screen output quality could have been better..... to get the optimum brightness you have to raise the brightness to almost the limit.
Sound output is not that great.....
so far so good. will post again after a month of use.",4
Products is good....i am satisfied.....but not very first...it takes time to open a exel file.... Battery brkup good.....other facility also satisfying.,4
laptop is hanging if we install more products,1
A used product that was damaged was delivered. Absolutely appalled by this service & I can't believe a new product paid for in full was delivered in this condition,1
"I bought recently and was not disappointed with the product at all. However if you are looking for a product that supports accounting software, etc, please buy a bit higher range. Laptop is more or less fast with good screen quality. Video conferencing is easy on this laptop. Graphic card is high so gaming is good too. Overall satisfied and good for students👍🏻😊",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 After seeing the reviews I was confused. But I decided to go for this and it got delivered within 1 day. I really liked this product. Looks premium, built quality is also good and also fast. It's a good laptop under 36k. As of now, this is my review and if there will be any issue, will let you know.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Too slow and takes time to get start. If you are working on more than 2 virtual box machine then you will have worst experience ever. Machine gets hanged and restart several time.
Not worth it & it seems mentioned configuration is not up to the mark with respect to its performance...
Not Happy at all",1
"I purchased this machine for my college assignments and all
If you also need it for not so heavy tasks you must go for it",5
"I bought this laptop with 8GB of ram and 1TB HDD, and AMD ryzen 3 3250U with integrated graphics.
This laptop is good for taking online classes and web surfing.

Most of them are afraid of buying AMD processor's but you would not find any heating issues, infact AMD gives more performance with low temperature.

If you are a person who is for taking online classes and conference, then you can definately go for it.
If need for more performance, then add some 250GB SSD.
I will update my review after 6 months.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.

8gb ram and AMD processor with ryzon 3 is not compatible with this product. Itna to samsung bhi nahi hang karta. Agar ese hi laptop aane lage to ...apple ke alawa koi or laptop lega hi nahi koi...not recommend at all. Buy now and cry all the time after owing it.",1
Don't buy it seriously telling you very bad laptop you all regret after buying it not mentioned specs given hang everytime . Don't buy it,1
"Packing, look wise, is fine. It's been 3 days I am using this device. No additional application installed. But what we are gonna do with the look, performance wise it questions me is this device holds 8GB RAM or 2GB. For name sake they have said 8GB, but the time it takes to refresh n open n response its lagging... Those 4 stars is only for look n packing n build quality.",4
"I bought this laptop only for basic office functions like word editing and simple excel works. I kept my expectations low while buying it. But still this laptop didn't even reach those basic expectations. Its taking 4 mins to boot :( and work on updates forever whenever you try to shutdown or restart. I bought this relying on HP brand name and regretting now. Don't know the problem is due to processor or OS or hardware config, but whatever it is, the final result is worst.",2
Very poor performance speed . It will take more time for booting too. While click on browser or any apps it's respond very slowly.,2

"Product is low quality.within 3 days use the monitor gone blank. Also when use with internet it makes a lot of noise.
Booting is pathetic and takes minimum 4 to 5 minutes.
After paying so much amount and getting such quality is really bad.
Would never recommend any of my friends or relatives to buy this anymore.
Now waiting for hp to provide resolution.
It is 4 th day but till date no update from HP.
Amazon pls do not sell such low quality product at your site. People will ignore Amazone in future.
Not sure if I get some call back or any replacement.",1

I have been using this from 2 days its fantastic.
I mainly used this for online classes and gaming. Good performance.
Only one disadvantage: overheating",5
"Excellent product for Students. It has it all built in. Be it Windows 10, MS office life time, HD camera, High resolution display, 8 Gb ram, 1Tb HDD, High quality stereo speakers with good volume.

Pathetic experience and complete wastage of money as the laptop I only 4 days old",1

"This is my second day and the Laptop already is laggy and choppy. I have not filled the storage and neither have I installed any games and yet it already Lags. Even A lower Specs variant will perform better than this, Bad Choice",1
Fake details are given.and laptop is very slow. It's take lots of time while booting.,1

Cons:
1.Keyboard back light is not available

"This laptop comes with a good design for this price. Laptop is bit slow, and sometimes keeps hanging. If you avoid high-end applications then it's good. The best thing is comes with MS Office and Win 10 License.

You can goahead with this price and this features if not a high end user.",4
Its a wonderful system for daily usage. Not meant for heavy gaming. But handles daily usage without any lags. I would say add extra money and go for the one with an SSD as well. Might bump up the speed even more as this only has an HDD.,5

"Totally in awe of this laptop .
It’s a wonderful deal for the price. Initially being reluctant to try Ryzen but I am amazed at the speed, one may not notice the difference between intel and Ryzen . The screen calibration is upto the mark. Sound is crisp and clear. It comes with 8GB RAM and 1tb memory which makes the machine way smoother and faster.
Battery life is good for the average usage. Like WFH and online classes. May not recommend for heavy gaming.
However the only flip side is the starting time, it takes a while to start completely .
Apart from this what I totally adore is the premium look it gives at an affordable price. Doesn’t look plasticky at all .
It is a good buy, totally worth it!",5
64 Bits Windows 10 64 Bits ? Or not under this laptop. What is processer type of this HP laptop.?,3
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 We bought this laptop a week ago and use It after 3 days after delivery. Waste of money. Never seen so much slow processor like this. 8GB Ram & 1TB HDD took 10 min to shut down. AmD Ryzen processor 3 a big NO.",1
"Received defective product initially.
Battery was not changing.

But replaced immediately next day by Amazon.

Will review again after checking the performance after a week.",3
Don't buy this product. This is waste of money. Wherever you click it hangs. It was unexpected from a hp product. Their customer service is even worse. There are contact numbers given on the laptop but the call does not go through on any of the numbers. Ridiculous. My 36K goes to vain.,1
Processor very slow even though no apps or outside software loaded. There is a lag even though it's 8 gb ram and 1 TB.,5
It's freezing very frequently and been blank since an hour... i don't know what my might be the reason.. but it is disturbing my work and making me worried so much.. hp support team please help!!!,3
Heating too much ...when you open then only it starts heating... otherwise ok low weight...easy to carry.. battery also charging out in low time,3
"Weight is thin, Battery Backup, Compact Laptop at Budget price with Microsoft windows 10 genuine with Office 365
Overally it is a perfect worth. Go for it 👌",5
Amazon team did not help me to change this product - It is very slow and hangs everytime . When i called Amazon call centre they did not help me at all.,1
Value for money...but the laptop performance is slow sometimes......U can go for it!! If u r searcjing for bqsic needs rather than gaming and editing,3
"Worst performace and lagging a lot, why the hell the screen is not standard, it is very delicate.
Not satisfied.",1
Price is high. So in these laptop decrease the price then it is good. It's price is main factor. And all is well,1
Very good product at 35k.,5
Delivered a damaged product,1
overall Good performance for IT professionals.,5
Very slow .. and when once it get hanged than you have to switch off and that start... Very much problem creating pappu... middle of the important meeting... It will betrayed you..,1
"Laptop is ok for me as the purpose was online education for my Kids. However, I am disappointed with the camera. With all meetings and classes online, laptops should consider a better quality camera. With this heavy Windows 10, 4GB RAM is crying with just a couple of browser windows and Teams application in the background. Overall, the performance is just ok. With correct expectation, the engine should please you. Good luck !!",3
"The processing speed is slow,
Screen resolution, camera, build quality everything is great except the processor,battery is life about 3-4hours, it can capable of running lot of apps, you can buy it for light work and gaming",4
Camera quality is not good. Doesn't help you in these work from home situations where most of your meetings are through zoom or Google,2
"Light weight, and worth of money",4
"Brought in 29/sep on amazon sale at price of 23,000 . Laptop runs very smoothly but after dew days it starts freezing for hours and I can't do anything instead of long press power off . But I replaced it and same and new one is extremely fast .
Its been 1 week so I m sharing you my experience:
Pros :
1. Display is very good as it is full HD
2. Runs smoothly without lagging in multitasking and casual
Gaming , RHYZEN 3 3200U is better than 7th gen i3 .
3. Comes with MS OFFICE 2019
4. Stylish Design

Cons:
1. Viewing angle is not that good .
2. Below averge bettery life ( 4-5 hours on normal usage , 3 hours on gaming and heavy multitasking)

Overall value for money laptop . I will update my review after one month of usage .",5
"Hi, used the product for 20 days by now.
1. good display FHD.
2. Ryzen 3 is best compared with i3.
3. Windows 10
4. Smooth working for 4 gb ram but you have to increase it upto 12gb I guess.
5. Nice texture
6. Very good ventilation when compared with other laptop like hp.
7. Thin
8. Battery comes close to 4 hr when used for browsing or for videos I suggest use it in battery saver mode.
9. Call (mail) customer service and update warranty for up to 1 year.
10. Speakers are above average.
11. Keys are very nice to work.
12. Hinges are far better now, as it is a long one.
13. I suggest to uninstall antivirus (Windows firewall is sufficient) and install chrome for smooth usage(stop that explorer).
14. Night vision is good.
I brought it for 22k !!! U may get surprised.
So,. 5 🌟 rating.
My opinion:- go for it, it doesn't disappoint you. I think this combination is good . so, it will definitely hit high from now in the market and I will update after some usage.
Edit 1:- after 2 months
1. I feel display is not great. As it is not IPS
2. BATTERY should have been still better than this.
3. Main point is it takes time, initially though , for Right click to work.
4. AMD gives updates.
Edit 2:- After using it for 8 months now.
1.) Just increase RAM for better performance
2.) Really better than all Intel i3 processor.
3.) Don't use it for advanced gaming.
JUST HIT LIKE button
Edit 3:- After using it exactly 1.5 years.
It updates regularly, but it irritates as it takes to update for hours, initially when I start it shows lenovo logo and then going screen completely blank. It happened to me 2 times for hours. LENOVO PLEASE FIX IT.",5
I bought this for 22990 after discount in bbd ... at this price... this is the best product with pre installed Windows 10 and ms office 2019... It has office 365 which makes the excel learning easier... You need to activate ms office bcz you will get only the free trial and you can activate it without any cost. Ryzen 3 is better than i3 7th generation. As of now no issue speed is good... Multi tasking without any lagging. Thank you Amazon 😃,5
"just arrived, let me check.",5
"I am writing this review after 1 month of usage...excellent performance and whopping graphics (thanks to vega 3 graphics card) clear and crisp display with excellent color contrast more than enough sound quality due to dolby audio screen is also big unbeatable design and premium look enough storage (1TB) doesn't lag only battery backup is bit low but that is compensated by its affordable charger and fast charging support comes with several unique features and justify its price...window 10 comes out of the box..upgradable..all necessary things are provided
once you purchased this laptop I guarantee you don't regret.
note: my review is for daily casual and college use not for hardcore gaming use.",4
"I got this at 25.5k seller said he wont reduce price but its a lie now its 24k after 2 weeks =(
Anyways so i have used this for at least 2-3 weeks so i can comment on performance
- Battery Life : Not very good but not bad. Lasts 3-6 hours depending on use. If you wanna do light programming and browsing you have around 4 hours . Light gaming and browsing/music gives 3.5 hours. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR HEAVY GAMING duh for that buy a gaming laptop/xbox or whatev else that is MEANT for gaming.
-Free stuff : YOU DO GET MS 2019 (feb) now since you get feb you wont get those new logos but still all features are same. Mcaffee is free for 365 days too =)
-you can do light stuff on it
-Features that are available on high end laptops like bendable screen(180degrees) and sleek design , thin bezels ARE there. LOOKS GREAT
-AMAZING SPEAKERS
-POOR WEBCAM
Thats it :)
if you get intel i3 model around 27k then buy that. If this is at 25k buy amd a9. I think you should go for amd a9 as if this is 20/20 then that is 19/20 (just comparing but ryzen 3 isnt 20/20)
however for student needs this is perfect. IF YOU DONT DO PROGRAMING AND JUST NEED FOR browsing and making projects and play internet games buy hp chromebook at 24k which is having touch screen today.
EDIT :- BATTERY LIFE BECOMES TERRIBLE AFTER 6 MONTHS. LASTS ONLY 2 HOURS TO 4 HOURS!!!!",3
"This is bogus product. I recommend please do not buy as it is not worthy of your hard earned money. I received it two days back , hardly any app installed , still very very slow with tendency to hang frequently. Ryzen processor sucks ! Terrible experience and I am contemplating to send the product back.",1
"I purchased the Ryzen 3 edition of this laptop.

CPU performance wise it is very good for lightweight day to day work such as browsing, watching movies, some Excel and PowerPoint work etc

I am using it Transcend 110S NVMe SSD and 8 GB Crucial DDR4 2400 RAM CT8G4SFS824A and performance is much better now.

This laptop cannot use M.2 SATA SSD such as Western Digital Green or Blue M.2 SATA SSD. Only NVMe SSDs are compatible. You can install a NVMe SSD as an OS drive while still using the internal 1 TB HDD for storing files.

The screen has moderate viewing angles but you can live with that.",5
"Bought this laptop with high hopes but found out its too slow and piece of junk. Feels like I am using laptop which is 5 years old. Touchpad is worst and extremely worst in responding. Processor and GPU struggle to keep the speed up of the laptop. I have not used any heavy softwares or games untill now. My review is based upon the normal web browsing and watching netflix. Even with this kind of light load, this laptop performs worst and hangs continuously. Run away from this laptop and avoid wasting your money",1
"I will 0 stat

The product is manufactured during 2014 but delivered 2020 and not it's not working and calling lenova customer service Piller to post.
I have great respect Amazon and profer to buy Amazon against Flipkart due to its fastest service and reliability.

This purchase made to think otherwise.
If possible Amazon should consider my request to replace my laptop at the same cost which is latest manufacturing.

To ensure the product are latest to the customer.

But my mistake was that I haven't noticed due to I believed Amazon will supply good and latest product to its customers.

I don't know my message will reach to right person or not but my message will save lot of customer that do please check manufacturing date immediately after receipt of product to your door step.",1

Now my config is - 12 GB ram 240 GB ssd 1 tb hard disk . And after that the graphics memory is increase from 512 mb to 2 GB.
If you invest more than 6-7k then the laptop performed superr.",4
battery is not so good so i reduce 1 star.,4
"Worst product, never buy this model. Or may be the seller sold me a faulty product. Don't know.
Never expected this from Lenovo... Lenovo should replace my product with a new one! From day 1 the system hangs so much tried all hacks/tweaks customizations in windows 10 nothing worked !!! It's so pathetic product I can't believe. None of my PCs behaved so pathetically before this. Maybe the amd ryzen processor is of very poor quality. Total waste of money.....",1
"It's been nearly one month since I have purchased this item for my sister, for online classes , watching movies and normal uses, and it's working perfectly.
The memory partition is average as there are no much divided space all in one drive. however you will get the correct mentioned features on the product , and amazingly this item will support PUBG gaming that I saw on some other devices , however I have not tried yet. It have office software are all pre installed , need to activate those with key. overall if you are looking for a budget laptop with normal functions this is pretty good option",4
"I have purchased this laptop for my office work, I did a lot of research but due to my budget I had to settle on this laptop, I was very apprehensive earlier but this is what it is. I am not in development work only excel and some browser and Microsoft soft teams related work. The feedback of the product based on my requirement is given below.

Pros
1-: The laptop is sturdy and massive. The screen is very good.
2-: With the Windows 10 home, you get all the features of windows that are usually required for normal home or office-related work.
3-: I found the camera quality very good. My last laptop was HP Probook with a pretty high configuration and compared to that this camera feels very good. I do a lot of video calling for my office work, hence it matters.
4-: Keyboard is also good and feels nice for lot of typing and emailing.
5-: Battery is on low side, will last for 2-3 hrs only and could be improved.

Cons
1-: RAM is the problem. if you open some simple applications like 1-2 excel sheets, google chrome 1-2 tabs, MS teams your RAM consumption will start hitting the roof.
2-: You have to click and wait for 20-30 sec for any application to respond. in some cases it could be more.
3-: if you push it further it will start to crash
having said all of this the laptop is not bad, the problem is RAM. 4 Gb is not enough. This could be improved if you plan to upgrade the RAM to 8GB more, I think this laptop will be the best and will functional optimally.
in 25K you won't get a better one than this.",3
"Thrird class product....too slow to operate...like 1st generation computer
Pathetic service support
Stop working just after 4 months from purchasing
No service support, instead of working on their manufacturing issue forcing on customer handling... struggling to get service support even part is under warranty
Don't purchase.....if still u want to have...do regular pray not to have any breakdown....and u should have lot of waiting time considering the speed",1
"This laptop is worth for the price and competitive to Intel laptops. Price is less compared to Intel laptops. Performance is equivalent or better for this price. We can play some games as well using this laptop. Fully satisfied and go for it without much thinking if you are looking for good processor performance, good configuration, good battery backup for the lower price. You will not get disappointed with this. Go for it.",5
"Honest review....
I have ordered this laptop and i was very excited and happy that i got a budget friendly laptop in 24770 but when i recieved this laptop i make account etc all after 4 days it starts lagging and display blinking...
Over all marking 05/10
Body looks 10/10
Display 8/10
Graphic card 5/10
Please increase your budget and go for higher range....
Thank you.....",3
"Design is nice , performance is laggy, go for i3 ,then this or Pentium, battery backup upto1:30 hour , display is nice but viewing angles are too bad , doesn't respond in opening two applications in background as chrome or power point,
Or perhaps I get a defective piece
And Amazon says saw to service center
And it's four day of use",2
The laptop is actually great. I loved setting it up..it's very responsive. Excellent for online classes types! Application. But the issue is the seller.. I noticed the camera didn't work..that too at the end after paying for anti virus..which I will not get back..I later noticed some stains. Near the F4 key and on the top of my laptop( I didn't add that picture) I found it and reported it to the Amazon contact center centre team. They really understood my problem and were willing to refund. The point is Amazon is superb. The laptop is superb. The seller needs a kicking. My hard earned money after being a covid positive and removed.. spent so much on medical support. And now this from the seller..wanted to write ..the laptop is superb!.,5
"It's unfortunate I had to return this laptop cos it was slow and had been slightly damaged when shipping otherwise all the other features were good. I'm not too sure whether i3 7th gen would have made a difference or not but I think 8GB RAM was definitely needed for this to run smoothly. Best budget piece at 27500. If more RAM were given and priced at 30k, I'd have still bought it, cos it had a 15.6"" FHD Screen, 1TB HDD, MS Office 2019 & even remained cool. No overheating. The battery lasted for 5 Hours at least. If it comes back in stock, I'll buy it again!",5
When I swithched on the product double tap right click not working . went google and edited some registry settings then worked. system was sluggish . I added 8 GB extra RAM . Now system runs smoothly. It has 4 GB RAM inbuilt in motherboard and one empty ram slot. BUILD quality average but design eyecatching. keyboard does not feel premium in typing but okay for average user.,3
"Edit:
The difference in performance after adding and booting from SSD drive is phenomenal! It feels like a completely new (much slicker) laptop now!
Although, I realised all too late that the SSD slot on the laptop supports NVME type SSD (and not SATA). Choose what you buy carefully.

Original Review:
I've had this laptop for 9 months now and can confidently say it's woefully underpowered. I knew even at the time of buying that 4GB ram might be too less and that was apparent on the day I powered the laptop on. Booting took ages and everything worked at grandma speed.

I upgraded the ram to 12GB the first week of operation itself which helped quite a bit. However, I've struggled to get anything important done on this laptop in the last 9 months of owning it. I mostly use it to watch Netflix or maybe light surfing on chrome.

Recently figured that the HDD itself is also a bottleneck, and have now had to order a additional SSD to run the OS in. Hopefully that will solve it for me.

Verdict : buy only if you're comfortable upgrading the laptop on your own or have access to a cheap repair shop. Total cost for me - 25K (laptop) + 2.5K (8GB RAM) + 3.5K (250GB M2 SSD) which I think is still much cheaper than buying an equivalent laptop directly.",3
"Quite a nice product for the budget! This is a review after 2 weeks of usage:

Pros:
1.ryzen 3 rocks ! It's amazing and faster than i3 and even i5.
2.great for everyday usage and buissness ,as it have office 365 pre installed, you can claim em easily.
3.build is good, and flexible.
4.has a PCIe m.2 connector.
5.can able to play counter strike in steam without lag.
6.it has full HD display
7.does not lagg offten even if I use heavy application.

Cons :
1.BATTERY! Battery charges quick as well as drys quick. 3 h of normal use like online class can empty your battery.
2.color! I hate this all gold color
3.no USB c port

But it's nice , go for this not for the i3 !

Edit 1 : this product really sucks in battery life but it's quite and amazing in performance. No issues found.",4
Ordered the product on 18th may and the product got delivered on 26th may .. laptop is v fast in this price range.. i got it for Rs 26490..ryzen 3 processor is v fast compare to i3 7th gen ..battery is lil bit a disadvantage . 3-4 hrs backup depending upon usage . If u play games then only it will for 1 hrs 30 mins or so although this laptop is not for gaming but with vega graphics u can still play few games.. already used the laptop for a week . Booting time is s close to 16 -25 seconds which is v gud .i hv purchased it for some medium work .studying n excel work and light gaming and if want to do heavy work than upgrade ram and also ssd slot available. Display quality is v gud crisp n clear display . Overall the product meet the expection and thank you appario ..always go with u only in future .. till now no issues .. will update more abt the laptop after a month thank u,5
"I bought this for my 10 years old. For a starter who plans to use a laptop for browsing, attending online classes, playing not-so-heavy online games, basic documentation works (word, powerpoint, excel) - this is a good enough one.

Pros:
- Value for money laptop.
- Comes with inbuilt Windows 10 and pre-installed MS Office packages.
- Relatively thin and light weight.
- Good key pad arrangement
- Touch pad with in-built click buttons
- Ryzen-3 processor, takes a minute or two for booting but this is expected as this does not come with SSD.
- Haven't observed any heating issues so far even after a continuous use of 4-5 hours or gaming or video.
- Came with 1 year warranty. There was a student offer - 3 years extended warranty + On-site service + Sony headphone with mic for Rs.1799. It's a very good deal.
- Decent battery life of 3-4 hours of continuous use.

Cons:
- Screen resolution is not so great
- Webcam quality is poor
- In-built speaker quality is decent not loud enough. We are using it with a headphone.
- Charger has a peculiar shape and design.
- There a warranty date mismatch which was sorted out after talking to the customer care.

Go for it, if you plan to buy this for kids or basic daily use.",4
"Everything fine. Got Windows 10 (Full version), MS office Full version and Mcafee Antivirus 1 year. Coming laptop design is very cool and very smooth. But i found only one issue which is battery will dry fast i mean mostly will get 3 hours only.

Any way very good laptop.",4
"Warning* these are all faulty and refurbished products by Lenovo. Had my own tech guy check it out and it's obvious that they are all old faulty products, refurbished and sent to customer with the hoax of an ""offer price"". Lenovo is known for this, and it shows when you try to reach out to them for a replacement, they say the invoice is more than a week old and cannot be replaced even though the warranty is a year. Multiple emails and DM's later, they still won't respond for a replacement. The laptop hangs and freezes everytime as users have mentioned here. It doesn't want to connect to a WiFi connection and you always need to disable the adaptor every now and then. My suggestion, go for a Parle G laptop or a chor baazaar laptop, but stay away from Lenovo. I would even suggest Dell, but never Lenovo just for the fact that you would be paying full price for faulty and old products. Amazon is also part to blame for having such sellers who won't even bother to help customers once payment is done.",1
"Received the product on time, within 3 days. The laptop looks premium. Even though it is plastic body, it looks like aluminum. The thin bezel screen gives a stylish and latest look for the laptop. The specs are good. As youtube reviews states, the RAM and hard disk can be upgraded, which is a great thing. Since the hard disk is empty and there aren't much programs, the laptop is fast as of now. MS office is provided. The sound on this laptop is good. Everything works fine. Happy with the product.",4
"Software got corrupted after 7 months of use, but can understand that . However the real pain is getting their service centre guys to understand the problem. Different people gives different diagnostics and issue resolution tips. Nothing works. Finally they said they are not responsible for OS and reach out to Microsoft, that too under warranty.which I feel was a compleletely irresponsible way of dealing with a customer. So if you are a techie and can service your own laptops, go for it. If not pls don't. I had to shell out money from my pocket, when the product was still under warranty.",2
"After a 6 month use, we just can't find any problems. Well this proves to be the best choice at this range in spite of not having a fingerprint sensor and USB type C port. Below are the reasons :

1. Comes With MS Office
You might see reviews starting they didn't receive the office package. That isn't true. Sometimes they wouldn't have found where it is.

2. Super upgradable(if wanted for heavy tasks)
You can expand its RAM up to a massive 20 GB and it has an additional M.2 NvMe SSD port. That's a boon.

3. Immersive audio experience
Dolby does makes the audio much better.

4. Lenovo online Support
Well driver downloading isn't a problem now. The website detects your system and does it automatically (drivers excluded in Windows updates)

5. Light Gaming
Not much I can ensure but you can play games like ones of Assassins creed family,most racing games and other stuffs in medium graphics.

Rest you can find in the other reviews as well. So just didn't mention.

The only con is the battery life.
Standard - 5 hours
Multi tasking - 4 and half hour
Gaming or other heavy tasks - 3 hours.
(avg. Depends on the games)

Still it isn't that big con.
That's all guys",5
"Keyboard is alright but number keys are not working and that is the reason I gave it 1 star.
So please solve it.",1
"Overall an 'OKAY' laptop. Amazing looking laptop (doesn't mean it's an amazing laptop though). If you're getting it for 25k and below that, it's the best laptop one can own at that price range. For I had to pay a bit more(28k) as GST had increased at the time (19 June 2020). I bought this for college assignments (on social sciences). It was urgent for me to buy and the screen impressed me when I saw this laptop on videos.
I had a lot of expection with the screen when it arrived but the Full HD, anti-glare technology screen is misleading; ""anti glare"" is just for the name's sake, yes it doesn't reflect so much of light but it's definitely is not 'anti glare', it should have been named ""less glare"". Moreover, it's side angle view is quite annoying at times, esp. if there are many people in a room watching movie in it. However it's 15.6 inch display almost feels like a standard desktop's screen and has a resolution better than that of hp and acer laptops of this price range. So if you are a student looking a laptop for basic college works at low buget then this is the one for you but only if you are not angry with China because yes it's made there. Haha. Happy shopping.",3
Worst product ever dont buy even for free its super slow damn slow and once u ordered it from amazon then u cant even return it such that i personally recommend you to not buy this product most disappointing product i have ever ordered.,1
"I have a complicated review about this laptop but what i am writing is 100% true.
Pros-
1) Screen is quite big and it is full hd.
2) Keypad is big and is great. Also spacing between keys is good.
3) Touchpad is good and big.
4) Laptop design is good and stunning.
5) Ideal for coding , browsing and noraml tasks.
You can also play some great games like cod mw ,NFS hot pursuit etc.
Cons-
1) Build quality is good but it easily gets stained by by fingerprints and I don't know how to remove these fingerprints.
2) It is little bit laggy sometimes when you start your pc but after sometime it gets normal.
3) Brightness is less when you are not charging but increases as I connect the charger.
4) Battery backup is not that bad around 3 hours backup is there.
5) Camera quality is not that good.
I highly recommend you all that prefer ssd over hdd beacuse in this laptop hdd is bit slower so pls buy a ssd laptop. It would be so great.
Also try to get 8 gb ram laptop.
This laptop has 4gb ram and 1 empty slot for ram upgrade and also a eampry slot for ssd.",4
"I m so disappointed that I just requested for return. I already have a Lenovo laptop and this made me confident to go with this brand. About the product, installation instructions are smooth. Issue starts afterwards. First heartbreak you will find the performance. When you try to open web browser like app, it will open with so delay that you once think of, have I clicked the app or not. Even my daughter who has used mobiles and laptop wondered, such delay actually happens in now world. Coming to sound, it's average.
Second most disappointment is with camera. Due to Covid19, she is having virtual class and when she attended first session from this laptop, it was quite dark. She switched to my laptop again, to resume her class. With such configurations, I was really expecting that it will stand good for my kids requirement. Either I mistakenly got bad laptop or my choice is not good. Let's see, when this laptop gets replaced, it will change for better or not... Not expected for Lenovo... :(",1
"I purchased this laptop for 24500 which is a total steal for this laptop. Ryzen 3 works fine, don't expect to run heavy applications or games on it. 4gig of Ram and 1Tb HDD is also great for the price. The screen is a total plus point, its an FHD screen, it's a VA panel I guess but for anyone, it's much much better than those 768p HD displays. It is sharp and great to look at. Not good with the viewing angles (obviously a VA panel), but it is good enough.
The speaker is fine and the keyboard is also fine for me. The battery life also seems to be okay with about 3-4 hours of backup. Only get this laptop if you are a normal user that does browsing, watching movies and typing or for basic office use, do not expect more than that.
What I would suggest is to increase the ram to 8 gigs and if you can, please replace the HDD with a 2.5 inch SSD. Just by doing these 2 things, it will run much more smoothly than you can even imagine.",5

I had purchased the said product for my daughter considering that all the schools had to operate online due to Covid 2019 pandemic. However, since day one i.e. June 09, 2020 the said product did not perform as required and we faced speed issue on number of occasions. It takes ample of time for any application to open. Due to these issues, my daughter was unable to concentrate in her studies and her performance was badly affected. She is mentally disturbed because of very slow performance of the said product.

In the month of December 2020, I had called the customer care and I was informed to set-up the Lenovo diagnostic tool and scan the laptop on regular basis. I followed the instructions provided to me, however, the problem could not be fixed and my daughter continued to suffer hardships and mental harassment.

Recently, I once again called the customer care and was forced to lodge a complaint on March 04, 2021. On a lot of back and forth with the customer care, I was informed that the said product will perform slow on Windows 10 and that I should use Windows 08 for the said product to perform properly. I was shocked and surprised with this information considering the fact that representation to purchase the said product on Amazon website in June 2020 was specifically with Windows 10 preloaded in the said product for Home Edition.

When I told them to replace, they denied.",1
"Got my laptop worst experience with that within a week. Laptop is slow and freezes continously
Will take long time to get Into laptop and I wonder how can people try to work from home with this type of laptop. Disappointed totally.

And also the display is dull.
Coming to looks it’s pretty good
Also it is asking for the license for MS OFFICE products,
. Disk will always be full with very low performance..",1
"It's been a month since purchase I want to share my personal review

This laptop is definitely a good choice only if you are here for study purpose and light game like gta SA ,vice city etc but when it comes to heavy gaming like valorant,gta V and similar this laptop isn't a good choice.
This laptop have 512 MB of vram so you guys already know what you can do in this.

Battery backup
Battery backup for this laptop is lowest it shows it will work for 3 hrs but even if I leave it at standby without any process it hardly last for 1.5-2 hrs so poor battery backup.

Ram
4gb ram isn't enough for your processes even many a times my Microsoft office hangs so make sure you attach a good ram after purchase preferably a 8gb.

Touchpad and Keyboard
Touchpad is cool and sleak designed it's too good but inbuilt buttons are there so be gentle to it and keyboard keys are also soft and handy must say.

Complimentary:-

You will get a Microsoft ofgice 2019 student edition for lifetime more than sufficient even for many office works.
And you get mc afee antivirus one year subscription free as well though mc afee isn't the best antivirus out there but it will help.
Both are pre installed and for activation you just need to open and login to both.

Software
Software is very good but again it's because ram that the software isn't that much effective.

Pros
Low price,ms office lifetime,mcafee one year,amd ryzen 3 and vega 3 integrated mobile graphics,180° rotate.

Cons
Battery,laggy,low gaming.",3
"Bought it for 27,990/- so reveiw is basis this price amount.
Good slim machine.
Value for money - No.
Should be good in 22-24k price range.
Slow processing on everything.
Brand New machine takes over 6 minutes to start. (Strange).
Hinges of screen looks very flimsy, so not sure how long it will last.
Screen brightness low.
Brand new Battery giving max 2.5 hours",3
"The build quality is excellent and the keyboard as well. The battery life lasts around 5 to 6 hours. The audio is good and the display as well. It is fast and responsive. However, the track pad is awful and the camera color acurracy is non-existent and you can see marks on laptop created 👋. It can play games that are very light. overall it is a good product",4
"I bought this laptop as I had some urgency.. It has windows 10 & MS office within a reasonable price.. I got the product on Sunday.. After using 1-2 hours I found laptop touchpad is very insensitive.. Left click working right click not working.. After using 1 day I found laptop is terribly slow.. It takes 15-20 mins to open & 10-12 minutes to close.. Any app like ms excel, google chrome takes 2-3 mins to open after click.. Unable to run multiple applications.. Laptop gets hanged.. It has Macfee antivirus free version for 30 days.. But it delets most of the files downloaded from internet.. So I had to uninstall it.. Now I don't know how to use it later.. Really frustrated after the experience..",1
On first day motherboard crashed totally lost joy of new laptop bt thanks to lenovo they replace motherboard . Think before buy this product. If this issue happen after a year nearly it cost 17000 rs . (Feels like refurnish product from amazon ) otherwise ok ok motherboard issue,1
I'm writing this review after 5 months of usage. I'm completely disappointed with the performance of the laptop. I don't use it for gaming or any excessive work. I use it for regular purpose and for a basic excel work. It is taking unusual time to ON and to open any app. Intel Low processor Laptops are better than AMD ryzen 3 laptops. Please go with I3 if you are planning for ryzen 3. You feel bad for the performance after purchase. Don't do a mistake like me.,1
"Poor battery life, just got it and in 6 months battery is dead. Screen blacks out often while working, System hangs frequently, Can't work on more than two programs, system slows down, laptop gets heated very quick. Service not good for Lenova. Local service don't respond to the issue and ask the customer to register a complaint with Lenova customer care whatsapp number and there is only automated response and no response to the issue.",1
"Great for daily home use. Mine came with 4GB of memory, which is bare-minimum now to support modern web browsing. Google’s Chrome browser consumes a lot of memory, so go for 8GB if you have the option. The CPU seems speedy enough. My one honest annoyance is that, like many laptops, the screen tint appears slightly more bluish—white skews slightly blue. I didn’t see this on my old MacBook Pro, so it may just be a Windows issue with the available color profiles. I mentioned home use, because the top of the lid scratches easily, so taking this on the road would likely induce scratching from rough handling. The thing which I didn't like at all is the battery life, Its battery life is very low i.e. after full charging it survives only for 2-2.5 hrs with continuous use. I think its high time Lenovo should really focus on this particular thing.",3
"I bought this laptop since my son needed one for his online classes.
Got this Laptop delivered on June 22nd , setting up took 2-3 hours , but then the issues started. The laptop is extremely slow , launching a word doc takes 3-5 minutes . Logging into MS Teams takes forever , failed to even suit the purpose it was bought for . My 9 year old ACER works much faster than this one.
Logged a complaint with Amazon and the technical support person was good , but the issue still remains the same.
Now waiting for the technical support person to visit physically and check the laptop . But seriously I would want to return this and go for something better like HP or Dell.
A mistake that I am regretting now.",1
"Let's keep it short.
First of all please update the windows 10 version to 1909. My laptop stopped working from second day. After updating its working fine.
Perfect for watching YouTube video, MS Office work, running basic photo editing software like Photoshop. But please do not try to play games or install video editing software. It might crash. So in short, only for BASIC work.",4
"After 6 Months of usage :

It is good for people who uses light applications like microsoft office, photo editing but its not for gaming , multitasking and video editing.

Battery lasts for 2 hours for continuos working.

Webcam is Ok for zoom calls

Trackpad is smoothly working

Keyboard is not much good.

Sound Quality is good.

Viewing angles of display are not good.

Hinges loses after 3 months.",3
"It has been delivered to me by courier service on 21-jan-2020.
till i am not facing any issue at starting its feel to me that system slow but its Fine,overall Performance was very Good but I'm feel battery drains very fast
............................................
what is Good
*window 10 life time validity
*Free ms Office
*Good Speed

What is bad as I experience.
*Battery drains very fast
*little bit slow but Its Good

As Per All above Calculations its is fantastic Must buy this.
THANKS AMAZON",5
"The product is very poor . it's laggy and also hangs alot . And here's the bonus the battery is extremely poor . It says 5.5 hrs battery life but last only 1:30 to 2 hrs max . And the office well it only shows due to network problem we are have issues to activate and the wifi too u connect automatically doesn't work u always need to go n hit the connect again n again .
Refund is impossible so incase if u bought also n want to return well that's impossible u will directed to page where an expert will talk to you . I also tried to talk and I waited 30 mins and atlast the call got automatically disconnected.
Overall the laptop is very very very bad .and it have stupid place for touchpad . U are going to suffer to much if u buy it like I am .",1
"This is good laptop for office/daily use.
For programming- there is a slowness with eclipse IDE & other dB connections but still works pretty well.
Battery life is average for continues Netflix & online streaming (2-3 hrs). Apart from that battery life is good, close to 5-6 hours.
Built quality is average, I personally would have liked more improvement in built quality.
You get MS office suite 2019 & antivirus (1 year) with this laptop.
This is not at all a gaming laptop. The ryzon 3 processors & intel i3 6th gen are somewhere equal at performance barrier. For the range of 25k-30k I found this is currently best laptop.
Note: I wanted to use ryzon processor over intel.",3
"1. Good for light browsing and office related tasks (Docs, PDF files etc).
2. Screen has sufficient brightness and is of perfect size
3. Not too heavy so convenient for regular use
4. WiFi works without a sweat and did not face issue like freq disconnection etc
5. Achilles's heal - HDD speed. SSD is must for a good flawless performance. So its a must upgrade for sure",4
"Horrible product not at all suitable for online classes in the middle of the class the screen is filled with colourful lines and then goes fully black
And the battery life doesn't even last for an hour
A total waste of money",1
My case warranty issue ...I contact Lenovo center . Lenovo update warranty of one year......second thing is it is very good machine ryzen processer is very good no lagging. And it motherboard board m.2 sloat available after installing pcie nvme ssd it's work like roket.,5
"Very Good product at this price range. I bought it for 27k.
Good Performance
Speed as mentioned is getting above 2GHz
Anti glare screen is perfect unless it is very bright light on background.
Don't go for other AMD models.
At this price range AMD Ryzen is providing much better performance even morethan i3.

Battery life is bit low Around 3 to 3 1/2 hrs.

Those who are looking for basic model laptop go for it.
This product will exceed you expectations for sure.",5
"The product was initially freezing a bit but after I installed another 8 GB of RAM, it's super smooth. I found out the culprit was the intregated graphics which uses a lot of RAM. Infact after I installed 8 gb and when my total ram became 12 gb, only 9.32 gb was available for use. Test was used by system resources.",4
"I'm not a heavy user, I need a laptop to serve the internet, occasionally watch some videos and prepare my presentations and Lenovo Ideapad S145 perfectly suit my needs. The best budget laptop that I ever owned (got Dell i3 laptop before). Ryzen 3 is much better than i3. Windows 10 home and ms office lifetime pre installed is additional plus point.",5
"I bought this in January 2020 before Pandemic. It is unbelievable, there are many defects with the basic design. when it is folded, the screen is touching the keypad and the impressions are now on the screen, just after 6 months of use. one side of the outer margin of the screen is not properly resting while closing. To add all to this, the system is very slow right from the beginning. I am using programs like MS office but still, it is taking time just to open programs like MS Word. should check if this has a warranty... I do not recommend this.",1
"The features are ok i purchases it on dec 2019 today being 4 dec 2020,thought if giving a review though i just use this laptop for mails basically workpurpose so from my point of view there is lagg while starting / the mousepad alreading begin to freeze / the page flikkers ,i mean i do not use the laptop like a hardcore even just for office mails ,forget gaming or anything else just basic",3
"If somy looking for laptop for simply using for only study and internet surfing and explore sosial platforms then this laptop is fine to buy but if you want to use this laptop for office use or bussines use then this laptop is not for you

Because this laptop is very slow in processing and Boot time is also very high and never play any games in this laptop it will more slow in processing.",2
"System does not boot to windows 10 since 1st week of May 2021.Posted complaint in Lenova site, but no possitibe action. Today received mail to get it repaired at their service station on chargeable basis.",1
"Description mentions Windows 10..turns out to be Windows 10 SL. Description also mentions MS Office. Turns out same is Home and Student edition. Would appreciate if correct info is shared. Other than this, product appears to be as desired and delivery was timely. Can comment more only after usage.",2
"Worst, hanging issues, camera low quality battery not good",1
"I'm disappointed with battery. Yesterday only I recieved. It was taking 2 hrs and 20 minutes but backup is just 4 hrs. And I'm installed euro truck simulator 2 game , when it is running I found soo many lags. I like the design and it looks. Display also very nice. Over all it's a best laptop in 28k.",4
"Laptop is bulid is good quality and finish is good . It's bit slow compared to price range . Other wise it's good quality and looks is good

It's not for gamers or fast responses",2
"Good configuration at this price under 25K. Low battery backup. Very slow. But after I upgraded storage by adding M2. NVME SSD 250 GB and installing Windows 10 on it the system runs very fast. Also, added one 8 gb DDR4 ram in the free RAM slot. Screen FHD display is preety good. Overall value for money is great considering they also pre-installed MS office 2019 Home and Student for life time and MS Windows 10 Home Single Language.",4
"I brought this product with pre-installed Windows . After one month of use laptop got very slow. Without running any app, you can see memory and disk are running with 100% capacity. I reached out to Lenovo customer service and they told that to run the Windows 10 I should upgrade the RAM of this product to 8GB(minimum).",1
"The laptop had glitches ever since i got it. It is very slow and keeps lagging.
It has been just 3 months since i got it and some keys are not working even though I have handled the laptop with care.",2
The product is sound with good asthetics. The processor under perform with the OS. Its painfully slow. It works all good apart from that but the processor is slow as it can be for a modern PC for its price. You are better off with another higher processor for this model. Dont just look at the design look for better processor but not this one. Invest a little more and you will be happy. I regret purchasing just for the speed of the PC.,2
"Not so happy, I thought AMD processor is more powerful than i3.But after buying it, I am not happy with the speed of AMD. Very very slow processor!
Battery life poor,if open more than one task it hangs.Even restart is not working.You have press the power button for few seconds.",2
The laptop is sooooo slow that it cannot do even basic operations. It takes 5-10 mins to start and takes another 10 mins to open microsoft word or excel. Basic text writing or basic excel operations like addition are enough to hang the system. Lenovo has not been responding for past several months. We need to buy another one since this one is just a useless box. Amazon please help in getting support from Lenovo.,1
"osm laptop very good brand i always lenovo lapotp because it is available very cheap price with high confrigration and i must recommended this laptop beacuse i cheak this confrigration i other brands but there charge is too high with this same specification .
amd processor is very fast and cheaper price comparison to intel .
and this price segment osm price provide by lenovo .",5
"If u r looking for a better smooth PC Chromebook then I would recommend you to go for atleast Rs +40k. Screen is not so good , working a little bit laggy , speed is not so fast , I would not recommend this for any gaming or official works , etc. But it's good for net surfing that's all.",3
"The product delivered started hanging from day 2, I use only excel, word, gmail and no other apps still it had issue while doing alt tab,it takes time to switch between two screens, hangs. I contacted online support they checked the machine and says increase RAM and show it to lenovo service centre.",1
"I ve never used AMD Ryzen 3 or any processor from that brand. This computer is super slow, slower than intel pentium gold. I ve been using the Ms office and all, usually opeining documentary files. If you open 5-6 tabs on google chrome, it hangs. Is it any defect? Should I return the product?",2
"I am using this laptop for 6 months now. Product was received in best condition. I had to use it majorly for Excel and Word file operation. It takes a bit longer to start as compared to other brands, maybe coz of Rayzen processor. Otherwise there are no complaints till date. Processor is bit slow as compared to Intel.",3
"The product hangs like anything. Use Microsoft Office, browse the web, trying watching something online, trying doing some basic work stuff, there is nothing the machine does smoothly.

Its the worst choice ever you could make for a laptop.

No value for money",1
"Very slow in processing for applications.
Worked properly for 10days. Later on.. it started suffering me.

I am facing the worst experience. I am using dual core processor which pc, which is 13year old. It is better than this laptop.",1
"This is a very useless product don't buy it, and there is only a replacement policy & no refund. The PC freezes for a long time after every 15-20minutes also the trackpad keeps locking on its own. Doesn't match 4gb ram by any chance. I'd suggest you to buy a different product but not this one. It's been giving me problems from the very 1st day like going blank & freezing or hanging.",1
"It is value for money but battery has an issue to give you around 2 to 3 hrs with continues work and face some minor lag issue which is negotiable I thought !
After all this laptop is best for students who make PPT or word documentation....

Thanks,
Lenovo & unbox Therapy
From
Rohit",5
It's a good laptop for normal usage. If you facing problem (slow performance) than uninstall the antivirus (macfee live safe). You will see a great change in performance.,4
"Almost 1 year I am using it.
Seems it has a 2 bit processor. Now I am working on it, and the
Browser has not opened in last 15 min. God knows what's happening.
It's like that from the beginning. Too slow. TOO SLOW.
Pathetic. Oh god! Why companies are manufacturing thes things.",1
"Nice product by Lenovo. Windows 10 +MS Office.
Ryzen CPU system, all going well But absence of DVD system merely con property.",4
Pathetic laptop. Very very slow. Don't buy strongly suggested don't buy. I purchased for my daughter's online classes. Earlier we using Samsung J max TAB. Samsung tab speed much better than this laptop. Even Amazon should remove from market place,1
Honestly it's too slow. You better go for ryzen 5 and with min 8 gb RAM. Got it a year back at 24k now they are selling above 30k,4
Very worst laptop pls don't buy . for normal use also this pc can't able to sustain. hanging while opening Excel and all the application.and after 1 year this is suddenly can't able to on the pc.,1
"Laptop is very slow. Once I installed the softwares which I need, it got very slow and stucked in the same page for a while. I Recommend you not u buy. Customers are trusting and buying in online kindly do not provide this type of products and disappoint us.",1
"Not Good for the regular used for limited business . Condition is good I brought at Rs 27000/-, but very very slow even excel is not able to perform properly. We try to reach lenovo but they are help less only suggestion was received from Lenovo is increase RAM and SSD.",2
"Within 10 days laptop started is getting hanged, Its very slow. Takes minutes to open any app or wondow.
And Amazon refused for return now. Very bad experience.
Think hundred times to purchase expensive electronics items from Amazon.",1
"The product is having many issues, Microsoft Office is not activated. Microphone jack is not working. Amazon has not even sent an invoice for the purchase. They had said one year onsite warranty but they have not given any details. I am not able to contact Amazon or lenovo. I feel like the computer is a waste of money.",1
Don't buy this product. The processor is very slow. Even simple apps like windows take at least 2-4 minutes to open. Jumping from window to window is a nightmare. The technical team is very bad. They put you hold for 30 mins at a stretch and even after that it gets disconnected. No call backs.,1
"Laptop is slow
it maybe the 4gb ram bottle neck.
Rest all is good
the chrger have high width in its plug which causes a little discomfort",3
I have purchased the product on 28 feb and when scanned warranty qr it says it has started on 20th dec 2019. What is going in is it used product and what about office which us mentioned in description ?,3
"Very bad product,don’t bye it simple it’s waste of money also there is no option for return or replacement also battery life is very bad,pls don’t waste your money ,also will not get response from Amazon technical team",1
"If you want a good battery and good sound please don't purchase it, worst battery life and sound is very very low, design is good working good after update camera is 0.3 MP don't even want to talk about it if you have some more budget please go with HP or Asus Vivo book.",3
Separate keyboard for digits is one of the plus point. Good for online classroom. But u have to purchase dvd player and mouse separately,5
"Good laptop, i have purchase in only Rs.24000

Rayzen is better than i3 processor.

But in windows 10 os Speed slower than windows7 os

If we install windows 7 in this laptop then drive note support to this laptop.",5
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Totally waste of money don't buy this",1
"The product is very good. Lot of things bundled in this thin and lightweight package. The body is of average material. Ethernet port should be there for better connectivity. Camera is very poor. Processor is bit slow when compared with i5,7th gen.",4
It hangs all the time I don't know if this problem occurs only in my unit but battery life is also very poor . The claimed 4-5 hours of continuous battery life is a fuke .In all a very bad experience.,1
Ideal for light users. Do not very much expectation such as budget laptop. Not bad purely value for the money.,5
"It is very faulty product, please dont buy. I have purchased on 17 june. Only after 3 month use. Many keyboard button are not working like windows , shortcuts. While booting automatically password appears and got hanged. Also numeric keypad is also not working",1
Its damn slow due to various useless programs that comes with pre-installed windows.... uninstall irrelevant programs and mainly mcafee ...it will give a decent performance. If possible upgrade the ram and hdd to ssd and you will have a perfect system.,4
One of the worst Laptops ever seen. If you really have time to wait till this useless thing start then go for it. One of the biggest mistakes done..,2
"Battery life even with advanced power saving setup lasts flat 3.5hrs. this is very low for a laptop of this configuration. Otherwise the design is really good, keyboard and all other aspects a great. Comes without a mouse or laptop bag.No freebies!",3
"i have ordered ryzen 3 but i receive A9 which was already 9 months used and having motherboard issue and no support from Amazon
but good service of lenovo whose technician came and replaced the old motherboard with a fresh new one without a penny",2
"It can handle your every day task with ease
Only flaw in it is battery back up
It lasts only for 3 to 4 hours...max
It's not for gaming as u must know..
Other than these issues it's a beautiful piece
Reviewing it after 2 day use..",4
"I got this laptop at 24000, it provides free MS OFFICE for life time free, very good performance up on updated, good display, bettery is disappointing 4-5 hours on heavy usage",5
"Promise we’ll kept - product delivered was exactly as shown.
Additional packages included at a reasonable cost (Lifetime MS Office, lifetime Antivirus).",5
"Over all very good.
Only 1 issue I found unacceptable is poor battery backup. Lasts no more than 2-3 hrs",3
Ultimate lappy in this price segment.college students go for it.good service once again thank you Amazon and appario retail.i always order from this seller only.....,5
Laptop is good but saller send me a defective piece in which screen is not working properly and on the laptop box there was no seal. And when i turn on laptop it was already contain a password which show saller send me used laptop.,1

Not for gaming hang and blackout.",1
Wot I dint like is it’s written it includes usb cables but I cud not find any ... ders only d charger and d laptop and d Oder things are missing .,3
The camera quality is devastating and it hangs a lot. I am really disappointed. Bought it in urgency. Single click takes 20seconds to respond.,1
I'm writing this review after 5 months of purchase. Overall it is fine but can't be used for heavy work..only for listening music watching videos or ms office..,3
The Product is somehow fine but I still didnt got the cashback. It would take 90 days to commence the 10% HDFC bank that is something i really hate about the cashback system...i bought on sept last and its already january but still didnt got the cashback.,1
It's not that much good for gaming but best for a student and office work as it give office19 home&student version free with it but I got it in higher price but you can buy it cheaper so it is value for money,5
My only problem is with battery life. It says here at description that aberagr battery life is 5.5 hrs but i don't think so. I haven't even used it for an hour and it has consume more than 40% of battery life. It isnt value for money😡😡,2
"It can run gta 5 with 20-30 fps in low setting with gb of 4gb ram.
It has 4gb ram and vega 3 showing 512 mb dedicated graphics and 1.7 gb shared memory but after adding 8 gb of ram i get 2gb dedicated graphics and 4 gb shared memory",5
"The lenovo seal was already opened when I took it out of the Amazon delivery box, which itself was unopened. So, was a little suspicious. It's been 2 days. The laptop seems fine as of now. Will monitor for a few more days.",3
This is a defective Product and AMAZON is not letting me to return or exchange. more than 8 people joined the customer care chat but none helped this is big time scam.,1
"Very nice product since I have purchased,
Working smoothly, No any issues till date,
Pre installed windows and Ms office is a great advantage, offers and discount is a great help, Worth for money",5
Overall very nice product. Full HD display and colours are good. Key travel is also less. Trackpad gestures works well. The build quality of laptop is very good.,5
This laptop can't perform even simpler tasks like opening a web browser without hang. HDD can't handle basic IO. Even the processor is not up to the mark. Please don't buy it.,1
The product is really good except for battery life it is dying faster and have to be frequently charged.,5
This product is too slow not even you can work on excel sheet I returned the laptop on same day ! For the service of amazon too good but this laptop is too pathetic.,1
"Good product at this price but viewing angle of display is not very good and sometimes its lags. If you want to do less work like browsing ,reading then it's good. It comes with Dolby audio but sound is low.",3
"Do not get this ,within a one month's period it has become extremely slow.
Dissapointed",1
Battery life is decent its not for very high performance computing. Ryzen processor is good and fast at this price. Perfect for regular use and mild gaming. Nice display for movies and more.,4
"Laptop speed is very slow ..
Amazon team please suggest, Laptop received 40 minutes back and working very slow.
Please let me know....",1

"Bought this exact laptop from nehru place for 27,000. Here are some pros and cons:
Pros
1. Good processor
2. 1080p anti glare display
3. 180° hinge
4. lifetime ms office (hardare linked, you cannot use it on other devices
5. mcfee antivirus for 1 year (not the best antivirus out there but does the job)
6. have an m.2 slot
Cons
1. bellow average battery life (will last you 3 hours at max, other at this price gives better battery)
2. soldered ram with only one slot empty
3. not so good touch pad
4. the finish on the laptop looks pretty but my fingerprints got imprinted on it.",4
"Ordered this laptop for my daughter's school. I received the laptop on time but the screen was damaged (No physical damage was seen on the box or to the laptop!), but when I turned on the laptop, half the screen was blur!. Never seen such damage before. Nervous about the product the damage, called Amazon service immediately. I was on the call for 35-40 minutes while they asked me to send the pictures and verified them and got approval for the replacement and placed the replacement order. The call was lengthy but the service rep was friendly and cooperative. I got the new laptop 3 days later, it is light weight but the look is not very appealing (compared to the pics online) and looks cheap. The display is OK, not too great and not too bad, just OK. So far, I have no issues with the performance, will use the laptop for a month and update my status. But receiving a damaged laptop doesn't have a good start and takes a few days to get over it (nervous about how the new one will perform).",2
This lap is actually great for beginners. But make sure you buy this laptop under 27k coz there were times when this laptop was sold nearly at 22k. Keypad travel is great. Battery is average. Camera is really super waste. FHD screen does its job.,4

"When I tried to register on Lenovo website it said the product is already registered and I have just 8 months of warranty remaining, basically it's a used product, used for at least 4 months.

Pros:
1. Good battery life, 6-8 hours
2. Full laptop experience in small size
3. The internal GPU, Intel UHD 600, is good enough to decode 4k@60fps, but somehow the browsers don't use it properly (may be windows issues or the drivers), downloaded files play smoothly in VLC, but browser can't handle 4k (there are frame drops)
4. You get keyboard and active pen in the box

Cons:
1. Not anti glare screen
2. It's 1280x800 screen, not FHD
3. Without keyboard attached you can't use USB, as both USBs are in the keyboard
4. Even without keyboard it feels heavy
5. Huge bezels
6. No ethernet port
7. No HDMI port
8. The screen is a fingerprint magnet, you'll need a screen protector

Okayish cameras.
It will take sometime to be used to the keyboard, it's small with low key travel.

You can access the boot menu by pressing fn+f12.
It is possible to run Linux but issues with screen orientation and touchscreen will give you hard time. I tried installing linux (Ubuntu and Manjaro) it booted and installed successfully, by default they boot in portrait mode, you can rotate the screen from settings, but it doesn't rotate the touch, Manjaro sometimes caused black screen during screen rotation. Overall, you can install linux but you'll have hard time using the touchscreen.

Buy if you want to do basic things like editing office files, browsing, watching videos. It's not made for gaming, video editing, programming etc.
Update to windows 10 20H2 and use debloat scripts after that performance will be better.",2
"Smallest laptop I have ever seen. But, Thanks to the Tablet mode & Touch Screen.

Bad product,1
Too small,2
The bezel of the screen is quite large that minimise the display. But the display is quite good with a 24bit. And the touch responsive is also good. I am disappointed with this as i cannot run Adobe Indesign with it. But the ms office responsive is very good. The battery life is also great. The keypad though needs time to adebt to our huge fingers. Over-all this product is a great replacement to the ms surface-pro.,4

3.Screen quality is bad",3
I started checking this product for couple of days. All the features are good except its battery backup. It comes for 3 hrs only after complete charge compared to what they claim. It confirms me that HP laptops battery backups are usually not good compared to other product vendors. :(,4
"Have been using the laptop for two weeks now. Performs really well and is faster than 10th generation laptops (compared start/shut and tab openings). Users might face nominal installation issues, better to have a good data plan ready on the day of initialization as a lot of drivers along with windows 10 components are updated.",5
Could have done better with the battery backup.....charging is fast though....,4
"I'm using it for almost a month now, mostly for business use. It gives great performance advantage and portability. Best part is it boots up pretty fast, thanks to the SSD.
Touch screen is good.
Finger print scanner sometimes doesn't work, but it was expected.
I haven't tried any games on it. But have done some image processing, which provided good response and performance.
Speakers are very standard. Better usage is with headsets
I have an issue with the white board. Sometimes during meetings, it hangs up and the entire screen goes frozen. Background processing, or even the call doesn't stop but the screen become inactive. This happened a couple of times.
Camera is a joke.. Still can't believe why they aren't providing a better spec camera in mid range models. It's too basic and performance is pathetic especially in low light situations.
Altogether, it's a pretty nice machine for daily/ business usage with my experience till now.",4
"I have bought the laptop one month before and I now I am facing the problem of overheating just of 1 to 2 hours use. Due to overheating, none of the browsers are opening and laptop is hanging. I have one year warranty on the laptop so I want to resolve my issue.",2

Night mode keypad glow is impressive and battery backup is not so bad. Size is smaller than regular gigantic lappy's. Haven't faced any issue so far with heating effect. All in all a good buy for multipurpose use be it coding, multimedia and gaming. Thank you Amazon for bringing this to me.",5

"Okay. So I dont like macbooks to work on as windows gets the work done faster.
I joined an org and they provided me this new laptop. Upon 2 days of using this laptop here is my review

- The screen is a bezel less screen with true and natural colors with very good brightness. So in a way its a good experience
- Speakers are surround sound speakers and sounds good but starts cracking even in a little higher volume. So overall its not good as I dont like speakers not tested for their maximum sound quality especially when it starts cracking. Says a lot about the low quality devices put on the laptop
- HEATING ISSUE: Now this is the biggest problem. I had really thought that this was a problem of the past and with new technologies laptops might have taken care of it. This laptop OVERHEATS. It is really really difficult keeping it on lap and work although this being a laptop. It heats so much that you have to keep it on a surface all the time. This is the worst for a laptop. I just HATE this
- Battery: Battery is pretty small and I suppose lasts only for 5 hours with a full charge whereas it takes 3 hours to full charge. I did not like this
- Backlight: Backlight is bright but the color is just okayish. It effects your eyes and does not give a soothing effect.
- Keyboard: They have done a good job in keyboard, it makes your typing fast and easy due to bigger keys and better placement. So it think its a positive

All in all I did not like this laptop at all and at this price point really expect a lot from a laptop. I DO NOT recommend this laptop to anyone buying a work laptop. Please review this carefully before buying.

I did not like it at all and hence I am sharing this experience with everyone before you buy this laptop",1
"Good for routine work ! Good battery back up back light and Performance !
Cons No pen and little heavy",5
Horrible customer support. Please be careful they don't provide services and have to follow up more than 2wk for sure. Dell and Lenovo are far better.,1
"Using for a month and happy with performance. With fingerprint scan option laptop starts in no time. Overall very fast and responsive.
I have safeguarded it with extra warrenty as it dies not look robust.",4
Got the laptop 2 months back and it suddenly stopped working. As per HP support there is a problem with mother board which can be replaced (since it’s under warranty) but no update from HP from more than 3 weeks now. Tired of calling them everyday. Really regretting the decision to buy this laptop. Please don’t buy HP laptops.,1
